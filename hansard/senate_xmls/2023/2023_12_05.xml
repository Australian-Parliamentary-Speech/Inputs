                  </a>  I'm perfectly relaxed, President. On the day of the judgement, the government said it would wait but, instead, it didn't take its own advice—it didn't do as it said it would do—it just went on and released individual, after individual, after individual, who it was known posed a threat to the Australian community. In this place, and in the other place, we saw the government face questions from Mr Dutton, from Senator Cash and from Senator Paterson about the risks that these individuals posed, but the government couldn't stick to its own decision; it couldn't detain them and await the statement of reasons. Instead, it proceeded to release them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then what did we see from this government, that had failed in its handling of the case and had failed on the day of, and on the days following, the statement of reasons? We saw them bring legislation to this parliament—legislation that, again, reflected calls the opposition had made for the government to look, where these individuals had been released, at how they could be tracked and followed, and what steps could be taken. What did the government do? It released the legislation at breakfast time. At 8 am the opposition were given briefings on that legislation. And what did we do in response to it? We went away and had a look to see whether we could make it tougher. The government went out publicly, and said, 'This is as tough as it gets!' That was at breakfast time. Guess what? By lunchtime they had accepted all the amendments from the opposition—all six amendments from the opposition to make the legislation tougher were accepted by lunchtime by the Albanese government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they failed in the case's handling, failed in the immediate response and failed in the first package of legislation. We're now having to work through further packages of legislation with this government. We are taking the diligence and time to try to ensure that it is done thoroughly. It is so critical for the opposition to keep a check on this government, because they're not up to it! And they've shown they're not up to it time and time again. Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil clearly demonstrated that they're not up to it, which is why Prime Minister Albanese should at last show some leadership and sack these hopeless ministers—</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, we've all seen this story time after time. There is a dark thread that runs through the politics of both major parties in this country, and that dark thread has resulted in death and in refugees and people seeking asylum being brutalised and demonised in immigration detention, both on Manus Island and Nauru and here onshore in Australia. We know this story because we have seen it time after time and seen the rampant politicisation of the issue by the party that now sits in opposition. In Australia, the News Corp media is coming in behind that party, magnifying their fake, confected emergencies with regard to refugees and people seeking asylum and magnifying the demonisation of refugees and people seeking asylum. Then the Labor Party is rolling over and capitulating to the Liberals and to the Murdoch media.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what has happened over the past few weeks with regard to the government's response to the recent High Court decision that effectively ruled that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful in Australia, and that is what we are seeing played out here today. I've got some advice for the government: stop letting Mr Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, write your policy on refugees, people seeking asylum and immigration detention, because we all know the dark path that that will lead this country down. It's about time that we collectively stood up for human rights, for proper process, for the rule of law and for the separation of powers in this country. It's about time that we legislated like grown-ups in this place, where we carefully consider our response to things like High Court decisions, not legislate in a shoddy, xenophobic, panicked way because the Labor Party is too weak and cowardly to stand up to Mr Dutton's agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what is going on at the moment. That is what is going on in this debate. I predict that that's what's going to go on over the next 48 hours in this place. If there is one thing we know about Mr Dutton, it's that he has built a career on demonising refugees and people seeking asylum and he's not going to stop now. My last piece of advice to the Labor Party is this: when you appease someone like Mr Dutton, they will simply take everything you give them, take another giant step over to the Right and go again. That's what's going to happen, and it needs to stop.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  Talk about excuses coming from the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the moment, Senator Gallagher, who is sitting there. Wow, what excuses. You have one responsibility as a government—to keep Australians safe—and you have failed miserably. You talk about legal briefings. Well, guess what? We were in negotiations for a legal briefing. The situation we are currently in is, for the record, a direct result of the draconian conditions around the provision of the advice in hard copy only. Guess where the shadow minister is? In his electorate. And guess what? They have said he's got to go to the CPO, which is a 3½ hour drive to actually access the advice. The Attorney-General of Australia will not leave the closeted conditions of his office or have someone drive out and give our shadow minister a copy of the advice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were conducting these negotiations, Senator Gallagher—through you, Chair—in good faith, but, with what you've put on the record today, clearly the government wants to only play political games and nothing more, and that is an absolute disgrace. The relevant shadow minister has been told that unless he drives 3½ hours—because apparently technology doesn't assist—the department can't actually get the advice to him in a confidential manner. We were negotiating with this government in good faith. We'd had one briefing yesterday morning on this, and we were negotiating with this government in good faith. But clearly that good faith has been thrown out the window this morning because you want to play political games. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we have the statement this morning from the Attorney-General of Australia. You have to be kidding me. Let's be clear on what this statement doesn't do. There is nothing in this statement that addresses the fundamental issue that the release of every single one of the 148 detainees was a government decision. Despite what they want to say, it was a decision based on an assessment made by the government of what the High Court had said in its NZYQ decision and a decision based on an assessment by the government in advance of the High Court's statement of reasons. The Attorney-General; the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs; and the Minister for Home Affairs have now resorted to this, and it really is pathetic—seriously. Honestly, someone doing work experience in the Attorney-General's office could have drafted this. It is that pathetic of a statement—to cover their own inadequacies in this regard. Instead of resorting to this kind of petulant rubbish, quite frankly they should be standing in front of the cameras today and apologising to the Australian people for the mess that they have now got Australians in. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the front pages across Australia today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CASH:</span>
                  </a>  I'll read them then. That's even better. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> says 'Freed detainees in alleged assault, drugs charge', and 'asylum creepers'. Guess what? It gets worse when you read what the judge said in 2016, when sentencing one of the released detainees that this government—the Albanese government—has released into the community. The judge said, in 2016, during his sentencing, that this man was 'a danger to the Australian community' and, what is worse, 'an ongoing risk to women'. You have to be kidding me. They have now freed detainees on alleged assault and drugs charges. Then we have the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> of 'Freed fiend on sex charge'. Then we have—let's go through it—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>headline 'Human catastrophe: detainee sex charges'. We can keep going through today's papers. The front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>is 'How could you let this happen?' I'll tell you that that is a very good question. It's sheer incompetence and nothing more. Then, of course, you have the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper today—Anthony DeCeglie is the editor—with the headline that says it all, 'Everything is f-"space"-c-k-e-d'. That's about the only thing you can say about this government at the moment. Anthony De Ceglie, editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span>, you've got it right.</span>

It is not right to conflate broader issues of migration and of the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers with this issue. This is a cohort who have committed offences—some of them are very serious offences—and the approach of the government will be to ensure community safety. That's what we will do. It is a big mistake, in my view, for people on either side of this argument to try and conflate these. It serves the interests of some on the extremes of either side of Australian politics, but it is not in the national interest to conflate these issues.</span>

None of that has been displayed by those opposite, who have just shouted and bellowed and talked tough and come up with nothing that is in the national interest.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I agree with Senator Cash that we should be keeping Australians safe. We've heard Senator Birmingham say that as well. That should be a primary focus for us in this chamber. But the way we do that matters and the way we talk about it matters. Here we are, after agreeing to a program yesterday, now having a debate on the proposed suspension. Yes, this is incredibly important. What we've seen happen in these two cases shouldn't have happened, and we have an obligation to deal with this. But where's the suspension of standing orders for the 60 Australian women and children that have been murdered this year? We talk about keeping Australians safe. Where's the urgency around that? Yes, the new government has done work on coercive control, with the new plan to end violence against women and children, and I give them credit for that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  On behalf of the coalition, I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Independent Review) Bill 2023. The coalition welcomes debate on this long-awaited bill. This was part of the government's election commitments. A review into Infrastructure Australia was conducted. The report landed on Minister King's desk in October last year and, like everything else that lands on Minister King's desk, it sat there for a very, very long time. The government talked a big game about transparency and accountability in the infrastructure pipeline, but we've seen the decisions this government made in its October budget last year: billions of dollars cut from road, rail and dam projects right throughout the country, and the 200-day 'short, sharp review' into the infrastructure pipeline, which again sees projects cut and delayed across the country in our congested suburbs and regional centres. Everything this government does when it comes to infrastructure means cuts or delays.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with great pleasure that I speak on this bill. The coalition has been wanting to debate this bill for months. The government tried to put this into part of the guillotine motion for the end of the week. Guess what! Catherine King doesn't want us to talk about her cuts and delays or how to be more accountable and transparent with the billions of dollars that Commonwealth taxpayers put into—</span>

                    </a>  I'm pretty sure her name is Catherine King, but if you want me to say 'minister' as well—Minister Catherine King doesn't want us to be debating accountability and transparency and doesn't want us talking about this government's plan to bring in 1½ million additional arrivals while simultaneously cutting road and rail projects in our congested suburbs in our capital cities, making it harder for Australians to get home quickly and safely. If you want to know why we bother having an infrastructure pipeline, it is so that Australians have the roads they need to get home swiftly and safely, it is so that out in the regions we have a road network that allows us to get our fabulous product to ports, to capital cities and to markets around the world, and it is so that our truckies can travel on roads that are safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has long delayed debate in this chamber on this bill, dropping it down the bills list each and every week, ensuring it didn't get debated, and then it ended up being part of the guillotine. But I'd like to thank the Greens for supporting the debate this morning. What has the government got to hide? The purpose of this bill is to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act to give partial effect to the government's response to the independent review of Infrastructure Australia, which was released in December last year. I say 'partial' because the review actually recommended a whole raft of changes that the government has decided not to take up. Why? Why don't they want to take up those recommendations? I would suggest it's because the review sought to increase the transparency and accountability to government from Infrastructure Australia, and that's exactly what this minister and this government don't want to see happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will be supporting the passage of this legislation with key amendments. We want to help the government to improve Infrastructure Australia's ability to inform government on national infrastructure priorities and to help inform public debate. Without our amendments and those of other senators, the bill as proposed by the government doesn't go far enough to provide that transparency regarding the nation's infrastructure needs or government priorities. The coalition looks forward to debate on other amendments before the Senate that will enhance transparency and scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the minister's assistance in facilitating a briefing with the department on the bill when it was first introduced to the parliament and for having respectful discussions about the coalition's proposed amendments. I look forward to the government's support for our amendments during the consideration in detail in the committee stage. I also acknowledge the constructive conversations with other senators and with the member for Ryan, the Greens spokesman on infrastructure. I'd also like to acknowledge the contributions to this debate during the debate in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent review was undertaken by Nicole Lockwood and Mike Mrdak, the former secretary of the department. Infrastructure Australia is a corporate Commonwealth entity established by the Rudd government in 2008. It is actually a creation of the current Prime Minister. Infrastructure Australia is the brainchild of Anthony Albanese, and he does not, it seems, want to take on all the recommendations from the independent review. I'm hoping the chamber today can assist the government to make this bill better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 6 of the review suggested Infrastructure Australia's remit be expanded to include social infrastructure. These recommendations were rejected by the government. These are significant recommendations given the infrastructure investment priorities of the Albanese government over the past year. The only significant announcements and commitments into infrastructure since the election have been music and sporting stadiums by the government, and yet, by not supporting the review's recommendations that social infrastructure be part of the remit of Infrastructure Australia, they've explicitly ruled out stadiums and music venues. Billions of dollars of spending in Queensland and in Tasmania for the commitments they've made in those areas won't be subject to examination by Infrastructure Australia. Labor's focus is on stadiums at a time when the national government should be focused on enhancing national productivity to strengthen the economy. The bill repeals almost all of the current functions of Infrastructure Australia provided in sections 5(a) to 5(gb) and in sections 5A to 5C of the current act. In place of Infrastructure Australia's current functions the bill proposes a series of new functions and products to conduct audits or assessments of nationally significant infrastructure determined adequacy and needs, conduct or endorse evaluations of infrastructure projects, develop targeted infrastructure lists and plans and provide advice on nationally significant infrastructure matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review received 59 submissions, held 40 meetings and included approximately 140 participants across government and industry. In October, that review was provided to the government with 16 recommendations and, in particular, the government didn't support the key recommendations to provide enhanced transparency that they promised at the last election. For example, recommended in part 4 of the review was the proposal that Infrastructure Australia provide two new annual statements to the government, which would be publicly tabled, to inform the budget processes and report on the performance of outcomes being achieved by the infrastructure investment program so that the public could actually be assured that the infrastructure spend was being delivered in a way that they assumed was occurring and so that the government would be publicly accountable for the performance. The coalition will be moving an amendment to give effect to recommendation 4 of the review. If supported, the annual statements will provide valuable annual assessments of the effectiveness of the national infrastructure investment into enhancing national productivity as well as the effectiveness of the states and territories in delivering infrastructure projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent review also proposed that the Australian government must formally and publicly respond to Infrastructure Australia's advice, findings and recommendations within six months. This was not supported by the government. What have you got to hide? If Infrastructure Australia—as the brainchild of the current Prime Minister when he was infrastructure minister—isn't the place to give you advice and for you to publicly respond to that advice, to either accept it or reject it, why shouldn't the public know your views as the government? The Australian people can clearly see then that this administration has an aversion to being transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government didn't support the recommendation to form an infrastructure bodies council to enable better collaboration and cooperation between Infrastructure Australia and the states and territories, and that's exactly what the IMF recommended in their advice—that there needs to be greater collaboration and coordination between state and territories infrastructure priorities and builds and the Commonwealth's investment. The IMF never recommended that our infrastructure pipeline be cut and slashed, as Minister King has done over recent weeks, but rather that better collaboration be part of the solution. That also was a recommendation rejected by the government from their own independent review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By replacing the 12-member Infrastructure Australia board with three commissioners, the government is automatically reducing the diversity of expertise at the head of this body. It reduces its independence from government; the views of the minister will hold significant influence within those three commissioners, as direct appointees, and this compares with the current governance arrangements whereby nine infrastructure board members are appointed by the government and three are appointed by recommendations from states and territories. When added to the redefined functions of Infrastructure Australia in this bill, which require the commissioners to have regard to government policies and require them to evaluate infrastructure proposals submitted by the government, it is clear that Infrastructure Australia will enjoy far less independence under Anthony Albanese than it did under the previous coalition government. There is concern that these changes will result in a loss of industry expertise as well as expertise and experience in actually delivering infrastructure projects, particularly in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government made no provision to appoint commissioners who have expertise or experience in issues impacting on regional Australia. Given the importance of our infrastructure build to the regions, to our export task and to the safety of the nine million of us who don't live in capital cities, I think the fact that the government was prepared to accept that we could have diversity in the commissioners around gender but not around geography really shows the deficit approach from this government in ensuring that all Australians enjoy coverage in the type of legislation, the type of arrangements and the type of governance mechanisms it sets up. The Prime Minister promised to govern for all Australians, but those of us that live out in rural and regional Australia feel more and more left behind. The coalition will propose amendments to address this concern, and I encourage the government and all senators to consider supporting these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to making Infrastructure Australia less independent, the government's reforms will make Infrastructure Australia less authoritative—particularly when it comes to the evaluation of infrastructure projects. Firstly, the minister has made it clear that the government wants to shrink the number of projects on the infrastructure priority list; this is mentioned in the EM. Recently, we saw the government cancel $7.4 billion worth of critical infrastructure projects as a result of their review into the infrastructure pipeline. There were 50 projects axed right across Australia. Further, the government proposes that Infrastructure Australia merely endorses project assessments submitted by state and territory governments. This is the government walking away from providing independent oversight and assessment of the priorities of state governments. It's as if that's just a tick and flick by Labor's Infrastructure Australia body for the priorities of state governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth makes a substantial investment in public infrastructure, often investing 50 per cent—or, in regional areas, up to 80 per cent—of the cost of projects that are rolled out. That is a significant amount of money and it deserves a significant say. Australian taxpayers expect the Commonwealth parliament to exercise suitable oversight on that, so that infrastructure projects deliver material benefit and maximum value for investment is secured. This should be an important role for Infrastructure Australia, but will the organisation's ability to provide advice on this be diminished by the requirement in this bill that it endorse the state assessments instead of being required to run an independent ruler over the homework of state and territory governments? We can look at my home state of Victoria, at the pathetic proposal of the Suburban Rail Loop and the lack of rigour around that particular project. It will have the Commonwealth and state governments on the hook for in excess of $125 billion at current costings, and that seems a little remiss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government has not demonstrated any urgency in progressing this legislation. The federal coalition aims to assist the government by passing this legislation with amendments, despite our concerns that this bill will result in an Infrastructure Australia having less independence and less authority. Working together, I'm confident that we will support sensible amendments which are designed to ensure that commissioners have experience in delivering infrastructure in the regions and in delivering improved transparency for nationally significant infrastructure investments, including social infrastructure. On this basis, the legislation should pass this week and Infrastructure Australia will commence in the new year with its new mandate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the changes proposed under this bill, Infrastructure Australia will be a less influential body under the Labor government than when the Prime Minister first envisaged it when he was the minister responsible for infrastructure 15 years ago.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill repeals most of the current functions of Infrastructure Australia and proposes a series of new functions. Irrespective of this review into Infrastructure Australia, it's crystal clear that infrastructure is not a priority of this government. In the May budget, there wasn't one mention of the word 'infrastructure' in the Treasurer's budget speech. The government appears to have problems in saying the word 'infrastructure'. They can't even say it! It's just like the other word that they can't bring themselves to say: productivity. There's no mention of infrastructure and there's certainly very little mention by this government of productivity. They aren't doing anything to aid productivity—in fact, this government's agenda is impinging upon productivity. This is ironic, given the fundamental importance of both in advancing the nation's prosperity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we know that infrastructure drives efficiency, supports our economy, improves productivity and delivers safety improvements for our community. When in opposition, Labor talked a big game on transparency—a big game! But, in government, it's been anything but transparent. Whether it's about the Mobile Black Spot Program or, more recently, about operating a protection racket for the airline industry or stifling aviation competition, it has been evident that this government is severely lacking in transparency. So it's hardly surprising that the reform in this bill will make Infrastructure Australia even less independent. Will the government seek to appoint union officials to Infrastructure Australia? Probably—that's what they do. We see it all over the place. That's what they do; they stack it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But why are infrastructure and productivity important? And why is it that the government can't bring themselves to say the 'I' word and the 'P' word? Why can't they? The recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> highlights the nexus between infrastructure and productivity. Those over there, the government, might want to listen to this because this is important. Even the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> highlighted the importance of both. It said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Infrastructure is important for supporting socio-economic development as the population grows. It enables economic and productivity growth by reducing congestion and allowing goods and people to move quickly and efficiently around the country and internationally.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So where does all this leave much-needed projects in my community—projects like the Nicholson Road and Garden Street upgrade in the seats of Tangney and Burt? It's right there on the border of those two very important electorates in Western Australia. I'll quote Infrastructure Australia's own website, which says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Perth is experiencing worsening road congestion. The 2019 Australian Infrastructure Audit estimated that congestion in Perth will cost $3.1 billion per annum in 2031.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year I spoke about this vital infrastructure project that's in my patron seats of Tangney and Burt and that's at serious risk of being cut or delayed by the Albanese Labor government. The roundabout on Nicholson Road and Garden Street is a significant bottleneck hotspot in Perth. The traffic congestion caused by the bottlenecks in and around this intersection significantly impacts on freight getting through and into Canning Vale and other parts of the electorate and on people getting to their job and then to their home every day. Quite simply, it negatively impacts on productivity, which, under this government, is at a seven-year low—and it's doing very little about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government, in its final budget, secured the funding to get this project going. I pay tribute to the former member for Tangney Ben Morton, who championed this project for a long time and got it locked into the budget. It was committed in the budget, yet this government has dithered on this project for so long. The then Labor opposition thankfully matched this funding, and the Western Australian Labor government also matched it; they committed to a fifty-fifty arrangement to ensure that this vital project—that's what Infrastructure Australia identified it as—would go ahead for the total cost of $80 million. It was a win-win for the community because, irrespective of which party was going to go on to win government, this project would get done—it would happen. But, since then, this project has been wholly mishandled and bungled by the government from the time that they took office. This project, which has already been delayed since the October budget, is an example of the critical community infrastructure projects that are at risk of being further postponed by that ridiculous 90-day review that turned into a 200-plus-day review. Delays beget delays, and that's what we're seeing with this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I spoke about it March, I have visited this intersection—I travel through it all the time because my parents literally just live about 500 metres from there—in my capacity as a senator for Western Australia. I've gone there and met with people. I met with Senator McKenzie. We went down and had a look at this intersection, and Senator McKenzie saw firsthand the significant congestion and the danger that's caused as people get in and out of that intersection. It's a dangerous intersection. It's a Black Spot Program intersection in Perth, and people know it's dangerous. And families going through there are put at risk every time. Disappointingly, but unsurprisingly, zero progress has occurred. There's been absolutely nothing, except you just see some sand tumbling over the area from across the road, where you've got the future Nicholson Road train station that's getting built. Again, there are delays involved in that project, too. But that's a state government issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was evident last year that this project would be delayed, as the Albanese government cut $3.5 million from the October budget. Planning works for this project should have begun in the second half of last year, but, in estimates just a few week ago, I asked the infrastructure department about this project. They had to shuffle through their books, and that's fair enough, as there are many projects going on around the place. But eventually they found the project in amongst their briefing papers, and they told me that nothing's occurred and there's been no planning. They just sought to blame Main Roads Western Australia. It's a good organisation, but, nonetheless, because no leadership has been provided by this government, this project's just sat idle for too long. There was the 90-day review, which ended up being 200-day review. It just further delays these things. It's absolutely disappointing because this is a vital project for this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is missing in action, just like the hapless state Labor government is missing in action. Their delivery of projects since they were elected eight or more years ago is dismal. The only significant project they've managed to open—a project that has been delivered and completed—is the Forrestfield link, which is the new train line that goes out to the Perth Airport. But guess what? That actually started under the previous government, so even the WA Labor government have got nothing to show when it comes to infrastructure. And it's a shame because Western Australians are missing out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, where is the member for Tangney and the member for Burt? Where's their advocacy on this issue? This is right on their boundary, and they should be working together. There are two of them. You don't just have to rely on one of the members to advocate for this project; they've got the benefit of having two of them advocating for this project. Where is Mr Keogh? Where is the minister, no less? He's got the ear of the Prime Minister. He should be right in there. He should be advocating for this project to hurry up and get ahead. Why is there no planning? I've met with the local council. I thought maybe they would know what's going on. They said, 'No, there's nothing happening here.' Now the government has said they're going to continue with this project, but, because of their delays, because of their inability to lead, this project is delayed even further. They've got to get onto it. This is an important project for the community, and they're failing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could rattle off projects right across the metropolitan areas, right across the country areas. One project that I know you'll give credit to, Acting Deputy President Sterle—they've shown some leadership on this—is the building of the new bridge at Fitzroy Crossing. It shows that, when you're serious about something, when you get the right proponents behind it, you can make it happen; you can do stuff quickly. That bridge is phenomenal. I know you've been there, Acting Deputy President. That bridge is a big area, and they've been able to build that thing quickly. It demonstrates that, if you show leadership, if you put the effort in, if you work with the community, you can get the results. So it's possible to do it, but they've demonstrated time and again that they're not serious about infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke earlier about the importance of it—that, if you link infrastructure with a need to addresses congestion and safety, you improve productivity. And boy do we need that right now! We need a lift in productivity in this nation, otherwise we're going keep chasing inflation. Wage rises are just going to be trying to keep up with the rising costs of delivering, but, if we get a productivity dividend, then we can actually get real wages moving. We can actually provide for Australians in a meaningful way, and that's what needs to happen. But this government, sadly, is asleep at the wheel. They've got to get on with it, and the only way that they can do that is to show some leadership and some action.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  First of all, I'd like to congratulate Senator O'Sullivan for his very fine words reflecting on our home state of Western Australia and the severe problems with infrastructure that we do have there. The fact is Western Australia is still a growing state, delivering not just for the economy of WA but for Australia. The fact is the Labor government, when it crows about its surplus, is really crowing about the impact of the revenues particularly from my home state of Western Australia when it comes to the iron ore and oil and gas industries that have delivered rivers of gold into both federal and state coffers for generations now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We require a big and sustained infrastructure spend to allow for that growth to continue, to allow Western Australia to be its best. And what do we get from this federal government, when it came into power? It sits on the hose. Supposedly, it was going to be for 90 days. It ended up being for over six months, wasn't it, Senator McKenzie? They put these items under review for 200 days. That delay, in a high inflationary environment, when so many projects were effectively put on hold for six months, means those costs are never coming out of the pipeline now. Those costs are baked in. We're not going to see—well, hopefully we're not going to see; you never know with this government—a deflationary environment, so those extra costs that were baked into the infrastructure pipeline during that six months of delay are there forever. That means that not only will the projects that have seen cuts directly out of this infrastructure review suffer but all those other projects will suffer from increased costs due to delay. So we're going to see a pipeline shrunk over time as inflation eats up the capacity of Australia to build those projects, and we are going to see, particularly, my home state of Western Australia suffering. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is always the first cab off the rank to suffer under this Labor government? It's the bush; it's the regions. Let's look at the direct cuts that were made through this infrastructure review in WA. I've talked about these before and I'm only going to speak briefly, because we are under a guillotine here today. We are going to see this issue and many others chopped off at the knees without full debate. But I am going to go, very quickly, through those projects that were cut in my home state of WA and reflect on their locations: the Great Southern Secondary Freight Network, the Marble Bar Road upgrade, the Moorine Rock to Mount Holland road upgrades, and the Pinjarra Heavy Haulage Deviation, stage 1 and 2. I ask those in Western Australia listening: what do those projects all have in common? Guess what? They're not in Perth. Guess what? They're in the regions. Now is anyone at home listening along—</span>

                    </a>  surprised by that, Senator Pratt? Of course they're not surprised by that, because they know that both the state and federal Labor governments hate regional Western Australia. There've been cuts to regional representation, cuts to regional infrastructure spending and so many attacks on the bush that I'm not going to list them all here today. It's sustained, it's real, people know it and are paying attention to it. And it's not just those in the bush that know, recognise and realise what Labor is doing to the regions; those in the city have started to pay attention as well, and they are starting to look at what's happening to the regions and reflect on the fact that those wealth-generating components of the West Australian economy—be it the mining sector in the north, the oil and gas sector in the north or the agricultural sector north-east and south-west of Perth—are the ones who are suffering under state and federal Labor governments who don't give a damn about the bush. </span>

Infrastructure Australia was created by Labor to provide expert advice to government regarding infrastructure priorities across the nation. Under the Liberals and Nationals, the organisation was left to drift, with partisan board appointments and a lack of clear direction. This is why, during the election campaign, Labor committed to an independent review of Infrastructure Australia. </span>

This bill will implement part of the government response to the independent review, to ensure IA is the independent adviser to the Australian government on nationally significant infrastructure investment. The bill provides Infrastructure Australia with a clear purpose and streamlined functions that align with the government's strategic infrastructure priorities. It will promote harmonisation of evaluation processes across jurisdictions and remove duplicative processes, acknowledging the existing assessment frameworks and capabilities of the states. </span>

An updated statement of expectations will also be issued, to provide IA with guidance on implementing most of the remaining recommendations of the independent review. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a new object to the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 that identifies Infrastructure Australia's mandate as the Commonwealth government's independent adviser on nationally significant infrastructure investment planning and project prioritisation. Infrastructure Australia's functions and product suite will be more focused, including developing a smaller, more targeted infrastructure priority list that prioritises nationally significant infrastructure proposals for consideration by the federal government. </span>

The bill will identify that Infrastructure Australia's functions are to be guided by the Australian government's infrastructure investment objectives and strategic priorities, which may be directed in a public statement.</span>

The commissioners will be the accountable authority and will be appointed by the responsible minister based on their expertise, skills, experience and knowledge; gender; and geographical representation. The CEO is appointed by the commissioners. Along with a new provision to undertake inquiries into matters relating to nationally significant infrastructure, the commissioners will be able to examine and report on the complex ecosystem for nationally significant infrastructure in an integrated way.</span>

It will refocus IA to provide important and strategic advice to the Australian government. Infrastructure Australia will provide relevant and timely expert advice to the Australian government on infrastructure, planning and project prioritisation that has appropriate regard to the government's infrastructure investment policies and objectives. The new governance model will ensure that Infrastructure Australia has the eminence, authority and standing to be a national leader and coordinator among infrastructure advisory bodies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Infrastructure Australia was established by the now Prime Minister, it was created in an apolitical way and led by an expert board headed by Sir Rod Eddington. Infrastructure Australia was created to take politics out of major projects and to create clear guidance on what government and industry need to invest in and when those investments should be made. The former Labor government listened to Infrastructure Australia and invested in every one of its priority projects. All of this changed under the previous government. They destroyed Infrastructure Australia as a major economic body and instead used it as a vehicle to give jobs to their mates. They ignored Infrastructure Australia's priority list and instead invested in imaginary car parks rather than major projects that would lay the foundations for the nation's future economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government infrastructure investment decisions will be informed by independent expert advice from Infrastructure Australia. It's advice that will be more targeted to the government's needs by aligning Infrastructure Australia's mandate and product suite with the government's policy objectives. The changes made to the bill will require Infrastructure Australia to develop a more targeted product suite that has regard to the government's infrastructure investment policies and objectives. Changes to IA's governance arrangements and candidate selection process, along with the establishment of an advisory council, will increase the expertise and standing of Infrastructure Australia. Giving Infrastructure Australia a more central role in informing government decisions, such as through the budget process, ensures that Infrastructure Australia's work is more closely embedded into government processes, which has not been the case in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what the bill will do, it introduces a new object into the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 that identifies Infrastructure Australia's mandate as the Commonwealth government's independent adviser on nationally significant infrastructure investment, planning and project prioritisation. It will be more focused and will include smaller, more targeted infrastructure priority lists that prioritise nationally significant infrastructure investment proposals from Australian state and territory governments. The bill will enable Infrastructure Australia to endorse the work of state and territory infrastructure bodies' project evaluations, thus reducing duplication and uplifting jurisdictions to a nationally consistent approach. The bill will also identify that Infrastructure Australia's functions are to be guided by the Australian government's infrastructure investment objectives. IA will be governed by three commissioners and a CEO. The commissioners will be the accountable authority and will be appointed by the responsible minister, as I mentioned before. The bill will ensure that Infrastructure Australia is empowered to carry out its role as an independent adviser.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, these changes will remove unnecessary processes and build on the strong relationships with states and territories, which will harmonise processes, leading to better advice and recommendations. Importantly, Infrastructure Australia will maintain its independence, ensuring that it continues to provide impartial advice to the Australian government, particularly on infrastructure project selection and prioritisation for investment in projects needed the most. The new governance model will ensure Infrastructure Australia has the eminence, authority and standing to be a national leader and coordinator amongst infrastructure advisory bodies. The three commissioners will collectively have strong and relevant expertise and be responsible for the delivery of Infrastructure Australia's functions. Whilst this bill implements the recommendations of the independent review of Infrastructure Australia requiring legislative changes, a new statement of expectations will be issued to Infrastructure Australia to implement the remaining recommendations of the review. Together these changes will re-establish Infrastructure Australia as the Commonwealth expert adviser on infrastructure of national significance. I would again like to thank senators for their constructive contributions in consideration of this bill. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Before the 2022 election, the current Prime Minister said the Labor government would refer matters to Infrastructure Australia before making commitments to nationally significant infrastructure. He actually said that in his budget-in-reply speech prior to becoming Prime Minister. Then, at the election and in the October 2022 budget, the government committed $2.2 billion to the Melbourne Suburban Rail Loop project. This was without a business case or any oversight or advice from Infrastructure Australia. This was an attempt to prop up his Labor mate Daniel Andrews ahead of the November 2022 Victorian election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Suburban Rail Loop has been widely criticised, not just by the Victorian Auditor-General but even by economists, such as Chris Richardson, and by <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> on the ABC last night. It is a project where the first stage, costing $35 billion, is currently unfunded but works by the Victorian government have commenced. The Victorian Auditor-General has been very critical of the project and just last week issued a report critical of cost blowouts. The Victorian Parliamentary Budget Office has suggested that the cost of the Suburban Rail Loop could be in excess of $125 billion. Other estimates have it reaching up to $200 billion, such as the estimate by respected economist Chris Richardson, who also said that if the Commonwealth is cancelling projects, as we've seen in the last couple of weeks, this is the 'biggest and baddest' and that it is the project he would have started with. If you're going to be cancelling infrastructure projects in this country, this is the project that Chris Richardson would have started with. The government, however, committed $2.2 billion to this project to get it started, despite knowing that the Victorian government would have to come back cap in hand to acquire another $9 billion to at least make its completion possible. Last night, on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> report experts, including the Grattan Institute, called for the program to be scrapped.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these calls from Richardson, from the Grattan Institute, from auditors-general, from the public and from Labor premiers up and down the east coast, who would rather that projects in their home states hadn't been cancelled than that billions of dollars were funnelled into this soon-to-be white elephant, the Victorian government is looking to sign another $3 billion to $4 billion contract for construction, when we know what the IMF said about collaboration with states and territories. The Victorian government, as of October estimates, has still been withholding information from Infrastructure Australia about the Suburban Rail Loop project. Minister, under the government's reform of Infrastructure Australia, is it the government's intention that, instead of doing its own assessment of the Suburban Rail Loop, the agency would merely be endorsing the business case undertaken by the Victorian government agency?</span>

We've said we're committed to delivering on all our election commitments. The minister has been clear that she expects the Victorian government to take the business case for Suburban Rail Loop to Infrastructure Australia for assessment. No further Commonwealth investment in this project will happen, but we are committed to delivering on our election commitment.</span>

The government can request this work through the statement of expectations.

Fifty projects across Australia were cancelled, but the review conducted by former secretary Mike Mrdak recommended that 82 projects be cancelled. Minister King has refused to release the list of projects recommended for cancellation by Mr Mrdak's review. This raises serious questions as to whether the 50 projects the government has cancelled are actually the same projects that were recommended to be cancelled and whether there wasn't a little swiftie done in the minister's office between the projects recommended for cancellation by Mike Mrdak and those that were actually cancelled by the government. The fact that projects cancelled by the government include projects that were already under construction, which were meant to be out of scope of the independent review—projects such as the M7-M12 interchange in Western Sydney—adds further weight to the concerns of politicisation of the independent review's findings. Why won't the government be transparent and release the full list of projects recommended to be delivered?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Mr Mrdak, in that review, did a full assessment of the full pipeline of projects not yet under construction. He recommended a number be cancelled. I know Mike Mrdak and I'm pretty sure he would've been quite specific about which projects needed to be cancelled. He recommended some projects be delayed and further work be undertaken before fully committing to them. He also recommended that some projects receive additional funding. Why won't the government release the lists that Mike Mrdak handed the minister so it can be transparent around the decisions taken by Minister King?</span>

I fully appreciate that they should stay confidential between the Commonwealth and the state. The request of the Senate was for the original lists. Minister King has released publicly and in full a number of independent reviews she has undertaken. There's the maritime strategic fleet review, the independent review of Inland Rail, the independent review of national partnership agreements—I could go on and on. She's been very transparent and released the whole report and the government response, yet on this one she's refused. I'm not interested in the private negotiations between Commonwealth and state. I am interested in the full independent review and, in particular, the list of projects that the government was handed by the independent reviewers.</span>

I assume, given the remit of this bill, that they're going to be within the remit of Infrastructure Australia. Can you confirm that the public aspect of the $328 billion of energy transition infrastructure will be assessed by Infrastructure Australia? Obviously, it's just the public aspect of that; there'll be private investment there as well. But can you assure the Senate that Infrastructure Australia will assess the energy transition infrastructure in coming years?</span>

The deal you've done with the Greens on social infrastructure today means that those significant infrastructure projects—in the billions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money—will have no independent oversight, will not have the ruler run over them by Infrastructure Australia, as was promised by the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition seeking to hold government. Why are you explicitly seeking to rule out looking at the Macquarie Harbour project, the Brisbane Live arena and the Melbourne Suburban Rail Loop? What have you got to hide?</span>

The government has robust processes in place. I know you're obsessed with the Suburban Rail Loop. I thought that, when Dan Andrews retired, it might have meant you'd find a new hobby horse. Infrastructure Australia have said that outer suburban transport in Melbourne is a priority. As we said, there would be no further investment from the federal government until that is done. We made an election commitment with regard to the Suburban Rail Loop. We're determined to deliver on it.</span>

It'll result in significant change and public accountability, which Infrastructure Australia needs to subject itself to. It was an actual recommendation from the review that the government has refused to adopt. And so, in the principle of us assisting Minister King to be the minister she should be, if an independent review recommends a certain pathway forward to increase transparency and accountability, we're going to help the government be their best selves when it comes to this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate today gets rid of the 12-member board of Infrastructure Australia and reduces it to three government appointed commissioners. State and territory governments have no say in who is now running the place. Minister King will hand-pick three commissioners, and none of those commissioners, under the bill before us without this amendment, would be required to have experience in delivering infrastructure across rural and regional Australia. Some examples of nation-building projects already in the infrastructure pipeline include sealing the Tanami Road across Western Australia and the Northern Territory, building infrastructure resilience in the north-west of our nation, sealing the Outback Way from Queensland to Western Australia and the Inland Rail from Melbourne to Brisbane. All of these projects require significant consultation and engagement with local communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen from this government—this city-centric Labor-Greens government—is that they don't like to get out in the regions, sit down and speak to our communities. We saw it with the water bill last week. Minister Plibersek was found wanting. The Senate inquiries, run by the Labor Party, refused to go out into places like Griffith, Deniliquin, Echuca, Mildura and Dirranbandi—all those communities that are going to be significantly and negatively impacted by the legislation that the Labor Party and the Greens put on. The big thing about leadership is you make the decision but you've got to be accountable and responsible for your decision-making. You have to face up to the people that your decisions hurt and you have to explain to them why you're doing it, but this government ducks for cover each and every time. That's why, for the opposition, for the Liberal and the National parties, it's incredibly important that at least one of those commissioners has an understanding, appreciation and experience of rural and regional Australia.</span>

                    </a>  I know, Senator Duniam; it's hard to believe. It's a humble ask on behalf of the nine million Australians who do not live in capital cities. If consultation with affected communities and landholders is inadequate or non-existent, projects can be delayed, potentially for years. We're seeing that now with the rollout of transmission lines and renewable projects in rural and regional communities, because you don't do the consultation. You assume you can just roll into town and everyone's going to bow down and say, 'Thank you, Ma'am; thank you, Sir. Thank you for your attention,' while you destroy their lives and their livelihoods.</span>

If it does, I'd like to be assured and have comfort that someone around that table understands where I come from and what the impact of that will be on us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You need genuine consultation. It's very important for Infrastructure Australia, including at the level of the commissioners, to have an understanding of the regions and how to engage with them. It's also important that Infrastructure Australia, from the commissioners down, understand business case assessments and that they will need to factor in different reasons for large regional projects when comparing investment priorities for projects in heavily congested areas like capital cities. How do you say a major project, like sealing the Tanami, stacks up against something in a suburb when you're only going to use population as your base variable? I'm looking forward to the support of the Senate to ensure that someone, amongst those commissioners, has experience in the regions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition does not seek to frustrate the government's decision to replace a board with commissioners, even though it's not clear this reform will make material improvements to the organisation. We recognise that the independent review proposed three alternative models for governance of Infrastructure Australia. One of those models was to retain a board model, although streamline it. The panel's preferred model was to adopt the commissioner model before the Senate today. What we seek to do is strengthen the bill to ensure regional perspectives are not lost to the peak governing forum of the body.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I note there will be an advisory council established to provide advice to the Infrastructure Australia commissioners. This advisory council has not been referenced in the bill, and therefore parliament will not have oversight as to how the members of the advisory council will be chosen. There is no guarantee anyone from the advisory council will be from a regional area or have connections to the regions. We're not allowed to comment on that, because it's not part of the bill. That's why we've chosen the amendment that I'm moving now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that at least three of the six to seven advisory council members will be senior officials from PM&amp;C, the Treasury and Infrastructure. The government's priorities will be well represented. The government's going to have its fingers all over Infrastructure Australia—deep state, right down into the heart of Infrastructure Australia. You'll be lucky to have a regular person's perspective or expertise on how to deliver a project or how to consult with communities, because it's going to be filled with government bureaucrats. There's no guarantee the regions will have a voice, and so it's all the more important that at least one commissioner has substantial connection to the regions. The amendment doesn't tie the government's hands to require at least one commissioner to live in the regions. It understands you can take the girl out of the country but you can't take the country out of the girl. It is a world view. It is a perspective that is engrained in you from a very early age. It doesn't matter what side of the chamber you sit on.

She is someone who is really proud of her history working in that area. So the government ensure that we have really strong voices from regional Australia. We're happy to support this amendment to ensure that there is someone with some regional heritage in the Infrastructure Australia commission. We're ensuring that, in many ways, we're delivering for regional Australia at the same time through other government priorities as well.</span>

We support the proposals that Labor has put forward to improve scrutiny and planning for infrastructure projects. Labor's independent review of Infrastructure Australia appears to be a step in the right direction for transparency, but this must include Labor's own commitments as well. We are in a cost-of-living crisis, and people are rightly sceptical about big, flashy infrastructure announcements—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  It's a delight to be able to speak in the Nature Repair Market Bill debate, which is something that has had a rather protracted examination through the Senate committee process. It has taken a few turns that I confess have surprised me, but let's take stock of where we're at with regard to this legislation: how we arrived at it, the perceived need for it and why the government is now apparently rushing this legislation through, despite only a few days ago having a further four months of consideration by a Senate committee to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the history. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee on 30 March this year with a reporting date at that point in time of 1 August. An extension was granted to extend examination of that bill, given the frankly near universal condemnation of this legislation, to the beginning of November this year. Again it was extended, at the request of the government. It was the committee chair, Senator Grogan, who is a terrific chair I might add, who suggested that the minister may be very interested indeed in having the committee report extended. The minister was very keen to extend that date based on the comments of the chair of the committee on 30 June, when that extension was granted, through to 18 April, which was when the bill was supposed to be reporting as at the end of last week.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, out of nowhere, with just a couple of days notice, we get this indication from the government that legislation needed to be brought on urgently and the committee reporting date be brought forward by four months. It was rather a stunning move, I've got to say, when, as I said before, there was near universal condemnation for the way the government had constructed this legislation, how they had consulted on it and how, frankly, they had ignored many of the pleas from stakeholders to look at how best they could structure the legislation. I gather the government could see the writing on the wall, hence the extension, but somehow something has happened in recent days which has precipitated this expedited bringing on of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concerns of the stakeholders were many and varied. The most common theme threaded through all of these submissions by people from the environmental movement, the ENGOs through to the business community, was in fact that we should be dealing with the reforms to the EPBC Act, the national environmental approvals legislation, which has been reviewed by former director of the ACCC Professor Graeme Samuel. Deal with that first. Get the overarching framework legislation in place before we progress to dealing with all of the other bits of legislation. That was a view shared by the Australian Greens and many of the other members of the Senate crossbench. It's something that the government completely ignored, so here we are today rushing this through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was clear from the contributions by many in the Senate committee hearings and based on indications made publicly that the bill would be opposed. The Senate committee report was provided to senators at the end of last week, with roughly a day to respond. Interestingly, there are two dissenting reports: one from coalition senators which clearly indicates we will be opposing this legislation because it is bad legislation, and one from the Australian Greens political party. I'll be interested to see whether the Australian Greens stick to their dissenting report, or whether it was just words at a point in time which can be easily expunged from the record. We will see though.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we are today having this legislation rushed through. Four months of scrutiny has been cut off completely with no notice. A deal has been done—a deal, clearly, that was done on the same day these committee reports were tabled, including the dissenting reports. A deal has been done of which we do not have the details. A deal has been done which will receive no scrutiny, because, of course, the Australian Labor Party in partnership with the Australian Greens political party have decided to end scrutiny: 'We don't need to see anymore. We don't need to ask any more questions. It's not your business. Good luck.' And here we are having the bill rushed through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I think it's important for us to examine some of the elements that have raised concern by way of evidence provided to the committee, which I'm sure other senators paid attention to. Professor Helene Marsh, Chair of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we would agree that trying to harmonise this bill and the reforms in the EPBC legislation—and particularly the standards associated with subordinate legislation associated with those reforms will be very important. We'd like to see the whole package harmonised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it's about the EPBC Act coming through first and not rushing this. Kurt Winter, Director of Corporate Transition at the Carbon Market Institute, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… issues around how the market is used by the private sector and then demand driver really need to be clarified before this bill is progressed. We think that as a matter of priority clarity should be provided around reforms to the EPBC Act …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the EPBC Act reforms and, indeed, some of those critical Chubb review recommendations should be a matter of priorities, given that much of this market is premised on some of those underpinning legislative instruments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anna Vella, a committee member of the Australian environment and planning law group of the legal practice section at the Law Council of Australia, said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Nature Repair Market Bill, if passed, must work seamlessly with the EPBC Act going forward, which means we need to understand reforms being proposed to the latter act—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the latter act, I will point out to those listening, is something that will be sitting off in the never-never. This is legislation we were going to see by the end of the year. Well, here we are, with just a couple of sitting days left, and of course that legislation is nowhere to be seen. The consultation process took place with the Australian Labor Party's select group of supporters, who have been a part of this process all the way through. They were given something like 50 pages of a handful of high-level principles, which are supposed to replace the more than 1,000 pages of the EPBC Act. We're not going to see that legislation. Robyn Glindemann, Chair of the Australian Environment and Planning Law Group at the Law Council of Australia, said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If there is a potential for projects that are created to be used as offsets under the EPBC Act, then I query how we can make the two pieces of legislation work when we haven't seen the second bit. … the sequencing is of concern when the fundamental piece of legislation that the Commonwealth has is the EPBC Act … the benchmark for the Commonwealth to achieve its international obligations—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to turn to the Greens dissenting report. It's interesting to see what has been put on the table. At this point in time I'm not seeing any government or Greens amendments to this legislation. They may have been circulated while I've been on my feet, but as yet I'm not aware that they have been circulated. There was, of course, a motion moved yesterday, which I will come to in a moment, which is very nebulous in its construct. But the Greens talk about issues related to offsets. In fact, the dissenting report, signed by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, the deputy chair of this committee—who, as I understood, was firmly opposed to this bill—goes on about: offsets being a major concern; nationwide offsets earlier this year; concerns around how offsets have not been working for years; 'these goals will not be met with a scheme that facilitates further destruction'; and 'to give any credibility to a potential biodiversity accreditation scheme, the use of offsets must be explicitly excluded'. Well, we will see whether there is an amendment to that effect, because that's what the Greens were calling for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I might just turn to some closing comments from Senator Hanson-Young in one of the hearings in the inquiry into this bill, where Senator Hanson-Young says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every expert we've had today, and the exact report that the minister has used to promote this policy—by PwC of all people!—suggests otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">You can't point to any evidence that says this is going to be net positive. In fact, what does 'net positive' even mean when you're talking about biodiversity? It is clear that this bill is in absolute tatters. It has no friends. Even the people the minister had thought would back it have not backed it in. It's in tatters. I can see the looks on your faces—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It must be totally demoralising to have put in all this effort and then to have it put up in lights, given some scrutiny and be shown to be an absolute sham.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet I have this sneaking suspicion that the Australian Greens are going to support this bill. For what? We don't know. What we have thus far is a motion relating to some further amendments to be made, extraneous to the bill, around the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the EPBC Act, which is under reform and under review at the moment, which we haven't seen. These amendments will expand the circumstances in which certain petroleum mining developments must be assessed and approved by the minister administering the act. They're very nebulous—certain projects, unspecified at this point in time—and give us no clarity as to what backroom deal has been done between the Australian Greens political party and the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how have we got there? What does it mean? The Greens have been able to secure, clearly, something they didn't ask for or expressed concern about during the committee process, during interrogation of the legislation that was before us, but, as far as I can tell today, nothing relating to what they actually did express concern about with regard to offsets. Now, that may change. As I say, here we are debating the legislation and I've not seen any further amendments; they might be running around the chamber here somewhere, but I've not yet got them. I've got amendments from Senator Thorpe and Senator Pocock, which I look forward to debating at a point in time. They've clearly stuck to their guns and seen what needed to be fixed. But, as for the Greens, I can't actually see where they're going with this. It's an interesting arrangement, isn't it? In the last week of parliament, a bill that had absolutely no support in this place has been rushed in, on the basis that they somehow thought they were going to get it through. I was in disbelief at the government's attempts to do this. I thought the Australian Greens political party would—with their virtue always on display—stick to their guns. You heard yourself what Senator Hanson-Young, the deputy chair of the committee, said, in reflecting on this legislation as it stood.</span>

But, clearly, a deal has been done. We don't know the price yet. We don't know what they've secured. We don't know what smoke-filled room they were sitting in when they hatched this plan.

                    </a>  And I actually will take that interjection from Senator Thorpe. It was: 'They sold out.' Senator Thorpe and I may not agree on a range of issues; I will openly admit that here, and I don't think that would surprise many people. But, Senator Thorpe, on this occasion I stand shoulder to shoulder with you, because the Australian Greens political party have done what they do so often, and that is to sell out: 'Virtue, virtue, virtue, virtue;' sell out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there'll be good reason for it; don't worry. We'll hear the contributions soon, from the Australian Greens political party, about why they've sold out; why they spoke so strongly in the Senate committee hearing around this legislation; why it was bad; why the government was doing terrible things and was going to allow greenwashing. I wonder if those concerns around greenwashing exist today, or whether we are going to hear anything on them in the contributions from the Australian Greens political party. And I like saying 'Greens political party', because they are politicians who get elected to this place. They actually do things like hatch little deals with the Australian Labor Party to get legislation through, which, once upon a time—only less than a week ago—they were dead against. They are not beyond reproach. They are not the paragons of virtue they say they are. They are deal-makers. They'll do whatever they want, and they'll tell people out there in the community that they've done something good—something else. But if you go back and have a look at the history of this bill, if you go back and have a look at exactly what those opposite said was wrong with it—they had concerns about the lack of integrity in the process, concerns around greenwashing—no assurances have been given. As far as I can tell at this stage, debate already having commenced, there are no amendments from the government or the Greens, no assurances around integrity—probably not a concern to them—no assurances around offsets, some other nebulas deal we have no detail on at all and a committee process truncated by four months to rush this bill through. The Australian Greens political party—dealmakers extraordinaire—have done it again. As Senator Thorpe said, and I hope she says it several times in her contribution, they sold out. That is exactly what they have done and Australians need to know it. There will be less certainty than there was in the first draft of this bill. It is amendment city and it is going to be a disaster.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I rise to speak to the Nature Repair Market Bill. The process for the consideration of this bill could not be more flawed. It was not supposed to take place until at least April next year when the committee report was to be tabled. However, in a last-minute move, the government yesterday brought forward the committee report tabling and then passed a motion to consider this bill at the 11th hour. This means this was surely an intended move to pass a deeply flawed bill without scrutiny. The Senate was not prepared for the consideration of this bill, and many of the senators here had to scramble to get amendments done to pursue drafting. The drafters were so overwhelmed that the drafters were actually coming back to us and said, 'We can't do your amendments in time; we just don't have the time.' In most cases, our requests were met with an answer from the drafters basically that they couldn't keep up with the load because of what the government has done to this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is convenient for Labor to push through a bill which they, in the committee report, recommended should pass without amendments, managing to completely ignore the evidence provided in the process. There is absolutely no need to rush this bill regardless of what dirty deals you are doing. The government wants to pride itself on being the international frontrunner in establishing a nature repair market; however, there being no precedent for this at all, it should be approached in a very considered way. One of these considerations should be the nature repair market's interaction with other nature-positive reforms and the planned EPBC Act reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A large number of submitters to the inquiry made it very clear that the government's sequencing is all wrong and that the EPBC reforms need to come first. Therefore, I foreshadow my second reading amendment to postpone consideration of the bill until the EPBC bills have been considered by parliament next year. The EPBC reforms include the setting of legally enforceable national standards for matters of national environmental significance, which would set an important framework for the nature repair market to operate in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, they would establish a federal environmental protection authority which would be a more appropriate regulatory body with relevant expertise for compliance and enforcement of the nature repair market rather than the Clean Energy Regulator. The Chubb review, the independent review of Australian carbon credit units, found that the brief of the Clean Energy Regulator should be simplified and its role clarified yet this bill would add to the challenges and make the CER responsible for achieving both biodiversity outcomes and the creation and operation of a certificate trading market, which is different from the carbon trading market. While the CER has neither the expertise nor the resources to fulfil these obligations, we cannot pass this legislation without the EPA being established and, indeed, all of the EPBC reforms being in place first. Indeed, this bill should not be passed without removing the possibility of national biodiversity certificates being used for environmental offsetting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a core concern raised by pretty much all environmental and other stakeholders in the process—including the Greens' mates and the people who are meant to provide advice to the Greens, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Marine Conservation Society, WWF, the Wilderness Society and the Law Council of Australia to name just a few—as well as in hundreds of campaign emails received by the committee. Unfortunately, as you know, my drafting request to remove the Biodiversity Offsets Scheme components of this bill could not be met by the drafters due to the time constraints they found themselves in and the many short notice requests coming from all sides of the political divide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other amendments I wanted to put to the Senate today centred around respecting First Peoples' knowledge—which the Greens obviously sold out on again—and ensuring that our rights as traditional custodians of the lands and waters are being respected. I could not propose the following amendments due to Labor's failure of accountability and the Greens' dirty deal that cut out First Nations, so I'll start with my amendments that the drafters didn't have time to do. First there is the inclusion of a requirement to consult with First Peoples on proposed methodology determinations or biodiversity assessment instruments. Next is the inclusion of a requirement for the Commonwealth to consider First Peoples' traditional knowledge, perspective and cultural practices—those things you all talked about in your 'yes' campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another amendment concerned managing diversity while ensuring that the intellectual property of this knowledge is respected—you don't want to know about that, do you, Labor or Greens? Then there is the inclusion of a requirement for the provisions of the nature repair market to be in accordance with international instruments: the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Well, thanks, Labor and the Greens coalition! Another related to a requirement to develop safeguards to protect against harm and destruction to First Peoples' cultural heritage, including following the process of free, prior and informed consent of affected traditional owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You spent $250 million on a referendum that you shouldn't have had—and you'd been flagging for 12 months how great you were going to be and how much First Nations needed justice and needed to determine their own destiny—but, when you come to the chamber to actually vote on this stuff, you've got your heads in the sand. You're behind the doors doing deals with the Greens to deny First Nations' rights in December 2023. Is it because you're still sad about the campaign? Seriously, when are you going to get over it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another thing that Labor and the Greens sold us out on: the recognition of the interests of registered First Nations claimants under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 in the Northern Territory and the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 in New South Wales as eligible interests where their claim has not yet been determined. So you're just riding roughshod over First Nations' rights to get this bill done and dusted. Where's the self-determination in that? Once again, our rights as First Peoples have not been properly considered in a Labor bill that will significantly impact our people. Once again, we have not been properly consulted, despite this legislation concerning our land and despite First Peoples worldwide being at the forefront of biodiversity protection. The International Institute for Sustainable Development reported last year that lands inhabited by First Peoples contain 80 per cent of the world's remaining biodiversity and highlighted that first peoples' traditional knowledge—that you talked about in your Yes campaign—and knowledge systems are key to designing a sustainable future for everyone in this country. It's not for just us; it's for everybody.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental organisations fear that biodiversity and climate outcomes might actually be worse if this bill is passed as it is. Shame! This bill is a stark example of the government rushing through ill-considered legislation and doing dirty deals, with significant impacts on country, people and the climate. This is why I cannot support the bill as it is before us today, and it's why I think the Labor and the Greens coalition is gammon. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Omit all words after "That", substitute "further consideration of the bills be postponed until 1 July 2024 to enable them to be considered alongside the further bills the Government intends to introduce to implement its response to the second independent review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, led by Professor Graeme Samuel AC".</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GROGAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. They aim to establish a world-first nature repair market in Australia. We'll just leave all the politics to one side for a minute and look at what we're trying to achieve here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills provide a legislative framework for a voluntary national market in biodiversity certificates to enable private investment in high-integrity projects to protect, manage and restore nature. The market will be open to all landholders, including farmers, First Nations people, conservation groups and business. It will enable project proponents to undertake projects that protect or enhance biodiversity on a range of land tenures, including aquatic environments. Project proponents will be able to apply to the Clean Energy Regulator for a unique biodiversity certificate that could then be sold to an interested person or market. The market would be strictly regulated to prevent greenwashing and to monitor progress towards specified environmental outcomes. It is framework legislation, with significant elements of the scheme to be provided in a series of legislative instruments to be made by the minister, including rules, biodiversity assessment instruments and methodology determinations. Those legal instruments will be the subject of consultation. That process will be done in line with the review that is currently underway of our EPBC legislation so that they stand hand in hand. The Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023 would make minor amendments to the Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 to facilitate the establishment, operation and regulation of the nature repair market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did we get here? What was the catalyst for this? It was the fact that we've seen our environment decline significantly and the fact that we've seen the state of the environment reports show declines for a number of years now. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">state of the environment </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2021</span> report was a serious wake-up call. The devastating results that came out of that report sent out shockwaves, but nothing was done. That report found that significant investment is needed to reverse the decline in the areas of conservation and restoration. Part of reversing that decline is to create a very clear and regulated pathway for all avenues to be explored to restore our natural environment. That means bringing in businesses, philanthropists, environmental groups, First Nations people. It's about bringing everyone into this space and creating an environment where we can work together to protect our nature. The Samuel review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act also suggested that attracting private sector investment would be crucial and that a regulated nature repair market would encourage voluntary investment from the private sector towards the task of restoring Australia's natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Duniam has told us that this bill has no friends, so I'll give you a quote from the National Farmers Federation, friends of Senator Duniam's. They said that they were delighted. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Linking farmers with investors who will partner with them to invest in environmental protection is a significant step forward in how we protect and care for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a very wise comment. There are a range of people who support the idea of a nature repair market, and that is evidenced in the 105 submissions that are on the website for the committee's inquiry and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> from those hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to these bills being introduced in the parliament, they were subject to two rounds of public consultation that further informed the development of the market framework. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water noted that as part of this public consultation they conducted over 60 engagement events, including sessions focused on Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders, public information sessions and targeted meetings with individuals, organisations and Commonwealth and state and territory representatives. A request for submissions resulted in over 180 written responses to the department. So there has been quite a lot of consultation and a lot of transparency and scrutiny, contrary to the claim of Senator Duniam, who says there has been none.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 March 2023 the Senate referred the provisions of these bills to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry. As I've said, we received 105 submissions. We got responses from individuals, environmental organisations, peak bodies, businesses, various interested groups and associations. The committee held two public hearings in Canberra, on 30 June and 11 September 2023. Overall, there was strong support from submitters for the intent of these bills: to give effect to a market based mechanism to enable people to engage in improving our environment and to do so while being able to engage in a financial market and a biodiversity market. Key areas of interest for the people who submitted included offsets, market design, integrity, governance, broader environmental reform, market operations and the role of First Nations. Throughout the submissions, the general support for the market remained strong. Despite some concerns about particular elements, there was a general thrust that people thought this idea was a good one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I seem to remember that, when the bills were first introduced into the lower house, there was a lot of positive commentary coming from the Nationals, particularly from Mr Littleproud. He said that the bill is 'basically verbatim our legislation'. So this is legislation that the Nationals had drafted and, in the words of the Nationals, it's very much the same. He went on to say that he was 'proud of the fact that it's stood the test of time—of a changing government'. That seems quite supportive, I think, at the point in time when this legislation was introduced, in March 2023. But I suppose it's more about playing politics, isn't it? It's not about sticking to the idea that we would protect our natural environment, that we would enable landholders to engage in this as another stream of income, that we would enable First Nations people to engage in this market or that we would enable people to go out and protect our environment and find some level of recompense for that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had the Nature Conservancy supporting the bills. They said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We welcome the creation of a Nature Repair Market and its applicability to all landholders. Overall, TNC is supportive of the need to incentivise and reward landholders for the protection, good management and restoration of native vegetation, threatened species habitat and other natural values. There is a role for governments in ensuring there is consistency, integrity and transparency and a baseload of demand, particularly in emerging market mechanisms …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for fun, let me quote the National Farmers Federation again:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NFF supports the proposed Nature Repair Market Bill and recognises the opportunities it will offer to farmers and landholders in contributing to ecosystem services and participating in a broader marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides a critical step towards achieving sustainable and resilient ecosystems in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That sounds very supportive, too, I would say. Other supportive stakeholders included Climate Friendly, the Indigenous Desert Alliance, the Kimberley Land Council, Farmers for Climate Action, the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute, the Property Council of Australia, the Australian Business Council of Australia and the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation. That's quite a lot of support, really.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, throughout the inquiry, the recognition of the role of Australia's First Nations people in caring for country was well articulated through the evidence. The New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council highlighted that local Aboriginal land councils possess specific traditional ecological knowledge and land management expertise accumulated over millennia. Why would we not enable those people to not just continue to care for the country that they have presided over for 65,000 years but provide opportunities to extend that, where land has been taken from them? We know this. We could enable them not just to start building a means of continuing to protect that land but to do it with an economic base and have an economic benefit from that. I know from a lot of the hearings that we've had—we hear this a lot—that that is what First Nations people want. They want an opportunity for an economic benefit, and I believe we should provide that.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who else have we got? Emeritus Professor Jon Altman pointed out that, due to the scale of First Nations landholdings across the country, the NRM bill would disproportionately impact First Nations people. Yes, it would. Wouldn't it be great if we could make that a positive impact? Professor Altman said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First Nations people are not just another landowning interest group alongside governments and private landowners and leaseholders … First Nations people will be the dominant players in any real or imagined 'nature repair' or 'biodiversity' market in Australia today because of their rights and interests in a majority part of the continent, much in remote and very remote Australia, that is relatively environmentally intact and so has relatively high biodiversity 'value'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That also sounds positive to me, as well. The department's submission outlined how, indeed, First Nations Australians can participate in the market:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… by undertaking projects that deliver biodiversity improvements or protect biodiversity on land which they hold through different types of tenure. This includes exclusive and non-exclusive Native Title, land rights, leasehold and freehold. First Nations people could also provide on-ground management services or advice to support nature repair projects managed by others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That sounds like a good stream.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that the claims on this bill that I've heard in this chamber so far don't seem to be supported by genuinely looking at the evidence and don't seem to be supported by looking at those 105 submissions or the 180 submissions that the department received when they did their consultation prior to the bills. It doesn't seem to stack up. Were there concerns raised about certain elements of the bills? Yes—but that's the point, isn't it? That's the whole point of having the inquiries. That's the whole point of having the committees: so you can refine, improve and identify where the challenges are and do something about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were several crossbench initiated amendments agreed to by the House of Reps, and, as we've heard, there'll be other amendments being brought forward from various senators today. We will debate those in the committee stage of this process. It is in the view of the committee, in its printed report, that following the passage of the legislation there will be a lengthy period of design of methodologies that will underpin this repair market. We're confident that that will be a great process to develop what will be a world first and, I think, a fundamentally changed position for our country and for our natural environment: to protect nature.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I'm very pleased to participate in this debate on this very important bill, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. As Senator Grogan correctly identified, the intention of this bill was first proposed by the Liberals and Nationals in government. We were absolutely not opposed in principle to the creation of a biodiversity market, and we actually pioneered work in this very important area of policy in Australia. We undertook comprehensive work, including a significant level of stakeholder consultation and engagement, on creating a voluntary national market in biodiversity certificates. We worked extensively with the Australian National University to actually develop a world-first accreditation scheme for biodiversity credits. But this bill, the bill that is now before us today, and its related amendments are not as we proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has all the hallmarks of the pig-headed ignorance of this government that they continue to demonstrate through how they go forward and implement. Their lack of consultation and their ability to take a good idea and absolutely destroy it are becoming a standard mode of operation by this government. We saw it last week with the passage of the restoring our rivers amendments through this place, and we see it again today. Another key hallmark of the way they operate is their claims of consultation: 'We've put something online. The department accepts submissions. We got 180 submissions; look how well we've consulted. We've held a Senate inquiry. We took written submissions. We held two public hearings.' Where were those public hearings? This government is almost allergic to holding public hearings outside of Canberra, because where were the two public hearings for this bill that impacts rural and regional Australians more so than anyone else held? Here in Canberra; what a surprise!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: the original purpose of the bill that the coalition presented was to create the biodiversity credits along similar lines—robust and measurable credits through our work with the ANU—to the energy-generating credits which would allow a landholder to obtain tradeable certificates that could be used in a similar way to carbon offsets. The bill we are presented with today is far more complex, is less understood and creates unknown risks. Senator Grogan just said it herself: 'There is still so much work to be done on the design and methodologies.' It's typical of this government with their 'trust us' approach: 'Trust us; she'll be right. We'll work out the actual implementation phase later.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the risks that this bill presents is the decision to extend the parameters of the market. The bill presented by the coalition was limited to agricultural land, but Labor's bill goes far wider and proposes to include all types of land tenure, including territorial waters, regardless of ownership or legal right. It includes all native title land, all Crown land and all Torrens system land titles. This means that the agriculture, mining, resources, forestry and fishing sectors could possibly all be forced for economic reasons to take up biodiversity credits which are of no overall benefit to the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition did a considerable amount of work on our legislation, particularly with the ANU. It was based strictly on the application to potential projects and the specialised carbon and biodiversity and enhancing remnant vegetation assessment models. But Labor has veered away from that robust methodology. They're proposing to employ a very different way of legislating and regulating, by allowing potential participants in the market to define and apply their own idiosyncratic methodologies to the projects. This just adds to the confusion, the unknown implications and the limits of this legislation. 'But trust us.' they say. It's also not clear how Labor's work on new arrangements for offsets as part of the changes to the EPBC Act will interact with this legislation. There are a lot of unknowns here, which brings into question: what deal have they done with the Greens in order to bring forward this legislation and cut short their own request for an extension to the committee process?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to what Greens spokeswoman, Senator Hanson-Young, said on Sunday. When asked about this legislation on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span>, Senator Hanson-Young said: 'The idea of allowing the protection of one part of nature, a particular area of koala habitat, to be saved, in order to justify the destruction of nature somewhere else—I mean, that's bonkers. That's not environmental protection.' She went on to say: 'That's a red line for us. I want to see the offsets gone. If the offsets go, then I'm happy to sit down with the government and talk about where we go next.' If that was the position of the Greens on Sunday, given that we have not seen such amendments circulated as yet today, what deal has been done? What have the Greens traded off in order to bring forward this legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are grave concerns about offsets right through our communities. I have to quote my colleague from the other place, the member for Flynn, Colin Boyce, when he spoke on this bill. He had such a turn of phrase when talking about offsets:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The wealthy virtue-signalling elite want to invest billions of dollars in Australian agricultural land, lock it up and forget about it to appease their own self-loathing of their irresponsible lifestyles while they continue their jet-setting, latte-sipping affluence …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is such an accurate description of the approach to offsets that is taken by sections of corporate Australia. Given this government's track record in the environment space and the lack of understanding by the minister of so much of what she's been pushing through this place, I would have thought it better governance to wait and allow the Senate committee to complete its work, as per the government's own request for an extension until April. Then they could've taken the time to consider all the implications of what is being proposed and come back to this place for a sensible and informed debate, as recommended by my colleague Senator Thorpe, who supported the full completion of the Senate inquiry and the full and informed consideration of this bill. That responsible approach is clearly not one favoured by the Greens or Labor. It's not one they want to see, so they're pushing through the bills, which few understand and even they haven't finalised. They haven't worked out how the bill will apply. The similarities and potentially disastrous consequences of this bill remind me of last week's debate on water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to be clear here: it was the government that requested the extension of the reporting time lines of the Senate committee and proposed April next year. How disingenuous! We were happy to support it because we believed that this bill needed thorough investigation and needed to hear from all stakeholders. We would've supported the committee going out into regional areas to hear from stakeholders. But, no, the government only wanted to hear evidence here in Canberra. We would've supported that, but what we are now finding out is that the government just wanted more time to negotiate a dodgy deal with the Greens. We have no idea what the deal is or what it means and we are still waiting to see what it is. What 30 pieces of silver have been traded off today with this legislation? It's unfortunate that yet again in this place we find ourselves, as senators, unable to do our duty of scrutinising and testing the legislation comprehensively through the committee process. We are unable to listen to affected community groups and stakeholders, unable to go out on ground and talk to people on ground and hear their concerns and their evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the now curtailed work of the Senate legislation committee on this bill, there was frequent evidence from stakeholders about and frequent reference from stakeholders to concerns about this bill and its intended impacts, particularly concerns about offsets. There were concerns about putting this bill up before the proposed changes to the EPBC Act, and Senator Thorpe referenced that earlier. We've heard at length from this government of their desires and of their review of the EPBC Act and of the fact that they want to establish an environmental protection authority at a federal level, which raises all sorts of concerns. It flies in the face of less government and smaller government and creates concerns about duplication, but they want to put this bill up first. How is it going to interact with any proposed new authority? What will the governance arrangements be? But trust us; we'll get there!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand, and I take Senator Grogan's point, that the NFF has made some welcoming noises about the bill and about the intention of the bill. As I said, from the outset we supported the intention of the bill, but in the way this bill is drafted it has far too many red flags, far too many concerns and certainly not enough clarity about how it actually will be implemented, how it will operate and how robust the assessment and accreditation scheme will be. As I said before, despite the very good work the coalition did with the ANU and the robust, world-leading accreditation proposal that we had put forward, Labor have gone off on their own track: 'We know better. We just don't know how we know better, because we haven't got there yet. There's still work to be done on design and methodology, and we'll duck-shove that to delegated legislation. Trust us—it'll all be okay.' Well, I can tell you regional Australia doesn't trust this government, agricultural industries don't trust this government, the mining sector doesn't trust this government and I don't think the Senate should trust this government. I do not think we should be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  A nature repair market sounds positive but, without the right settings and safeguards, I fear that at best it may do very little good and at worst it will facilitate greenwashing on a grand scale. The first object of the bill before us, the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023, is to promote the enhancement and protection of biodiversity and native species in Australia. This is clearly a very worthy goal. In the words of EO Wilson:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There can be no purpose more inspiriting than to begin the age of restoration, reweaving the wondrous diversity of life that still surrounds us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are truly lucky to live on this continent, a megadiverse continent, but we know that we are failing nature. We have seen catastrophic declines in our lifetimes. In the last 40 years, there has been a decline in most bird species of 60-plus per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To change this, to change the fact that one of the wealthiest countries in the world can't find a few billion dollars to implement what our ecologists and environmental scientists are saying, takes cultural change. It takes leadership. It takes making the case for why we can and should do things differently and talking about the fact that we are heading in the wrong direction by somehow believing that we exist outside the bounds of nature and that nature is something out there. We are part of nature, and if nature goes down we are going down with her. We're starting to see the impacts of a mindset, a way of making decisions, that treats nature as something out there, something that's a nice-to-have, rather than as critical to our very survival and to our physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate here to have some of the world's leading environmental scientists, and they've got solutions. They are putting forward a path to deal with this, to truly turn things around. Clearly, that starts with stopping the destruction of habitat—things like native forest logging which are now costing taxpayers money. We're paying to cut down native forests that are home to threatened species. We clearly need to preserve habitat. We also need funding for threatened species programs, and we're just so far off the mark. A group of Australia's leading environmental scientists calculated that we need to spend about $2 billion a year to do that. Two billion dollars is a sizeable amount of money but, for a country like Australia, it's very affordable. In the last few weeks we've seen Snowy Hydro get another $6 billion for costs blowing out and there was an extra $10 billion for the frigates project. If this mattered to us, if this truly mattered to us, we would be able to fund it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government has committed to improving our nature laws, and this is long overdue—I welcome it. They need to be drafted and legislated in a way that actually protects nature and halts the catastrophic decline that we're witnessing. We also need to support better land management, including by this continent's First Peoples. We have commitments from the government to double the Indigenous Rangers Program this decade, but we also need to ensure that First Nations' knowledge is implemented and that First Nations people are actually allowed to manage the land. I hear too often from ranger groups, including here in the ACT, that they're sometimes viewed as a box-ticking exercise, 'Yes, we'll do cultural burning and all these sorts of things, but only if it fits in with our pre-existing approvals and bureaucratic way of managing land.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill looks to create a market for biodiversity. There's clearly a range of issues here, starting with dealing with something that's not that fungible—it's hard to measure. But I'm also concerned whether this is something that shouldn't or couldn't happen until we're actually doing the fundamentals well—when we're taking care of nature and looking for additional money for the environment. That's not the case here in Australia. It's not the case; we've been underfunding it for decades. We have bold promises around no new extinctions, but we're not seeing those backed up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, this is not a new issue which humans have been grappling with. Almost 100 years ago Aldo Leopold wrote what was later published in <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ound River</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Considering the prodigious achievements of the profit motive in wrecking land, one hesitates to reject it as a vehicle for restoring land. I incline to believe we have overestimated the scope of the profit motive. Is it profitable for the individual to build a beautiful home? To give his children a higher education? No, it is seldom profitable, yet we do both. These are, in fact, ethical and aesthetic premises which underlie the economic system. Once accepted, economic forces tend to align the smaller details of social organization into harmony with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The task of developing a land ethic here in Australia is critical—having a government that's willing to go out on a limb and say: 'We need to change the way we think about our place in nature. We need to think of land not as something that belongs to us but of us belonging to the land.' I fear that this legislation is the other way round: we're simply trying to use the existing system rather than acknowledge that it hasn't been working.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are some of my concerns with this bill? Firstly, it sets up the potential for future links to an offset market—to offset damage to the environment. We've seen the disastrous consequences of this; just look at the report on the scheme in New South Wales. It's not good! It seems to me that when you're left with a couple of per cent of temperate grasslands and box gum woodlands, it's incredibly hard to offset that. Where are you going to find that offset? There are just too many examples of offsetting gone bad. Take the Whitehaven Maules Creek coalmine. They ended up extending the offset period for a decade because they couldn't get the right offsets. Then they somehow managed to wangle their way to getting them accepted, but anyone who has seen some of those offsets will tell you that it's very hard to argue that they're like for like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'm concerned about some of the integrity provisions. This is set up in a way that's parallel to the Emissions Reduction Fund. It's managed by the Clean Energy Regulator, who specialise in managing carbon projects. We've seen the issues around the application of methodologies. I'm sure this will be up for debate in this place, but clearly it seems to me that there are integrity issues, and yet we're just going to give them a whole other body of work. It's very hard to say that carbon is similar to biodiversity in terms of managing it, coming up with methodologies, enforcing those methodologies, issuing credits. I have real concerns around that. Based on those concerns, I will be putting forward an amendment that would add third-party open standing provisions. These are standard provisions in many modern acts, including the EPBC Act. These would allow third parties to initiate enforcement proceedings to uphold the law and seek judicial review of administrative decisions. If the government are comfortable that the CER will do the job well, then I'm very hopeful that they will have no problem with third-party standing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly—and this goes back to my earlier point about the sequencing of this—there doesn't seem to be a clear pathway for government investment in biodiversity. We've seen $50 million here and $100 million there. It's very unclear if that's new money or if it's just coming from the trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the bill creates no role for First Nations peoples in the governance and integrity provisions of the nature repair market. This is a concern to me. I think there should be a requirement for a First Nations person on the committee, given that I'm hearing that a lot of this is aimed at Indigenous protected areas. Again, I will be putting forward an amendment on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, when we're talking about biodiversity, we can't not talk about climate change. Climate change is having a devastating impact on our biodiversity, from the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef to mass die-offs of spectacled flying foxes in Far North Queensland, to many of our very heat-sensitive species like gliders, which are in a lot of trouble when you look at habitat fragmentation and a warming climate. I would like the government to take that seriously. It's obviously not in this bill, but it very hard to talk about one without the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be moving a second reading amendment highlighting some of my recommendations for actions to get better outcomes from this bill. These include creating a government investment strategy, which is something that came up a lot in the roundtables I held on this bill when it was in front of, I think, the first Senate committee that looked at it. I believe that the government should give a firm commitment to and time line for implementing the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. If you're going to set up a market, you've actually got to ensure that you're creating some demand there by ensuring companies are disclosing their nature risk. It's been something that we've done in Australia for decades, where we've just externalised the cost of production, of extraction, onto nature. Nature has picked up the tab for too long. With TNFD, we now have a structure to be able to put that in a report, put it on a balance sheet and show how exposed companies in Australia are, and drive some change that way. The third thing called for in my second reading amendment is a review of the governance of the nature repair market, once the EPA is legislated and up and running, as to whether or not that is a more suitable place for the governance of a biodiversity credit market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see what the government is trying to do with this bill but, again, as such a wealthy country, we've got to start to fund biodiversity and threatened species, rather than not giving them funding but pointing to a market mechanism where there may be some demand but where, from all the consultation I've done, it's very unclear just how much demand there will be. On top of that, we don't have a firm commitment that the government will kickstart demand with funding for that, as they did with the carbon market.</span>

                    <a href="16913" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator AYRES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade and Assistant Minister for Manufacturing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  As is often the case, it's always a good thing to sit in this chamber and listen to the contributions of other  senators. In terms of Senator Pocock's last contribution, I think there is enormous scope for agreement on the fundamental questions that lie before us on the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 but also more broadly. He is right to point to all of the concerns that should mobilise this Senate, which are much broader than a narrowly constructed environmental one. They go to ethical, aesthetic, economic and legal questions that ought to mobilise our thinking. I want to come to those issues in substance. I also listened to the contributions by Senator Davey and Senator Grogan. They both pointed to the fact that the genesis of this framework lay in the three previous terms of coalition government, and Mr Littleproud was an early advocate for this kind of framework. In the previous nine years of coalition government, this was viewed as a good idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the whole answer to the biodiversity challenge, and it's wrong to identify one measure and insist that that one measure cover the field of what is required in this area of policy. There are other things that must be attended to. It is just one of the tools. Reservation of marine and terrestrial environments is one of the tools that the government has. Getting the approvals process right so the EPBC Act meets the public policy grounds upon which it should properly be founded is one of the tools. Support for good practice from the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the states, is one of the tools that should be employed when protecting biodiversity. I single out Indigenous ranger programs and what might be contemplated in terms of extending that important work to country towns and, yes, to First Nations communities but also broadening the scope of that kind of caring for country work, which is of enormous benefit to protecting biodiversity. The range of programs that the Commonwealth funds, some of it in cooperation with the states, is another vector of activity, as is supporting our science and research communities and making sure that our science and research programs meet the biodiversity challenge as well as the other big challenges that they are required to meet. All of these are vectors for activity. This is just one program or one legislated measure that should assist. I want to come to the substance of that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The position of the coalition is, of course, what's interesting here. They say this was their idea, but they didn't legislate it. It reminds me of Saint Augustine's prayer: 'Lord, make me pure, but just not quite yet.' They say, 'We were going to do it, but we just didn't.' They extend that incapacity for action to: 'We were going to do it. We didn't. Now you're doing it, we're bitterly opposed to it. ' That is why nothing happened over the course of the last nine years, not just in this important area of reform but also in others. They, in government, didn't want anything to happen then, and they don't want anything to happen now. If we followed Mr Dutton and the coalition's prescription, there would be no progress. Nothing would ever get done. That is the case of so many areas of public policy reforms that are necessary for the country and in the national interest: climate, housing, energy policy, industrial policy, Australia's place in the region, and our environmental objectives more broadly. The coalition were determined to achieve no progress then, and, even in areas where they talked a good game in government but delivered nothing, they are determined that their successes in government should not proceed with any reform at all. It's a confluence of ineptitude in government with a backward-looking culture-wars bigotry against reform and action, a bias for inaction, an easy recourse to saying no, a determination to plumb the depths of public debate on these questions, and a refusal to accept, whether it's founded on a sense of entitlement or not, that anybody but them could form a proper government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, in this area of world-leading reform, we are determined to get on with it. We are a government that will work across the chamber to deliver this package of legislation. It is world-leading. It will, in my view, require administrative action and adjustment over time as we make sure that this works effectively. In the end, what will it do? It will provide, particularly for our agriculture sector, a set of incentives to encourage actions that support biodiversity on farms, on leaseholds and on native title land. We will do it collectively with the agriculture sector. We will work with farmers to deliver these kinds of projects. I know from my own background that, on almost every farm in the country, there is land that is productive and there is what we used to call scrub country that is unproductive. This legislation would give most farmers a more diverse income base and a capacity to use the land, which was not productive land before, in a way that's in the public interest and that will improve the quality of their property and, over time, improve the public good that their private holdings can support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Will it achieve all of the objectives that we need to achieve in reform in terms of biodiversity? Absolutely not. It does not claim to do that. All of the issues that Senator Pocock went to require attention. But, in this area of reform, this will represent significant progress and a way of engaging the private sector and privately held land in a constructive way in biodiversity efforts. Consider the natural diversity of the Australian continent at colonisation. And consider what it was when the original occupants of this country had it in their hands. Consider the diversity of the continent at colonisation. Consider what it looked like then. Consider it a hundred or so years ago. Consider the impact that economic and agricultural development and industrial development have had on the landscape, on habitat and on species diversity. Think about biodiversity as we were growing up. For me, it was on farms and in country towns in northern New South Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. Think about the access to biodiversity that we had around our farms and our properties, and then have a look at what it is now. There is a retreat measured not just in terms of species extinction, the reduction of habitat and the reduction of infrastructure that is critical for nature—such as streams, creeks, rivers and billabongs that support species diversity—but also in terms of the access our kids have to experiences in nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has more than an economic dimension. I think that's what Senator Pocock was talking about: the cultural and aesthetic issues that are fundamental. This government is determined to take action in the areas that I pointed to, including by means of this bill, because, if that trajectory just continues uninterrupted, the experience of our kids, our grandkids and our greatgrandchildren will continue to be constrained and to diminish. Aside from all of the economic, agricultural and environmental questions that the scientific community might point us to—where areas like the Murray-Darling system reach a tipping point and where the drivers of habitat reduction mean that you reach a tipping point in biodiversity terms—actually, there are national identity, cultural and aesthetic community questions in terms of maintaining species diversity that are critical. This bill is just another measure of us saying that strengthening the national estate here is government's core responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does mean that, on private land, there will be stronger incentives for property owners to take action. I was recently on a relative's property near Hillston, with my son that was founded under the old Soldier Settlement Scheme. The family built a remarkable sheep and grain property. There are native grasses all over it. One of the things that that family has done—and it's often a thing that farmers do as they get a bit older and when they've been on that land for a long time and know that country really well—is identify areas for natural development. In that old cypress pine country that used to exist there, they have found some sections of that farm and, at their own expense, done a remarkable job of replanting the original vegetation. The species diversity that they have been able to re-establish in that bit of country is remarkable. In fact, it's very interesting. I could bore you for hours, but I only have a minute to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The First Nations artefacts that they have discovered there and worked with local land councils and others to make sure they are protected and maintained in that country—let's find a way of the whole country doing this work. Let's find a way of engaging and providing incentives so it's not just a matter of charity or a sense of what is in the interests of future generations that mobilises it but a set of economic incentives that support that kind of development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is part of the way forward here. I stress that it's not the only measure that the government is undertaking. Minister Plibersek, as Minister for the Environment and Water, and the other ministers in the government who are engaged in this work, will continue to outline and deliver areas of reform. I look forward to the amendments and to working across the chamber to make sure that this piece of legislation is passed. I hope that we will continue to watch its progress closely and make sure it delivers in the national interest in the way that it should.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  I'm totally opposed to the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 because I'm against these artificial, corrupt, government-imposed markets which do nothing to help the real world but end up making a whole lot of people money. In effect, what we have in front of us here is a modern form of indulgence. We had these old indulgences in the old days, where if you sinned and you did the wrong thing, you could go the Pope or the Catholic Church and pay some money and you'd be absolved and could go to heaven. Now, we have a new form of indulgence where you commit some sin against the Green gods and you pay a price—an offset, it's called—and I suppose you go to wherever the Greens go when they pass from this world. You still get to heaven. That's what this is all about and that's what these bills do. It says that you can destroy the environment a little bit—that's okay, as long as you do something over here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What inevitably happens is these markets tend to be totally corrupt. They don't work, and I'll go through some examples of that. They don't even generate anything for the real world. At least, as much as the Catholic Church has sinned over the years, at least the old form of indulgence has got us St Peter's. We got Saint Peter's Basilica out of it, and that's pretty impressive. I was lucky enough to go this year, and it's pretty impressive. There was at least some corresponding benefit of the corruption that involved the medieval form of indulgences. We'll get nothing from these bills. This will do nothing for the environment. It just sets a whole new level of bureaucracy, which is what this town loves. That's why the Labor Party are for it and that's why all the trade unions are for it. They love it—more jobs, more bureaucrats assessing artificial things that will never generate any real-world improvements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens with the situations is a bunch of big companies decide that they want to burnish their green credentials—you've probably seen it yourselves if you've ever flown recently. You will see those little boxes that say you can tick here, pay a little extra money and you can be green. You can offset the evil thing you are doing by flying from one place to another by paying a little bit extra on these green offsets. That's what these bills try to encourage and grow. What do these offsets do? There was a recent big international study of these offsets, used around the world by companies like Shell and even Gucci—all of these companies that like to tell us all how moral and ethical they really are. This study found that 94 per cent of these carbon offsets—run by this company called Verra, and all this company does is environment offsets—did nothing. They did nothing for the environment. They didn't change any deforestation at all but they were still sold for money. You still paid for them when you ticked the boxes or decided to get green power or whatever you decided to do it. Fair enough, if you want to do that and spend money on that, that's fine. But it's not fine when that money you are spending does not go towards an actual benefit. That happened in 94 per cent of these cases. In fact, one of these offset programs is in the Brazilian Amazon, and an auditor who worked in a lot of projects in the Amazon was quoted in the study, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have worked as an auditor on these projects in the Brazilian Amazon and when I started this analysis, I wanted to know if we could trust their predictions about deforestation. The evidence from the analysis—not just the synthetic controls—suggests we cannot. I want this system to work to protect rainforests. For that to happen, we need to acknowledge the scale of problems with the current system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what is happening right now, and these bills do nothing to improve the auditing of practices that occur in this processes. In fact, I think these types of systems are fundamentally broken. You're never going to create an artificial environment that will work, because bureaucrats will never get this right. They will never do this right. There will always be this level of corruption. This is not the way things should go down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other aspect here that gets forgotten is that when these offsets do anything, if they do, it's not usually to protect the environment; it is to shut down economic production. That's what happens. We'll say we're going to protect this mulga country—this is a real example happening right now—in South-West Queensland. We'll say: 'Just take all the cattle off the property, and that will become a carbon offset, because cattle are terrible and woeful and do bad things. You take all the cattle off, and we'll designate that area now, without cattle, as being environmentally pure.' You can generate an offset and sell that through this carbon market, sometimes the biodiversity market, et cetera. That happens right now without these bills. It's happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the previous speaker, Senator Ayres, saying it's great for farmers. Okay; the guy who sells it, the guy who owns the land, yes, gets some money. He gets paid some money for that. Good luck to him. Nothing much happens except that the cattle leave. Weeds grow, pests grow. No-one manages the property anymore. It's worse for the local environment. And the unspoken victims of that are economic—the small businesses, the people and the workers who live in that area. If there are no cattle anymore in that area in South-West Queensland, there are no fencing contractors, there are no mustering teams to muster the cattle and there's no longer any need for helicopter pilots to help muster. Truck drivers have less business. Fewer people are coming out to motels. A whole country town is then affected by this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the Cunnamulla mayor just a few months ago about this. There are now long roads in her council area where all cattle have been completely removed. In one part, eight of 13 cattle properties down one road have no cattle anymore because big rich investors from these big companies have come in and bought out all the cattle. They've bought out the economic base of these country towns and communities. As I say, it does nothing for the environment. You just get weeds and pests growing. It's great for all the wild dogs and pigs. They have a great old time because no-one is there managing the property anymore, but nothing is done for the real environment except real people are hurt.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another example, not a farming example. Some other people have come to me in recent years about a situation here, around the ACT. There's a large suburban community near the ACT called Jerrabomberra. It is growing rapidly, and there's a need for a new road out to this new suburb because the current roads are getting very congested. That road was set and designed to go through a certain area, a rural area. It wasn't going to impact anyone's homes or anything like that. But then, it turned out, the New South Wales government discovered that part of the road reserve that they had identified went through an area that had been offset against someone else's project. It was a mining or manufacturing project or something. Some other project had bought this area of land and said 'Nothing can ever happen on this land anymore,' for however many years—these bills say 25 to 100 years or something like that. So they couldn't build the road through this offset area. I've asked questions here at estimates, and apparently once something is offset like that it's done. It's set in stone. You can't offset the offset, and you're stuck. They've had to redesign where this road is going out to Jerrabomberra, and guess what? They've put the road through people's homes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have a situation with these stupid offsets where you're protecting some scrub outside of the ACT and saying it's wonderful for the environment. You can't cut down those trees. You could have cut down all the trees leading up to that offset area and the ones beyond that; that's fine. This little area, this little pocket, is inviolable now and can't be touched. So we'll just move the road and we'll knock out people's homes. We're going to displace human beings, who are living here, who have built their lives, some of whom would have built their forever homes here. Bang—don't worry about you; we're not going to worry about you anymore. This is ridiculous. These offset regimes cost people in real terms, and they do nothing to protect the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought Senator Pocock made a very good point before, too, that if we want to protect the environment, why isn't the government paying for it, if it's a social good? I think we should have government funded environmental protection projects and biodiversity projects. We should do these things. The former coalition government established the Green Army, which did great, practical things at a local level to improve the environment—not these grand schemes but getting down into the environment, removing weeds, getting rid of pests and cleaning up rivers and bank channels to help your local environment. Those things are really important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reason we've got this type of scheme coming before us is that the government is broke; they've got no money, and they want the rest of us to pay for it. That's what's happening here. This is a scheme that's being set up so companies can put more and more surcharges on your airfares and at your shops, to say that they're green without doing anything and cost you more money. That's what's going to happen here. It happens all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see it at the shops right now; it's a little bit different from this, but it's scratching the same itch. Has anyone noticed how, when you go into Coles and Woolworths now, you pay 25c for these ridiculous paper bags? They say they're good for the environment. My mum was telling me the other day that when they introduced plastic bags a generation ago they made a big song and dance about how that was protecting the environment, because they were getting rid of paper bags, which meant chopping down the trees. Now they're making the same claims about these paper bags, which break and don't last. Do you know what it is? It's a money-making scheme, because they're 25c, they break every bloody time, and you've got to get another one when you go back. Coles and Woolworths are just making more money from this—saying that they're green and they're environmental. This is just a way of making you pay more, and they're hoping you'll feel good about it because it's green and environmental. That's what this is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear constantly from this government that their No. 1 priority is the cost of living. We hear that from the Prime Minister, and we've heard it from them this week in question time. Their No. 1 priority is the cost of living. Where are the bills this week that deal with the cost of living? Has anyone noticed any piece of legislation coming forward to this chamber this week that's actually going to lower the cost of living for Australians? I haven't. I haven't seen a single one. They say it's the No. 1 priority, but all we get are more and more bills that add costs onto people, that add red tape, that add regulation and that increase people's costs of basic life here, and that's what this bill will do. It's setting up a regime which will either force, make or pressure companies to buy these indulgences, these environmental offsets that will cost them money. And then they have to pass on those costs to all of you, in your shopping bills, in your power bills, in your mortgages—because the banks are big in this, too; the banks love all this stuff—in your interest rates. All these things will go up because of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why isn't a government that says they're in favour of doing something about the cost of living actually doing something to help? Why aren't they doing something to help our nation's farmers increase their productivity? They could still protect the environment but also increase food production. Why have they got a bill before us that shuts down agricultural production across our country, which reduces and makes it harder for farmers to produce goods and help to bring down the costs of food in your shops? We saw during the last week we were here the government forcing through legislation to rip water out of the Murray-Darling Basin, our nation's food bowl. There's now going to be much less water used in the Murray-Darling, because this government is obsessed. They did another deal with the Greens last week to take water off farmers. And if you have less water you grow less food, and that's going to increase the costs of food production—another bill that increased the cost of living for Australians. It's a constant theme here, from a government that seems committed to not doing anything without the support of the radical Greens political party, which has no interest in bringing down costs for consumers but simply wants to end intensive agriculture in this country, de-industrialise our nation and make us weaker and poorer because of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this agenda is all about. We'll hear from other senators about how David Littleproud supported this. Well, I don't support it. Deal with the arguments. You're constantly wanting to resort to personal attacks and play politics with these sorts of things. Drop the politics. Tell us how this will actually help bring people's cost of living down, because that's what you say is your No. 1 priority. So, tell us, in very simple terms, how this bill is going to help Australians. That should be what we're here for. That should be why we decide to spend time away from our families and come to this place. How is this bill actually going to help the lives of real Australians? It's not. This is a bill that's all for big business. It's a bill for the big businesses of the world who want to assuage their moral guilt for other things and ways they might conduct themselves by buying these indulgences. That's what this bill is about. It's to help big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's certainly not to help small businesses. Small businesses aren't there buying these environmental offsets. They don't care about these things. They're too busy running their own businesses, trying to keep their payroll in check, trying to deal with the red tape in the ATO and all the other things that oppress their lives. They don't care about this stuff. It's not for small businesses. It's certainly not for families who are struggling to pay their kids' school fees, to keep them in sports at ever-increasing costs, and right now to buy their kids' Christmas gifts. It's not for them. This bill is not about them. It's for a small group of people, elites in among our society, who talk a lot to the Labor Party. Labor are very close to big business now and the big banks. We've seen it in the last few months. Alan Joyce would have loved this bill. Qantas is one of the biggest buyers and consumers of these green offsets; they would love this. And the Labor Party these days seem constantly to be talking just to them. Everything that comes to this place seems to be driven by and the result of what big business needs and wants, not what small business needs and not what families need. It's certainly not to help Australians who are being crushed by the homegrown inflation and cost-of-living crisis created by this government's wanton spending and lack of ability to get anything under control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't be supporting this bill, and I would hope that the Greens and others stay consistent to their principles against this. I actually share a lot of the Greens' criticisms of these systems. They are artificial, they are corrupt, they are for big business and they shouldn't be supported. Let's hope that common sense prevails and we don't end up with some dirty deals done cheaply here this evening that sell out the Australian people in favour of big business. Let's act to get the cost of living down for Australians, not make things harder for them.</span>

                    <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise in support of the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the associated bill, particularly after the completely nonsensical contribution from a senator who claims to stand up for regional Queensland. I live in regional Queensland, and this is something that people there are calling for. We know how important it is, and we know that there are three things that will get lost in this debate when senators, particularly those of the Liberal and National parties, come into this chamber. These are three really important things that I need people to understand and consider while these post-fact contributions are happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there is a crucial need to repair our natural environment right now. We can't wait. We've lost a decade to bickering, politics and negativity from the Liberal-National coalition. We've lost a decade. We have lost time and we need to make it up urgently. That is what everyone is telling us, particularly when it comes to the environment. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia state </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report, which I'll speak about shortly, confirms that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the things that are being lost in this debate are the very real and exciting opportunities that this scheme could unlock. They get lost by those opposite—they don't want to see those opportunities—but I see those opportunities firsthand in the work of nature repair happening in catchments around Queensland, all the way up the coast. I'm really proud see the work that's been going on. Just imagine the possibility if those small-scale projects that have had such a crucial environmental impact were given the ability to go full-scale. There would be so many jobs and so many partnerships supported. Those very real opportunities won't be spoken about by those opposite, but they are what we on this side of the chamber know will result from this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing that anyone in this chamber or outside this chamber should ever forget is that the Liberal and National parties will stand in the way of environmental reform every day of the week. It doesn't matter what type of reform it is. It wouldn't matter if they had actually drafted this bill themselves—which they did; they had a version of this bill and a version of this scheme. It doesn't matter what's in this bill; it's for the environment and it's for working alongside people to make sure we can repair our environment, so they're against it. Their arguments and the debate they want to have aren't about improving the environment or creating more jobs; they are just dead against any environmental reform. Anyone who lines up with them also lines up with their decades-long record on environmental destruction, vandalism and complete disregard for how important our environment actually is for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor today, in supporting this bill's passage through the Senate, is creating a world-first nature repair market. The Nature Repair Market Bill will see the introduction of a world-leading voluntary market framework to support landholders in protecting and restoring nature. This will make it easier for businesses, organisations, governments and individuals to invest in projects to protect and repair nature, because we don't want just to stop environmental decline; we want to repair it. We must. We need to right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about bringing people together on this journey. We talk about that a lot—not just in this chamber; I talk about it a lot in my work as this Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. For so long when it came to these debates, and it continues today through this discussion, the Liberals and Nationals would have you believe that we need to fit people, particularly people from regional Australia, into boxes, into a binary situation where it's farmers versus scientists, landowners versus conservationists, agriculture versus traditional owners, environment versus the economy, or farming jobs versus jobs on the reef. Respectfully, I'd argue that sometimes those from the Greens Party fall into that trap as well. But that's not how you deliver reform, and it's not how you deliver outcomes in regional Australia. Actually getting farmers, scientists, landowners, conservationists and First Nations people to sit down, partner and find the way that we can work together is how you get results. That's what the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 identifies: that there's an opportunity here if we bring people together instead of saying that you must always be on opposite sides of this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor bring people together in this space. It's what we've continued to do in the work that we've done for the environment, and for very good reasons. You don't have to delve too far into the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment</span> report to understand the seriousness of the task that we have at hand: one of environmental degradation, loss and inaction. We want to see our environment protected. Australians love the outdoors. We're so lucky to have such a diverse range of incredible landscapes, waterways, and ecosystems around us in our country. Maybe this is something that people like me who live in regional Australia take for granted sometimes, that we can just drive 45 minutes up the tablelands and jump into a waterfall and that we've got these pristine environments that are so beautiful. But, if we lose them, we lose so much about what makes Australia special. A healthy environment is important to communities, economies and our First Nations culture—our way of life. It impacts everything that we do. Just last week we saw an intense debate in this place and right around the country about protecting the mighty Murray-Darling, another critical environment asset. It's so important to our country, our regions and the people that live there. It's a river system that we want to ensure becomes healthier and more sustainable and one that we want to protect from future droughts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nature Repair Market Bill represents another important, pivotal moment for our environment. This is, despite what those opposite will have you believe, what the bill will do. The Nature Repair Market Bill, together with the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill, aims to establish a world-first nature repair market. The bills provide the legislative framework for a voluntary national market in biodiversity certificates to enable private investment in high-integrity projects to protect, manage, and restore nature. The market will be open to landholders, farmers, First Nations people, conservation groups and businesses. The market will enable project proponents to undertake projects that protect the environment and protect and enhance biodiversity on a range of land tenures, including the aquatic environment and the ocean to the extent of Australia's territorial sea. Project proponents will be able to apply to the Clean Energy Regulator for a unique biodiversity certificate that could then be sold to interested persons in the market, very simply being rewarded for the hard work that you put into the environment. They will be able to monetise this really important work that's already happening and be able to lift the scale of these projects from small-scale and admirable projects to big-change projects that make a huge difference to our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is framework legislation, and there will be rules and biodiversity assessment instruments introduced so we can get the methodology right. These legal instruments will be subject to consultation. It's really significant, I think, that what we are talking about is a market that will include tradeable biodiversity certificates, insurance and compliance arrangements, a public register and a nationally consistent approach for measuring biodiversity outcomes, because we know around Australia there are different credit schemes in place. People are talking about the opportunity that this could capture—</span>

Over the last month the Albanese Labor government's incompetent handling of and its incompetent response to the High Court decision of NZYQ has led to over 140 hardened criminals being released into the Australian community, and now we are seeing the consequences. Now the people of Australia are reaping the consequences of the incompetence of and bungling by the Albanese Labor government.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I'd like to speak this afternoon on the salmon industry in Tasmania and how important it is to our community and to our economy. Tasmania supplies over 90 per cent of salmon to the rest of Australia and is the largest exporter of salmon in the country. The annual total gross catch is worth over $1.075 billion, and the processed and packaged value is $1.408 billion. Furthermore, according to the salmon industry, it is due to grow to be worth more than a billion dollars annually by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The salmon industry in Tasmania is such an important part of our state, and it's part of our people. It supports over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in mostly regional Tasmania, which is good for our communities and good for our economy. Generations have worked in this proud industry, which is why I stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone who works in the salmon industry. Every Labor senator in this place, particularly my colleagues from Tasmania, believes in a sustainable salmon industry, and we do this because we know how important it is to the people of Tasmania and for the Tasmanian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the Australian Workers Union for jumping to the defence of the Tasmanian salmon industry after it faced relentless misinformation being spread by Tasmanian conservation group Environment Tasmania and other organisations which seek to do nothing other than destroy this proud, booming industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The salmon industry in Tasmania, as I said, is great for jobs and it's great for local economies. It's providing jobs and strengthening local economies in regional Tasmania. We will stand with the salmon industry every single day and combat the mistruths from those opposite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Toondah Harbour is the gateway to Minjerribah/Stradbroke Island and is home to one of Australia's most endangered birds, the eastern curlew. The fate of Toondah Harbour now rests solely with environment minister Tanya Plibersek, as she has now officially received the environmental impact statement for Walker Corporation's plans to build a private luxury apartment and retail complex in over 40 hectares of Ramsar listed wetlands. BirdLife Australia have highlighted how this project will not only destroy important feeding habitat for the critically endangered eastern curlew but also have global ramifications by undermining the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. You're not meant to build penthouses in internationally significant wetlands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critically endangered eastern curlew is also meant to be one of 20 priority birds identified in the federal government's new 10-year Threatened Species Action Plan, probably because its population has declined by 80 per cent in the last 30 years due to developments just like this one all along their coastal habitats. The federal environment department advised the former environment minister to reject an early iteration of this very proposal outright, noting that it was clearly unacceptable under the EPBC Act. Despite this advice, and perhaps due to the donation that was received by the Liberal Party from Walker Corporation at about the same time, then minister Frydenberg allowed it to progress. Dredging Ramsar listed wetlands for a canal estate, with luxury high-rise residences that no-one can actually afford, makes no sense except for the private profits of mega property developers like Walker Corporation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the EIS officially received, Minister Plibersek now has up to 40 business days to accept or reject this massive proposal by Walker Corporation. I'm calling on environment minister Plibersek to reject this proposal once and for all and save Toondah Harbour. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to talk about one part of the disability royal commission and its findings. It's one that's got a lot of publicity and has also set off a lot of panic among the parents of children with significant disabilities. This is in regard to special schools. There were a lot of recommendations that were unanimous amongst the commissioners, but this was not one. This was one that was a fifty-fifty split among the commissioners and the chair. They did not all support this, but there is a group that is pushing for special schools to be disbanded—for them to no longer exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is within an environment where we have high schools for academically gifted students, for athletically gifted students and for those that excel in the performing and creative arts, yet, somehow or other, children with a disability, particularly those with complex needs, are now meant to just be tumbled into the mainstream environment. This, quite frankly, does not work for a lot of students. There are students who have significant issues that require significant levels of support. Particularly when kids get to high school, there is no way that kids with significant intellectual and cognitive impairments have the executive functioning skills and capabilities to flourish within a mainstream environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to remember is that it is all about choice and control. All the commissioners agreed that one of the big functions and fundamentals within disability policy should be choice and control, yet three of these commissioners have come out and said, 'But, you know, we're going to remove one of those choices.' I speak from experience. I've had a son in mainstream school. I've had him in mainstream school in an autism stream, and we now attend a special school. The changes, growth and development within my son have been extraordinary, and the fact that families may be deprived of this as an option is absolutely shameful.</span>

It's a women-led community radio network amplifying the voices of women across the nation, especially those women generally overlooked in mainstream media, including rural women, women in remote communities, and disability and LGBTIQ+ networks. Through their Women's Weather Watcher program, they are also providing real-time weather pattern and disaster updates to women in rural communities and advocating for their inclusion in disaster preparedness, response and recovery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to know that femLINKpacific is made possible by the We Rise Coalition, which is funded by the Australian government. As a member of the Australian government, I'd like to warmly thank and commend those at femLINKpacific for the tangible, positive change they are bringing about in the Pacific.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  The Tasmanian Liberal government got a little bit of good news four days ago—a Newspoll showed a small lift in support. It was a tiny lift of one per cent for the Tasmanian Liberal government. On the other hand, support for the Tasmanian Labor Party dropped from 32 per cent to 29 per cent. This reverses what had been a steady rise for Tasmanian Labor since they put the federal Labor Party in charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After they were defeated in the 2022 state election, Tas Labor fell into a rather nasty heap, and the infighting reached a peak when a respected and newly elected Labor member of the upper house resigned, telling the media that he couldn't go on working in such a toxic environment. The state party hadn't won an election in eight years, so the big boys of federal Labor stepped in and put ex-senators Doug Cameron and Nick Sherry in charge. They told the media they would be calling the shots until the next election. The media release put out at the time says that this intervention—and I'm calling it a takeover—was about reinstating trust, respect and transparency. Really? How's that going for you guys down there?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of reasons Labor is going backwards in the polls. Here are just a couple of them. First they said they were against a stadium, then they said they weren't sure and then they voted to support it. The state Liberals had been promising donation reform for years and said they were going to set a disclosure cap at $5,000, but Labor stuck their chest out, promising they would be more transparent and pushed for a $1,000 limit. Then, when it came down to it, guess what? They caved in and voted with the government. Of course they would! That's why Tasmanian Labor are going backwards in the latest polls: because Tasmanians don't trust you, and when push comes to shove they get told how to vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with the Liberal Party. They put party before people. But I am feeling good, because Tasmanians know what's going on and you can see that in the latest poll. Support for the Independents is surging, and I can tell you what, Tasmanians, we're going to give you choice. Vote for the Independents. Vote for people like the micros and the Jacqui Lambie Network. If you want trust back in the system in Tasmania, you have no other choice other than to continue to let the big boys rule the parties.</span>

The World Nuclear Association estimates that uranium demand for nuclear energy in the year 2040 will double what it is today. About 60 reactors are under construction worldwide, and a further 110 are being planned.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  When the Albanese Labor government was elected in May last year, we had one simple objective: to create a better future for all Australians. As long as we have the privilege to hold government, Labor will work to achieve just that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place, those opposite have been aptly named the 'no-alition', and I'll give you a few examples of how they've earned that name. Those opposite opposed our cheaper medicines policy which has saved Australians $100 million in the last nine months. They opposed our 'secure jobs, better pay' workplace relations legislation, which has delivered the fastest wage growth on record and secured a range of measures for workers across the country. They opposed the cheaper child care which is taking pressure off household budgets for 1.2 Australian families. They opposed our energy price relief grant which is saving households up to 18 per cent on retail energy costs. Now they are grumbling that a minister for agriculture is calling on Coles and Woolies to freeze the price of ham before Christmas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, the 'noalition' have shown they stand for nothing and oppose everything. It's no wonder Australians gave them the boot at the last election, especially in my home state of Victoria. You'd need a magnifying glass to find a Liberal in Victoria because they are almost extinct. We had nine years of a rotten Liberal-National government that did nothing but neglect, mismanage and cut what matters most to Australian families. They stood for nothing when they were in power and they stand for nothing now in opposition. In nine years they racked up $1 trillion of debt but couldn't deliver a budget surplus—not one. We did it in our first year of government. But they did manage to have some mugs, of course!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australian politicians should now show solidarity with our Sikh community, who are the most visible targets of this extreme political violence. I know there's apprehension in the Sikh community about their safety here, and I can see why they are concerned. We have raised this directly with security agencies, including ASIO. ASIO has informed me that there is no current identifiable threat to the Sikh community here. The Sikh community is very visible in public places, especially when they are involved in politics. They deserve a clear and direct assurance from the Australian government that proactive measures are being taken to ensure their safety. There must be a public statement from our government to the government of India that these actions represent a gross breach of international law that offends Australian values. Our government needs to make it clear that if something like this occurs in Australia it will be taken as a hostile act that would fundamentally undermine our bilateral relationship. It is essential that this occurs now to prevent this violence from occurring in Australia. It's one thing to ride in a golden chariot and venerate a foreign political leader, but the hard politics is when you need to put principles and the collective good of Australians ahead of a media sugar hit or the promise of a lucrative trade deal. That's when politicians earn their keep.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  We'd all agree that every single domestic and family violence death is horrific. In my home state of South Australia, the number in the past month has been unprecedented, with the killing of five women. Tragically, the sector predicts we'll see further escalation of violence as the cost-of-living pressure in the home increases and there's the seasonal strain on relationships during the festive season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the tools to help turn things around. We have two national action plans that inform the National Plan to End Violence against Women and their Children, which outlines the work of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, and their commitment to delivering on the ambition of ending violence within a generation. So we have plans. But saying that you're doing something is one thing; what matters is that you are actually doing what you said you would do, and that what you are doing is being done with the urgency that's required. As shadow minister for child protection and the prevention of family violence, I know that we must get better at monitoring how this government, the states and the territories are turning words into action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prevention and early intervention are best for everybody—most importantly, though, for the children. A 39-year-old woman killed at Morphett Vale had five children. A woman fatally shot at Modbury North had a teenage daughter. An analysis of intimate partner homicides in Australia, highlighted in a newly released report by the University of Melbourne, indicates that 172 children have been bereaved through domestic violence in eight years. Imagine the heart-wrenching reality for these children. Trauma is compounded for children when they are the offspring of both the killer and the victim. Our response must be timely, responsive, and in sufficient measure in prevention, early intervention, response, recovery and healing, and it must be connected to those plans. It's 17 days of activism; we've got to do more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These are women that have probably never had an education. They'll come to Australia, bring their children and will not assimilate. I can see them on welfare for most of their lives because they will not be able to assimilate into our culture. My big concern is that these people may be Islamic fundamentalists. Are they going to be looked at properly, and is it viable to bring them to Australia? The man that was released from the detention centre—he's out there—was originally from Afghanistan. We have someone who is a sex offender on our streets.</span>

It is wrong to keep increasing the numbers. If you're going to bring people into the country, make sure they will assimilate. Make sure they are in tune with our culture and way of life and will assimilate into our society, which is more important to this country than bringing in people. There are 217,000: 66,000 applications that have been processed and another 150,000 in the pipeline. When will it be enough? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Examples include cabbages going from $4 to $9, coffee beans going from less than $24 a kilo to over $44 a kilo, a two-litre tub of ice cream going from $8 to $11, a large box of cereal going up from $5.50 to $10.80 and nappies going from $29 to $39 a packet in just 18 months. Another shopper got in touch and said that their local supermarket charged nearly $17 a kilo for simple sausages, which they calculated would equate to more than $10,000 for a single head of beef. I can assure folks our farmers are not being paid that amount of money. Despite supply-side challenges starting to reduce, prices are not coming 'down, down'; they are continuing to go 'up, up'. We will force the CEOs of the big supermarket corporations, Coles and Woolies, to come in, front the Greens-led inquiry into price gouging and explain, if they can, how they can justify prices going up. Millions of Australians are unable to afford to put a decent feed on the table during a cost-of-living crisis while rents are going through the roof, with a record series of interest rate rises, while their supermarkets are making billions of dollars in profit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">United Australia Party Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  We are told that the so-called gender pay gap has fallen for the second year in a row, hitting a record low of 13 per cent. But, by law, men and women must be paid the same wage for performing the same or comparable work. Why is there a gap? Is there a gap at all? The government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency claims that the gap is created by discrimination and bias, lower wages for female-dominated industries, a lack of workplace flexibility and higher rates of part-time work. But there is one glaring difference that they fail to mention: worker fatalities by gender. Every year, Safe Work Australia compiles the data, and the sad fact is that the rate of fatalities per 100,000 workers is 28 times higher for men than for women. Out of 194 people killed at work in 2020—which are the most recent statistics that we have—186 were men and eight were women. That's because the most dangerous occupations—machine operators, labourers et cetera—are dominated by men. Worker fatalities are also concentrated, obviously, in male-dominated industries. Agriculture, forestry and fishing had the highest rate of fatalities, followed by transport, postal and warehousing, with construction in third place. And it's not just deaths. The incidence rate for serious injuries was almost twice as high for men as for women. In reality—and this is the reality—a big part of the pay gap between men and women amounts to what I would call 'danger money'. Men do more dangerous work and often end up paying with their lives. There is no such thing as the gender pay gap. There are only differences and different choices, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that.</span>

In 2023, improvements were also made amongst Australians accessing varied support services, with more of us seeing a GP, using digital services, seeing a professional such as a psychologist and looking for online self-help information and support. Unfortunately, the report also underscores that 58 per cent of Australians reported the rising cost of living as having a big impact on their mental health. There are groups who are particularly vulnerable to the crisis, and the report suggests that First Nations people were most impacted, with a rate 16 per cent higher than the general population. These discrepancies are not new, but we must address them so that Australians can strive for good mental health and equal access to support.</span>

It has now been reported that a further detainee, a former ringleader of a child exploitation gang, released by your government from immigration detention, has been arrested in Dandenong amid allegations he has breached his reporting obligations and made contact with minors. It is reported that this man is a registered sex offender, previously alleged by police to have headed a prostitution ring which preyed on children in state care. A court was told how he once traded a pack of cigarettes for sex with a 13-year-old girl. You had five months of warning that the NZYQ case might not go your way, but when the orders were handed down the only thing your government was ready to do was to release these detainees into the Australian community. Minister, why can't your government keep children safe?</span>

The release was a decision of the High Court. The release was a decision of the High Court of Australia, a decision against which the government argued. But, as a government in this system, we are bound to observe the decisions of the High Court. I would have thought somebody who was a lawyer and the shadow Attorney-General might respect the separation of powers. Having said that, it is our first priority to work to keep Australians safe. And unlike those opposite, who are only interested in fighting about this, we are interested in working to fix it. We are working to fix it, and that is what we are doing.</span>

Australia is privileged to have a rich multicultural society, and values of tolerance and respect are at the core of who we are. Australians fought and died in the fight against fascist ideologies, including Nazism, that are built on antisemitism and on prejudice. Extremist views like Nazism must be met with uncompromising condemnation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nazi rally at the weekend was appalling and unacceptable and has no place in Australia. Sadly, it comes at a time when we have seen an increase in antisemitism more broadly. Nazism and fascism cannot be normalised and they cannot be defended on grounds of freedom of speech because they inflict real and direct harm and they are in direct opposition to liberal democracy. They are ideologies that work by dehumanising—by singling out people as outsiders and second-class citizens who are not deserving of the protections and dignities afforded to full members of the community. This is what the Nazis did. Nazism and fascism dehumanised Jews, gays, people with disabilities, Slavs, Roma, people of colour as well as people of different political views, labelling whole groups of people as subhuman. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reminds us again why hate speech is so dangerous. Hatred in speech led to hatred in deed, with six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and millions more declared subhuman were also killed by the Nazis. History shows that genocides, mass atrocities, systemic forms of enslavement and ill-treatment have been fuelled by hate speech, which dehumanises and blames victims. Anyone who refuses to denounce Nazism or other extremist ideologies has not learned the lessons of history. All of us must always stand against those whose rhetoric undermines our diversity, our tolerance and our values.</span>

Everyone must be able to live their lives free from fear and intimidation. The Albanese government has developed a package of support for Australian communities affected by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. This includes a $25 million grant to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry to immediately improve safety at Jewish schools and preschools across Australia and $25 million to Australian Palestinian, Muslim and other communities to support safety, security, mental health, cohesion and education objectives. We acted swiftly after the 7 October attacks to make these commitments because all Australians deserve to live in a country that is peaceful, accepting and respectful. </span>

All of us in this place have a platform, and we must use our platforms to bring our community together and not to inflame tensions.

Minister, both Senator Paterson in this place and the Leader of the Opposition quickly called for a preventive detention regime to be put in place to protect the Australian community since your government decided to release detainees including paedophiles, rapists, murderers and a contract killer into the Australian community following the NZYQ case. Again, you had five months of warnings that this case might not go your way, but when the orders were handed down the only thing the Albanese government was ready to do was to release detainees into the Australian community.</span>

The Albanese government's failure to prepare for the High Court decision has turned a bad result into a catastrophic one. Why was there no preparation? Why were there no contingencies? Why couldn't your government make plans to keep Australians safe?</span>

Of course, you may not have made yourselves available to be briefed on them, because Mr Tehan is too busy being at the Jericho Cup in Warrnambool and others are overseas. I would make the point that we have tabled amendments. We look forward to your support and we look forward to an explanation to all those here and beyond as to why you voted with the Greens against strengthening legislation to protect Australians. So, when you come in and talk to us about keeping Australians safe, let everyone remember that you are the group, you are the party, that voted against strengthening the visa conditions and the criminal penalties associated with them, because you are always about the political fight. You are never about fixing the problem.</span>

Why don't you have a look at the amendments for the preventive detention regime, which is actually about Australians—keeping Australians safe. And make sure that you support it, because what we know is that you're always more interested in a political fight than in fixing the problem. We are working to fix the problem.

Minister, RUAG Australia is the sole manufacturer of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's weapons bay door uplocks. Without that military equipment, the F-35 fighter currently being used by the Israeli military to bomb Gaza would be denied its lethal capability as a weapon. Can the minister please explain the government's position on providing this military equipment to Israel?</span>

The advice I have is what the government has already made clear—that Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years. Australia has a stringent export control framework which ensures military and dual-use items are used responsibly outside of Australia in ways which do not violate human rights. I'm advised that Defence undertakes a rigorous assessment of each export application.</span>

I would make the point that I am seeking to answer the question by looking to the legal framework which applies to the relevant export. I would have thought that's entirely relevant, Senator Shoebridge. I know you may not like it, but it is relevant. And, with respect, as to 'a putative future bill': this is a bill that has been introduced. It reflects the government's desire or intention to strengthen our export controls framework and ensure that the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012 remains effective, efficient and fit for purpose. I again reiterate the indication I have made earlier, as has the Deputy Prime Minister, in relation to the supply of these weapons.</span>

As I've said before, she, like many in this chamber, has dedicated her life to working for working people, unlike those that we see in the opposition who have dedicated their careers to keeping wages low. The Albanese government's No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know a lot of people are doing it tough in Australia right now, and that's why we're doing as much as we possibly can to assist. It's why we're delivering targeted relief while not adding to inflation. That includes delivering electricity bill relief, which was opposed by the opposition; making medicines cheaper, which was opposed by the opposition; delivering cheaper child care, which was opposed by the opposition; and, importantly, ensuring wages rise at the fastest rate in a decade, including for minimum-wage and aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, the Albanese Labor government is also committed to helping Australians deal with cost-of-living pressures through higher wages. As I've said, we know that a lot of people are doing it tough right now, and ensuring that people have higher wages is an important part of making sure that they can deal with cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts don't suit the opposition, because the facts show that wages are moving again under the Albanese Labor government. We've had two consecutive quarters of real wage growth. The latest wage growth data is at four per cent. Under those opposite, it averaged just 2.1 per cent. Under the opposition there was half the wage growth that we are now seeing under the Albanese Labor government. That's because of things like aged-care workers receiving an historic 15 per cent wage rise from the Fair Work Commission, supported by the Albanese government. We've seen increases to award wages. Under the opposition, it was 4.6 per cent in 2022. Under Labor, it was 5.75 per cent in 2023. We've seen the gender pay gap reduced to the lowest it has ever been an Australian history. Meanwhile, we still see unemployment remain at an historic low of 3.7 per cent.</span>

There they are, every single one of them, looking at us bemoaning the fact that Australians are getting higher wages again, including two consecutive quarters of real wage growth. We know that, for those opposite, keeping wages low was a deliberate design feature for the entire time they were in office. Compare the approaches that the respective governments took to the annual wage review for Australia's lowest-paid workers. Under the Albanese government, we said that the Fair Work Commission should ensure that the wages of our lowest-paid workers do not go backwards. What did we see under the coalition? Not only did they say that low wages were a deliberate design feature but there was a subheading in their submission on the minimum wage labelled 'The importance of low-paid work'. Do you know how important it was for low-paid workers? It was very important to make sure they could get wage rises to deal with cost-of-living pressures. And while we know there is more to be done, the Albanese government is delivering those higher wages.</span>

That is why we were so pleased to have seen two consecutive quarters of real wage growth—wages lifting above inflation. We know the job is not done. We know that Australians are dealing with cost-of-living pressures and more needs to be done but we also know on this side of the chamber that higher wages are part of dealing with that. But it would appear there are some members at least on the opposite side who still have yet to learn the lesson, because we all heard Senator Hume yesterday interject, saying that wage rises push up inflation too—talk about saying the quiet bit out loud! What we now know from Senator Hume, the shadow finance minister, and the entire opposition, is that, if they were ever re-elected to government, it would be back to low wages. They still oppose higher wages. They still think low wages are a deliberate design feature of their economic policy, and all those people in the gallery would be getting lower wages if they ever get back into government.</span>

My question is to the Minister representing to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Senator Watt. In August the government said that you would complete an impact analysis and release details of your fuel efficiency standards before the end of this year. Given that we have fewer than three sitting days left and three weeks to Christmas, when can we expect to see the standards released?</span>

                  </a>  Senator Pocock, you are right. The Albanese government is committed to delivering fuel efficiency standards, something that should have happened in Australia a very long time ago, and we have previously committed to delivering those standards as soon as possible. We did also say that we would take the time to get the design right. We hoped that it would be completed at the end of this year but the reality is it is a complex matter and it may stretch into the new year but we are firmly committed to getting this in place as quickly as we can. For anyone who is wondering about why it hasn't been done yet I, again, invite you to take a look at those opposite, because it was those opposite whose attitude to electric vehicles was that they would 'end the weekend', so for 10 years we had no action whatsoever under the coalition to do anything about electric vehicles, anything about fuel efficiency standards. What that has resulted in is Australia joining Russia as one of the only advanced economies without fuel efficiency standards. What an effort to congratulate yourselves on after 10 years of government, being right in line with Russia in delivering no fuel efficiency standards because you preferred to run around and run ridiculous campaigns about electric vehicles 'ending the weekend'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pocock, I can assure you that this is something that the Albanese government takes seriously. We are committed to delivering those standards. In the meantime, what we've done is get electric vehicle sales up from two per cent of new car sales when we when came to office to almost nine per cent for the first three-quarters of this year. Now, more than two-thirds of the electric vehicles on Australia's roads today have been added under this government in only 18 months period of time. We've made electric vehicles cheaper. We've got more public chargers out in Australia. We're getting more choice into the market, and we'll be delivering fuel efficiency standards as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The reality is that not only is this a complex matter but, as in so many areas affecting climate policy and right across the policy spectrum, we saw a complete blank slate on this picture when we came to office. We were run for 10 years by a group of people who thought that electric vehicles—actually, they didn't think that electric vehicles would end the weekend; they just went out and said that to try and scare people off. We've grabbed the ball, and we're running with it by doing the hard work that's necessary to deliver these fuel efficiency standards. That is why, in the meantime, as I say—</span>

As I've already indicated in an answer to a different question, we absolutely understand that cost-of-living pressures is the number one issue facing Australians right now. I also agree with your view that delivering lower emission vehicles, electric vehicles, is an important way of assisting Australians to deal with what are otherwise petrol price rises that we see all too regularly. We are working on the fuel efficiency standards, but I reiterate the point that that's not the only thing we're doing. We've already got electric vehicle sales up—I gave you the figures—from two per cent of new car sales when we came to office to almost nine per cent for the first three-quarters of this year. We've made electric vehicles cheaper by cutting taxes on electric vehicles. That can save up to $11,000 a year on a $50,000 electric vehicle, and leasing an electric vehicle like a Tesla model 3 can now cost less month-to-month than leasing a similar petrol vehicle like a Mazda 3. As well, we are delivering more public chargers. So after 10 years of doing nothing and rubbishing the idea, we're getting on with it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Library research on the number of starred officers in the Australian Defence Force—that is, generals, admirals, air marshals and the like—demonstrates that the Australian Defence Force has been growing its senior command by an enormous amount over the last few decades. In the last decade, there has been an increase in starred officers despite a reduction in ships, aircraft and boots on the ground. Since 1983, the ratio of starred officers to enlisted personnel has increased by about eight times. Forty years ago, there was one general for every 1,800-odd serving people. Now there is one for every 250. Minister, what benefit does the Australian Defence Force get from having so many senior officers?</span>

                  </a>  Okay, that was not intended, actually. Sorry. The overarching proposition is that the military, over time, has had to adapt and modernise to a very different operating environment to the one that you might have been referring to when the ratio was one to 1,800. I am advised that over the last three years Defence has experienced some 13 per cent growth, representing an increase of 13 one-star, 15 two-star and two three-star officers in senior ADF appointments, driven by government outcomes and the need to maintain capability. Growth relating to government directed outcomes includes: support to the COVID-19 response, national bushfire recovery, Queensland floods, overseas operations, the nuclear powered submarines program and the Defence Strategic Review. Other growth has supported the Inspector-General of the ADF Afghanistan inquiry and the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, the enhancement of space, cyber and intelligence functions and the enhancement of operational cooperation and interoperability. The brief I have says that Defence will continue to review all aspects of the ADF to ensure it is able to deliver on government direction and be sustainable and fit for purpose. More broadly, obviously there remains an ongoing challenge and an imperative for recruitment—which the senator is well aware of—which the ADF is seeking to address. </span>

The $45 billion—that's right, $45 billion—taxpayer funded Hunter class frigate program is under fire, yet again, from the ANAO for being 'poor value for money'. AUKUS is a multi-decade program set to cost 10 times what the frigates will cost. Minister, how can the Australian people possibly have any confidence that AUKUS won't be just another stuff-up? </span>

It may well be that, with hindsight, Mr Pyne might have made a different decision than the one that he made. We came to government and we inherited this program. As you know, as a consequence of the Defence Strategic Review, the government commissioned a Navy surface fleet review which included the Hunter frigates. Obviously, the government will work methodically through the recommendations of that review, which was received in the last couple of months. I think the Deputy Prime Minister has made clear that the government will respond formally in the early part of next year. More broadly, the point about defence procurement and its capability in doing that, we are very conscious of the importance of trying to continue to reform— <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

I don't agree with everything you've said, but they have been identified in a range of reports. Defence procurement is obviously a very complex process. I would say that what we are seeking to do is to try and ensure, particularly with AUKUS and the establishment of the Australian Submarine Agency, that there is a dedicated entity that is focused single-mindedly on this enterprise. In your first supplementary question, you correctly identified that the AUKUS undertaking is probably the largest procurement that a government has entered into. It is critical we get it right and that we learn from the mistakes that were made in the past so that they are not repeated. Certainly, the government is very focused on working to ensure that occurs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

My question is for the minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Minister Wong. Your government recently lodged a defence in the Federal Court for a claim brought by some Australians from the Torres Strait that the government had breached its duty of care to protect them from that bogeyman, climate change. In your government's defence lodged with the court, government lawyers stated that Australia contributes only a very small proportion of global emissions and that it was not reasonably foreseeable that anyone would suffer loss or damage regardless of any action or inaction taken by Australia on climate change. Minister, do you agree with the government's defence that Australia cannot change the climate?</span>

I don't disagree with your joke about it as a bogeyman, and I think that scientists have observed patterns of climate that demonstrate that we do have a serious problem. I also believe that no one country can solve it on its own. That has always been my position. That's why Australia has always argued, certainly in the governments in which I have been involved, we for an international agreement which covered all major emitters and in which all countries participated, because no single country can solve it on its own.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So yes, Australia cannot solve climate change by ourselves but, equally, that should not be a reason for us to do nothing. If you don't accept the science, and I understand you don't—I think you are wrong, but I understand you don't—we should do something if only for economic imperatives. We know 84 per cent of the global economy is moving to a 'net zero emissions by 2050' position. If we want our children and grandchildren to be able to thrive in a world where there is a premium for low-carbon goods and services and for clean energy then surely we want our country being able to export and produce those goods and services.</span>

What is important to emphasise is that, as I recall, both parties of government have committed to net zero by 2050—at least, that's what those opposite did at some point. Secondly, this is about our economic prosperity as well as the need to do something about climate. I go back to the point I am making: if you accept that the world is moving to placing a premium on clean energy and on low-carbon goods and services then, as one of the most emissions-intensive economies in the world, it is sensible economic policy for us to be able to do better in that world. That is what we are intending to do. We are intending to make sure that we can use the enormous clean energy resources we have for the benefit of all Australians.</span>

On your numbers, even if Australia were to emit zero emissions from now to 2050, the temperature of the globe would change by just 0.000000768 degrees Celsius. Why are we imposing $270,000 on every Australian for, in effect, no impact on climate change? What about China?

Climate change can only be addressed and dealt with by all countries of the world responding. You ask: what about China? Of course the new installed capacity of China, as well as in many other countries, is a concern. It is a concern. That is why we need an international agreement of which we are part. That is why Paris, Glasgow and the UN Conference of the Parties to drive action by all countries is needed. That's the first point.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point is, again, the economic imperative. We have done well as a country, and it has been a good thing that we have been able to utilise the fossil fuel resources that we have. But at some point we have to be able to make our way in the world, prosper in the world and export to the world clean energy and goods and services which are low carbon, because the world will pay high prices for them over the decades to come. So there is an economic imperative as well as a climate change imperative.</span>

The Albanese government is acutely aware of the cost-of-living challenges facing many Australians and has undertaken measures to relieve cost-of-living pressures while not adding to inflation. Can the minister inform the Senate of the independent Reserve Bank's decision on interest rates today and what this decision means for Australians?</span>

Today, the independent Reserve Bank Board has decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.35 per cent. This is a welcome reprieve for millions of Australians, especially in the lead-up to Christmas, when we know budgets are tight. This decision follows recent news that inflation fell further in the month of October to 4.9 per cent, substantially lower than the 6.1 per cent it was when we were elected.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While inflation is moderating, it is still too high and we understand that many Australians are doing it tough. Inflation and cost of living are the biggest challenges facing Australians right now. That's why it's been a real focus of the Albanese government and why we are rolling out the $23 billion in cost-of-living relief that has been carefully calibrated to make sure that it eases pressure on households but doesn't add to inflation. In fact, two of the measures, those in relation to child care and our energy bill relief, actually put downward pressure on inflation, something that has been acknowledged by the ABS. It confirmed that our cost-of-living policies are putting downward pressure on inflation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government our economic plan has been focused on providing targeted cost-of-living relief, fixing the budget and investing in skills, housing and energy to lay the foundations for future growth. Our economic and fiscal strategy has been welcomed by credible organisations and commentators, who have seen the decisions we have taken about showing spending restraint, returning significant revenue upgrades to the budget and delivering a surplus. I will come back to that. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's also important, of course, to know that we have created hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We've got an unemployment rate with a three in front of it, the gender pay gap at record lows, the participation rate at a record high, business investment up and industrial disputes down. We've got a surplus that we've delivered. We didn't just say we would do it; we actually delivered upon it. These are the decisions that we have taken that prove that inflation has peaked, and it is moderating. We are pleased to see this. There's more work to do, obviously, but we are absolutely determined to ensure that our decisions support putting downward pressure on inflation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Overnight, the Israeli government raised the travel warning for Jewish citizens travelling to a number of countries, including Australia, to level 2, 'Potential threat', referencing the increase in hostility to Israelis and Jewish citizens and recommending that those staying in this country exercise increased precaution—a point that I note the minister didn't reference in response to a previous question today. Will the Prime Minister now accept the opposition leader's recommendation that National Cabinet identify and commit to practical measures to ensure the safety of Jewish Australians? Will the Prime Minister commit to seeking to secure a statement from tomorrow's National Cabinet in which the leaders of the Commonwealth and all states and territories confirm their support for Australia's Jewish community and condemn antisemitism in all its forms?</span>

It might be well for us all to remember that this is not an issue of partisanship; this is an issue of making sure that, from this place, we send a very clear message that all forms of prejudice and discrimination are to be condemned, that we work always for acceptance, respect and unity, that we condemn prejudice wherever we see it and that we condemn antisemitism just as we condemn all forms of prejudice, including Islamophobia and prejudice against other groups in society—prejudice against people for who they are.</span>

Australia is one of them, but those countries also include the United Kingdom, Germany, France and others. I will check the others, but I certainly know of the UK, Germany and France. We obviously want Australia to be a welcoming place for visitors. I think you would have heard in my first answer, and in many other things we have said, that there is no place for antisemitism in Australia and we must make sure it does not find a foothold here. I can certainly say that we will always denounce it and reject it utterly, just as we do all forms of racism and prejudice. I would say to the senator: I know Mr Dutton has made certain comments. I also see Senator Birmingham has made comments. This is not a partisan issue. This is actually an issue on which we should stand united.</span>

And I would welcome you making the same sorts of comments, Senator Chandler, because there are views in this chamber that are very different. There are people in this chamber who have very strong views about the Palestinian communities. There are people in this chamber who have very strong views about Jewish communities.

Australians have a proud history of manufacturing. We make things, and we do it well, and the Albanese government wants our nation to be a place that continues our great industrial heritage into the future. That's because, as all Australians know, Australian-made products means Australian-made jobs—Australian-made jobs in our suburbs and our regional areas and secure, well paid Australian made jobs in thriving new industries. The Albanese Labor government believes in Australian jobs, which is why we back a future made in Australia, and we're delivering one by leveraging our nation's strengths. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key pillar of this approach has been establishing the National Reconstruction Fund, a $15 billion job creation platform which last week was officially opened for business. Last week the government signed off on the fund's investment mandate, and now the independent National Reconstruction Fund Corporation can invest billions of dollars in boosting our economic competitiveness and building up our industrial muscle. The investment mandate sets out clear expectations from government, including the treatment of priority areas for investment, expected outcomes and rate of return. The National Reconstruction Fund is about backing Australian industry and business to invest in expanding their capacity, driving innovation and creating more jobs in communities. Australia can be a nation that makes things again, and the Albanese government is backing Australian industry, business and communities to make that happen.</span>

Our government wants to work with small and medium businesses looking to grow, providing them with practical, concrete support. Last week, our $392 million Industry Growth Program officially opened. SMEs can now apply for expert advice on getting their good ideas to market and expanding their companies, creating more jobs across Australia. Future rounds of the program will also deliver matched grant funding ranging from $50,000 to $5 million. We want a clear pathway for Australians with great ideas to turn their ideas into thriving businesses in Australia instead of moving overseas, and our plan to back industry will do just that.</span>

A new report released just last week by Industry Innovation and Science Australia showed that this government inherited a shrinking proportion of mid-sized manufacturing businesses that are critical to the future of manufacturing in Australia. Those opposite had a decade to support Australian manufacturers, but they lacked any cohesive industry policy, producing some of the lowest manufacturing self-sufficiency levels in the OECD. But there's a better way forward. The Albanese government is backing Australian know-how, promoting Australian made jobs and supporting Australian manufacturing.</span>

                  </a>  If the government had their house in order, this would have been done weeks ago. It would have been ready weeks ago, been done weeks ago and been able to pass this parliament. If they'd had the House sitting this week, it could have at least been done days ago in terms of passing through. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has stood in here today—Senator Wong is saying, 'Why isn't the opposition supporting this?' Well, when the government finally, belatedly, was dragged kicking and screaming to the point of proposing a preventive detention regime, it was already at the point where it couldn't pass the parliament before the House came back for its normal business on Thursday of this week. But if the government wants to come in here and taunt us and say, 'Bring it on,' we're ready. Bring it on. We are ready to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, if the government had competent ministers, this would have been done before detainees were released, because that is the real crime of the way the Albanese government has handled this matter. The real crime of the Albanese government's handling of this matter is that detainees—murderers, rapists, paedophiles—were released before preventive orders were put in place and before measures to protect Australians from harm were put in place. That is the real crime of what has occurred. In failure upon failure from the Albanese government, they have stumbled at every turn in relation to this matter. They stumbled, it seems, in relation to the case they put before the High Court. They talked out of both sides of their mouth before the court, with the Human Rights Commission arguing one thing, having been approved to enter the court by the Attorney-General, whilst the government put an alternative proposition to the High Court. They presented evidence to the court suggesting that the individual subject of the case could not be deported, yet it appears the government may have had contrary advice to that, therefore providing evidence, a statement of fact, that undermined their very own case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they mismanaged the case itself, but then they weren't even prepared for any of the consequences of the case. Where were the contingency plans from the Albanese government? There were none because, clearly, Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil are completely incapable of managing their portfolios or of thinking ahead. It is incompetence that does not warrant the holding of ministerial office. These ministers should go. They should go because not only have they let the government down and caused immense political pain for the government; more particularly, they have exposed the Australian people to danger, to harm. This is the exposure that is the real risk and danger for the Australian people as a result of the Albanese government's mismanagement.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                  </a>  We were here when the decision was handed down, and ministers opposite were asked, 'What's going to happen to other individuals affected by this case, by this decision of the High Court?' Do you know what ministers said on that day? They said: 'Nothing is going to happen yet. We're going to wait to see the statement of reasons from the High Court.' That was what Minister Giles was telling the country, that was what Minister O'Neil was telling the country and that was what the Prime Minister and representing ministers in this chamber were telling the country: 'Be calm. You're safe because we're going to wait for the statement of reasons.' But what transpired? They changed their mind. They didn't wait for the statement of reasons. They panicked, they did whatever it was happening in the background, they felt pressure from the Left—whatever it was that caused the government to then open the floodgates in releasing the murderers, rapists, paedophiles, contract killers and others who had been detained back into the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they made that decision to release them in advance of the High Court's statement of reasons, had they put in place any safety measures in terms of how those individuals would be tracked or traced or how Australians would be protected? No, they hadn't. The opposition had to call for legislation. The government brought forward legislation which, on the day it brought it forward, at breakfast time, was the toughest it could be. But by lunchtime they'd accepted six amendments from the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, as ways to strengthen those measures. The government then released individuals who apparently managed to avoid having those ankle bracelets or other measures put in place. So we had a situation where the government said they wouldn't release people but then did, then made up protections after they'd released them and then failed to institute those protections on different individuals, and said the legislation was as tough as it could be—except, it turned out, when the opposition had suggestions it could be tougher. So, ultimately, we've got a situation where this government has been caught out flat-footed—and the ministers! There is the absolute failure of Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil to be in a position to actually manage this issue properly. If they'd been doing their job, the contingencies would have been in place. If they'd been doing their job, they would have had plans should the High Court case have gone against the government. If they'd been doing their job, those plans would have included a preventive detention regime, which, again, the government didn't move on until after the opposition had proposed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the opposition's proposal was confirmed as valid when, finally, the statement of reasons was released by the High Court. Imagine if the government had either done the contingency and had the preventive detention regime in place or had the legislation ready to go and, alongside that, held its nerve and waited until the statement of reasons was released. Those two things could have had a profound difference. Why would they have made a profound difference? Because we wouldn't have what's occurring in the Australian community right now, which is to see crimes being committed by the very people released under this government. That is the most serious part of what has occurred here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality that this government has proceeded to release individuals, because it was flat-footed, because it hadn't done the contingency work, and to release them in ways that have now seen Australians suffer harm. They have failed the most serious test of a government, which is to keep Australians safe. They've failed that test at a range of hurdles throughout this, and, as much as those opposite may sigh or moan, their sighing and moaning is nothing compared to the potential pain and anguish that is now being faced by those Australians.</span>

This government won't take responsibility for any of its failures. It's amazing. You'd think with ministers as hapless as Ministers Giles and O'Neill they would take responsibility for the failures. You'd think those ministers would be gone, now or at least over the summer period, and the government could reset itself off of that disaster. But, no, instead, the government is trying to act in a state of denial, pretend that it's being tough when ultimately it has been led every step of the way in its legislation, its amendments and its proposals—the preventive detention regime has been proposed by Mr Dutton and the opposition. The only leadership that has been shown since the High Court case was handed down has come from Mr Dutton, Senator Paterson, Senator Cash, Mr Tehan and others, who have sought to make sure that the government acts in ways that is necessary.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Strong criminal offences are the most effective response to breaches of these visa conditions for the NZYQ-affected cohort. This is because—by reason of the High Court's decision—the normal consequences of breaching visa conditions do not apply. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The intent of the Government is clear—that certain behaviours are unacceptable, and that there strong, proportionate and immediate consequences for the breach of these visa conditions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023, which, I note, has been brought on after the agreement to a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Birmingham, and I congratulate Senator Birmingham for doing that. Here we are, just after question time on a Tuesday but almost one month after the High Court handed down its ruling in the NZYQ case. The government, at the behest of the opposition, ironically, is finally doing what the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Paterson and the coalition have been asking them to do—in fact, saying to them, pleading with them: 'You need to introduce a protective detention regime. You need to.' We have been asking them to introduce legislation allowing law enforcement agencies to lock up high-risk individuals who have now been roaming free in communities in Australia. Tragically, as we now know, two of them have been charged with allegedly committing offences of sexual assault, and, what is worse, one of the offences was against a minor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the record, though, let me remind you of how we got here today. The High Court of Australia handed down its decision on 8 November. That is almost four weeks ago today. The next day, the government told us the individual in the High Court decision had been released, but, when asked about the potential release of other individuals in the cohort, Senator Watt actually said, 'We're not a government that acts on decisions that haven't had reasons released.' Guess what? On the Friday of that week we found out that, contrary to Senator Watt's evidence, the Albanese government was immediately releasing a large number of high-risk individuals. As we know, that cohort included rapists, murderers, paedophiles and even a contract killer. They were releasing them from immigration detention, following the High Court decision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The following Monday the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Giles, told us that 80 individuals had been released 'subject to a range of strict, mandatory visa conditions'. Two days later, what did we have? Senator Wong admitted that the consequences of breaching these visa conditions were ultimately unenforceable—you've got to be kidding me—because breaching a visa requires that an individual be detained pending deportation, which the High Court had ruled was not applicable to this cohort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After continued calls from the coalition to take action to keep Australians safe—because, I can tell you, Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, and the coalition understand that the fundamental responsibility of the Commonwealth government is the security and safety of all Australians—the government finally introduced a bill at the end of the last sitting period, on 16 November. The government gave us less than two hours notice before the bill was introduced. But, even in that ridiculous time frame, let me tell you one thing—I was at the briefing with the Leader of the Opposition, Minister Tehan and Senator Paterson. We were given the legislation and we were told by Minister O'Neil, 'This is as tough as it gets. We are pushing the boundaries of what the law will entitle us to do. We can't make it any stronger.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what? We identified weaknesses in Labor's legislation, and let me tell you what they were. Labor's legislation did not stop paedophiles going near schools. What an omission. It didn't stop violent criminals from contacting their victims. You've got to be kidding me. It didn't allow the most basic protective measures like electronic monitoring and curfews. This is the legislation about which, at the briefing, Minister O'Neil had kept on saying, 'It is as tough as it can be. The government has gone as far as it can.' The coalition stepped in and presented six amendments to the government, and, despite the government telling us how tough this legislation was and that they were pushing the limits of the law, they had to roll over and accept all six amendments. Thank goodness the coalition was able to step in and clean up Labor's mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, what have we learnt? The Albanese Labor government has now released at least 147 high-risk individuals into the community, and each day we wake up and find out that another high-risk individual—remembering this cohort includes rapists, murderers, a contract killer and a paedophile—has been happily released by this government into the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To say that Labor's handling of this issue has been an absolute debacle from the start is, quite frankly, an understatement. Last week we heard reports that one of the detainees—who refused to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and who is, by definition, a risk to the Australian community—had absconded. In other words, the Albanese government lost one. You've got to be kidding me. They let them out and then they lost somebody who is a high risk to the Australian community. He absconded and he was unreachable by our law enforcement agencies for days before he was finally located. And guess what? When asked about the matter, Minister O'Neil, far from taking responsibility, washed her hands and said: 'Oh. Well, that's a police matter now.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And now for this week: and I have to say, this week the greatest fears of the coalition were realised. Yesterday, Monday, we heard reports that a convicted sexual predator, released by the Albanese Labor government, had been arrested and charged with indecently assaulting a woman in South Australia. This is a man who was once labelled by a judge, in sentencing this man, 'a danger to the Australian community' and 'an ongoing risk to women'. Hands up from the Labor government, though. They were prepared to compromise the safety and the security of the Australian people. And then today—these are possibly our worst fears—we heard reports that a further detainee, again released by the Albanese Labor government, a former ringleader of a child exploitation gang, had been arrested in Dandenong amid allegations he had breached his reporting obligations and had made contact with minors. This is a man who is reportedly a registered sex offender, previously alleged by police to have headed a prostitution ring which preyed on children in state care. A court was told how he once traded a packet of cigarettes for sex with a 13-year-old girl.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the types of people that the Albanese Labor government have let out. Forget the safety and security of the Australian people! A man that a judge says was a danger to the Australian community and an ongoing risk to Australian women, and a man whom a court was told once traded a pack of cigarettes for sex with a 13-year-old child—the Albanese government was prepared to let them out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, since day one, we—the Leader of the Opposition; Senator Paterson; I, myself; Mr Tehan; and the coalition—have been calling for a preventive detention regime, and you don't need to be Einstein, quite frankly, to figure out why. It was to prevent the exact two scenarios that have now occurred in the Australian community. But that was all too hard. It was all too hard for the incompetent Minister O'Neil and the hopeless Minister Giles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>
                    </a>  Senator Cash, I'm going to ask you to withdraw both of those comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CASH:</span>
                    </a>  It was all too hard for Minister O'Neil and Minister Giles, who, by their actions, have shown themselves to be incompetent in their portfolios. They have dithered and they have dallied. They have made excuse after excuse. They make excuses today, in relation to the woman assaulted in South Australia. They make excuses today in relation to the minor who's been allegedly assaulted. And meanwhile, what happens every day? There comes release after release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government had acted earlier and moved to introduce a preventive detention regime as soon as the High Court decision came down a month ago—as the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, called for—the outcome may have been different. Make no mistake: this is a tragedy, born of a catastrophic failure of the Albanese government, and the government alone must be held accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also possible that many of the individuals who have now been released never needed to be released in the first place. The NZYQ case related to a single individual. The orders made on 8 November concerned a single person. But, for some baffling reason, without the reasons for the High Court's decision, they decided to get ahead of the High Court, and the Albanese Labor government started releasing rapists, murderers, paedophiles and a contract killer—detainees, in bulk, before the High Court had even had a chance to put pen to paper. They could have used the intervening time to get ready. They could have ordered an assessment and evaluation of every single detainee. They could have put in place arrangements for contingencies. But they did nothing. With every passing day now, as we learn more about how the government handled this case, the scale of their incompetence and mismanagement becomes clearer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">NZYQ was a serious child sex offender. He raped a 10-year-old boy. The coalition cancelled his visa, with the result that he was put in immigration detention following his sentence. This was the case that was before the court. But guess what? The reason we're standing here today is the path followed by the Albanese Labor government, because, when this case came before the court, the Labor government made concessions, and those concessions are the key to why we are standing here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government made concessions in a 'special case'. That is a document that records the facts put before the court, and the special case contains what the High Court called two important facts. The court put significant weight on the two concessions that the Albanese Labor government made on 30 May. The first was that NZYQ could not then be removed from Australia. The second was that there was no real prospect of the plaintiff being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. They made those concessions on 30 May even though they hadn't actually finished making inquiries about whether he could be resettled. Why in God's name would this government make those concessions and set the High Court on a certain path if they were not true? Seriously, they were continuing to make inquiries with other countries. As has been revealed by the High Court reasons in August, when they realised the magnitude of their stuff-up, they started making inquiries with Five Eyes partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us make this clear. They conceded there was no way NZYQ was going to be removed from Australia because no-one would take him. Then, after making that concession which forced the court's hand, they decided to go and check. Maybe, if the responsible ministers had done their jobs, we would not have landed where we are. Maybe this case would have been unnecessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted with matters of national security. It has shown utter contempt for Australian communities who, rightly, want the government to come clean on where these criminals are located and what they have been convicted of. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we are going to be moving an additional amendment to strengthen the provisions of this bill. We will do this by moving an amendment requiring the minister to report to parliament any time one of these dangerous individuals is released into the community. This amendment will go some way to providing this much-needed transparency from this hopeless, hapless government, and I hope the government and the crossbench will see fit to support what is a modest but sensible amendment and to start cleaning up the mess the Albanese government has made. </span>

We all know how this is going to end and we all know that it's not going to end well because we've seen this story time after time in this country and we've seen the tragic ending to this story time after time, where innocent refugees are murdered, where innocent refugee children are subjected to sex abuse, where innocent refugee women are raped, where innocent refugees and people who sought asylum in this country are detained indefinitely and tortured because the Labor and Liberal parties have a dark vein running through their political circuitry. If there is one thing they can agree on, it is that refugees are there to be brutalised and dehumanised and to have their human rights trampled. The instinct to collude in order to brutalise and demonise refugees runs all too strongly through the veins of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party has not just handed over the drafter's pen to Mr Dutton, allowing him to draft anti-refugee legislation that the Labor Party will support, but is now handing over chamber management duties to the opposition. Mr Dutton is not just running the government's policy, he is running the business of the government in the Senate. The Labor Party has just voted for a Mr Dutton motion to manage their hours, a Mr Dutton motion to jam through a bill which has had attached to it 70 pages of amendments with an explanatory memorandum that is so big it needed to be bound into a book—and we got it three hours ago. This is a shameful way to legislate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are dealing with a fundamental human right here, the right to liberty. That is not an absolute right, but it is a critical right. It should not be overridden nor curtailed without the most careful consideration, but here we are with an explanatory memorandum of nearly 150 pages and with 70 pages of amendments, as well as the original bill that we are debating. This is legislation that severely curtails liberty in Australia for a small group of people in a way we would never dare to try on citizens—but we can do it because we are a bunch of xenophobes. That is what this legislation is. It is xenophobic by definition. It only applies to foreigners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen where this path ends, but it is worth noting how we take the steps down it. It is a pattern that has been repeated in recent Australian history over the 20-plus years since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> appeared over the horizon. We all know what happened back then. Former prime minister John Howard saw a political opportunity available to him through demonising a group of desperate and innocent people who were seeking asylum in Australia, people who had been through the most horrendous experience on the high seas. The Murdoch media came in behind the LNP and magnified the confected emergency that Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock created at the time, and the Labor Party rolled over in craven capitulation. We saw it again in 2013, when the Labor Party was in government and the next iteration of offshore detention was created, another dark and bloody stain on our country's national story. We have seen it again over the last few weeks post the High Court's recent decision which, quite rightly, rendered indefinite immigration detention unlawful in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the confected emergency from Mr Dutton. We've seen News Corp and far too many other journalists from a range of media outlets in Australia credulously reporting the lies of the opposition, credulously reporting that, somehow, every person caught within the scope of that High Court decision was some kind of vicious criminal, when nothing could be further from the truth. I've sat through interview after interview by ABC journalists who enthusiastically and credulously ran Mr Dutton's speaking points at me. I expect that from Sky, but I don't expect it from the ABC. It's disgraceful. There have been honourable exceptions, but collectively the press gallery in this country needs to take a good, long look in the mirror and realise that they play a critical role in this dark and bloody path that this country walks down in regard to refugee policy and immigration detention policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on every journalist who has failed to call out the lies of the opposition. Shame on every journalist who has bought the frame that somehow all of the people caught within the High Court decision are hardened criminals, when we know many of them have never been convicted of a crime in their lives. We know there are people who have been living in the community peacefully for a long time that are now caught under the scope of this legislation because it's shoddily drafted and has been rammed through in haste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, the way we treat refugees is instructive, so I'm telling you now—and I'm telling the Australian people now—that the way the Labor and Liberal parties treat refugees is the same as they would treat the rest of Australia if they thought they could get away with it. They would ride roughshod over your human rights if they thought they could get away with it. How do we know that? It's because they're prepared to do it to a group of people just because of their visa status or just because they are foreigners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're facing here is rushed, shoddy, xenophobic legislation. This is a dark, dark day in the Senate's history, and you can add it to a range of dark, dark days in the Senate's history. Time after time in this place, the major parties have got together to do over refugees and do over people who are seeking asylum. We live in a settler colonial society in Australia, and we have had trouble with the concept of liberty in this country since the first convicts arrived over 200 years ago. We have never come to grips with the critical right to freedom and liberty. This place was founded as a carceral state, and it exists as a carceral state today. This debate is proof of that. It is clear and obvious proof that we're a prison state. When it all gets too hard, we just reflexively lock people up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really clear about the group of people that this legislation deals with. It is a small group of people, some of whom—not all—have been convicted of crimes. In at least a small number of cases, they have been convicted of heinous crimes. That is absolutely true, just as, on a regular basis, Australian citizens are convicted of heinous crimes. The difference is that, if you're an Australian citizen, you get sentenced by the courts, you do the time and then you come back out into the community. You're given an opportunity to rebuild your life. Some people don't. They reoffend. They're dealt with again by the justice system, and back into prison they go. But, for this group of people, it's a different regime entirely because they're foreigners. You understand: we are a xenophobic Senate. We deal with foreigners differently than we deal with Australians. But, when this group of people are convicted and sentenced by the courts under our Constitution—which makes it clear that the power to punish is reserved only for the courts, and not for politicians—they are imprisoned, and then, when they come out of prison, they are thrown into indefinite immigration detention. They are punished twice for the same crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indefinite immigration detention, we now know, was never lawful; the detainees were unlawfully detained by the government—punished twice, with the second punishment unlawful. Now, the Labor and Liberal parties want to punish them a third time, and the only reason they can be punished a third time is because they are not Australian citizens. If another country was doing this to Australian citizens abroad, the Labor and Liberal Parties would be up in arms about it. But because it is Australia doing it to a bunch of refugees and people who sought asylum in this country, that is okay by the Labor and Liberal parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we go again, as I've said, a range of offences is created by this legislation, some of which have mandatory sentencing attached to them. I'll remind all Labor members in this place that mandatory sentencing is starkly contrary to Labor Party policy. I mean, I have to ask: What is the point of being a member of the Labor Party? They go through all these conferences—these big events—they generate policy, and their senators and MPs just come into this place and ignore it. I tell you what, you wouldn't get away with that in our party, and rightly so. We would be held to account if Greens senators and MPs acted in this way, but the Labor Party is quite happy to give the finger to its members because it has no respect for its members and no respect for its own policy. The only thing it has respect for is Mr Dutton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a lot about community safety in this debate. Make no mistake, Labor's position on the bill is not about keeping our communities safe; it is actually about keeping the Labor Party safe from Mr Dutton. That is what we are dealing with here—a confected emergency, spun out of thin air by Mr Dutton, the toadies in News Corp magnifying it, happily reporting the opposition's lies, and the Labor Party on script, on brand, cravenly capitulating at the first available opportunity. They've not only handed over the power to draft legislation to Mr Dutton; they have handed over chamber management responsibilities today to Mr Dutton. It beggars belief that the Labor Party would have so little pride and so little backbone that they would be prepared to allow Mr Dutton to run roughshod over them in this fashion. This is a dark, dark day for the Senate and, tragically, we know how this is going to end. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  This Labor government is an omnishambles. It is an omnishambles on steroids because what we have seen under this Labor government is a government that is prepared to sit around the cabinet table but which is not prepared to take the tough decisions to keep Australians safe, because the Commonwealth government has one job. Its main job is to keep Australia safe and to keep Australians safe. But under this government, under this omnishambles-on-steroids government, we've seen released rapists, murderers, paedophiles and a contract killer. So the question you would put to Australia is: Do you feel safer today than you did a month ago or 18 months ago? Because this Labor government is continuing in the 'proud' tradition—and I use 'proud' in inverted commas—of previous Labor governments of being weak at protecting Australians when it comes to securing our borders. Remember that it was under the previous Labor that we had over 50,000 illegal arrivals come to this country by boat. We had thousands die at sea because of the previous Labor government, and now we have cabinet ministers whose arrogance is only exceeded by their incompetence. Their incompetence and their failure to understand how to run their departments and how to keep Australians safe has now put at risk Australians.</span>

He is someone who has come to Canberra to keep Australians safe, bringing the skills he learned as a Queensland police officer. And what did Labor ministers call Mr Dutton?

We'll proudly, as we have done this afternoon, bring on this legislation for debate because we want Australia to be safe. We want Australians to be safe.

                    </a>  Sorry; it is astounding the way Labor has delivered government and political direction to Mr Peter Dutton and his mates over there. It is just an astounding national surrender, not only to surrender the direction of government to the coalition, led by Mr Peter Dutton, but to attach onto this noxious legislation two of the most appalling provisions that offend pretty much every legal principle in the book.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one is future crime, also called preventive detention. The second one is mandatory sentencing. They are two things that Labor, in opposition and even as recently as in their 2023 national platform, rejected and said are offensive to the legal system and have the impact of reducing the independence of the judiciary. They are two things that Labor said, in opposition and even as recently as in the 2023 national platform they adopted, they'd never do. And now, as they follow on meekly behind Mr Peter Dutton and the coalition, with their heads bowed in political surrender to the coalition, they're putting both those things in the one piece of legislation, which is targeted overwhelmingly at refugees. You couldn't make up a bigger political surrender, a bigger moral surrender, a bigger surrender of principles than what Labor is doing with this legislation, the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Did I mention that they gave the whip hand to the coalition throughout all this? We're only having this debate now because they just collapsed; they wilted in the face of the slightest pressure from the coalition in the chamber today. They wilted like a lettuce leaf on a hot lawn. That's Labor and its principles when the coalition and Mr Peter Dutton just press their buttons—utterly pathetic!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is wrong with preventive detention, better known as future crime? One of the key problems is that that's not what our courts are designed to do. In our legal system, courts are designed to find out what happened in the past and determine matters of fact. Never, until Labor and the coalition started experimenting with it in the last two decades, did courts and our legal system engage in predicting future crime. It's just not what our courts do. It's not their fact-finding mission. They don't have skills and they don't have legal structures to enable them to work out future crime. You can hear this said by senior members of the judiciary both current and retired.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the tool that the Commonwealth has been using to predict future crime and handing up to judges as though it's actually credible? It's called VERA-2R. It is some kind of assessment matrix that was initially an international design. The VERA-2R model is partly funded by Home Affairs—that home of Pezzullo integrity! It is funded by Home Affairs, promulgated and handed out by Home Affairs and tended to courts by Home Affairs. VERA-2R is this assessment tool of our future crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we know about VERA-2R—the thing that, no doubt, is going to be relied upon by Home Affairs and the Commonwealth DPP when they're trying to keep people in jail under this new, preventive detention regime? The VERA-2R report has been found to be grossly wanting. There is a previously secret review of VERA-2R called the Corner report, commissioned by Home Affairs and done by Dr Emily Corner and Dr Helen Taylor. Home Affairs had the report for months and months and refused to give it to courts, because it was inconvenient for them—misleading courts. The Corner report, paid for by the Commonwealth government, reviewed VERA-2R and another even more flawed tool called Radar in detail and said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The lack of evidence underpinning both instruments has potentially serious implications for their validity and reliability. Without a strong theoretical and empirical basis for factor inclusion, it is not reasonable to anticipate that the instruments are able to predict their specified risk with anything other than chance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no better than a guess as to whether anybody who is covered by this preventive detention regime is likely to commit a future offence. It's just pure guessing. The tool that's used by the Commonwealth in doing this is a joke. It's a joke, except it has real-life impacts, because they come up with this matrix, they go up through the VERA-2R assessment tool and—pop!—out pops a number. If it's over a certain level, they say, 'Oh, well then that person is at risk of future offending, and they should be kept in jail.' You may as well just roll a dice. If it's four, five or six, you stay in jail, and if it's one, two or three, you get out. That's what the VERA-2R assessment tool is. It's no better than rolling a dice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it any wonder that the legal system says, 'Actually, this degrades us'? Making them guess based upon grossly flawed assessment tools about whether or not someone is going to commit a future offence degrades the judiciary. It brings into disrepute the legal system. But, because Labor is so spineless, it is just signing on to preventive detention. They're scared about a Ray Hadley rant or a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph </span>rant. Whatever the coalition wants, Labor will deliver—and they will deliver it quickly and fast, because they just want to be done with this. If they have to put a couple of people in jail for the rest of their lives, even though there's no evidence about future offending, well, Labor are willing to pay that price. Labor will keep a couple of people in jail forever based on a flawed tool and broken legal reasoning because they want to get out of a political mess. They haven't got the spine to stare down the coalition's scare tactics. That's what's happening here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we get to mandatory sentencing. If the future-crimes abuse of the legal system isn't enough—did I mention the use of the Pezzullo-credible VERA-2R assessment tool?—Labor has decided to go the coalition's extra beat-up-on-refugees step. That is to put in mandatory sentencing. Labor's own 2023 national platform said, 'Mandatory sentencing is wrong in principle and wrong in practice.' You said you wouldn't do it, because it removes judicial discretion, erodes the independence of the judiciary and provides unfair outcomes. That's what you say on the national platform, delivered, apparently, by Labor Party members across the country. It was signed off just a few months ago. But, of course, the parliamentary Labor Party don't feel constrained in any way by the principles of their party members, and they just come in here, sell their members, the national conference and the public down the river, and whack in mandatory sentencing. They are willing to put people in jail for a guaranteed year if they're late back home by 15 minutes one night. Those people will go to jail for a year, with no discretion. If you're home late by 15 minutes, you will be subject to mandatory sentencing and will go to jail for a year. This is brought to you by the Labor Party as the subcontractors of the coalition—the wholly owned subsidiary of the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why not just open a sort of Liberal-light branch and have a quiet rule in the next Labor Party national conference, with a little asterisk at the top, saying, 'Whatever we say here, if Mr Peter Dutton puts the heat on us, we'll just junk it'? You should have that little asterisk and exemption on the next national platform: 'Whatever our principles and whatever we say in the election or in opposition, if Mr Peter Dutton puts a blowtorch on us, we'll just junk it.' Just be honest, because that's what's happening here. This is a gross surrender of principle, it's a gross surrender of political direction and it's one of the worst examples of government I've seen.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I too stand to make a contribution on the really important Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023 but, most particularly, to once again draw the attention of those listening in the Australian public to what an absolute shambles this government has made of the most important job that it has, and that is managing our national security and keeping Australians safe. What we've seen on complete, utter and full display over these last few weeks is the fact that this government is just not up to being a government, to keeping Australians safe or to managing our national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that Justice Gleeson belled the cat some months ago about the fact that it was highly likely that the prospects for the defendants in this case were not going to be very good, the government were caught completely flat-footed and surprised when all of a sudden they got the decision that they did. So, in a kneejerk reaction, without bothering to seek advice to understand what the actual decision of the High Court really meant and go through it to make sure that they didn't take any actions that potentially could be adverse, the government, as I said, completely wet the bed and let in excess of 100 serious criminals out into our community. A cohort that included murderers, paedophiles, rapists and even a contract killer were let free into our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that on 14 November, following the NZYQ case, Ministers O'Neil and Giles said in a joint statement that the released detainees 'have been subject to a range of strict, mandatory visa conditions'. We know that's simply not true, because all of those conditions had no means of being enforced. You can say what you like but, if you don't have the mechanism to make sure it actually happens, the conditions are not worth the paper that they're written on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's incompetence continued well past this. First of all, the first duty of government is obviously to keep Australians safe. The government failed in its first attempt to put any legislation into this place, because it clearly didn't go far enough. They said that they'd never written laws that were this tough, yet within a matter of minutes, when it was drawn to their attention that there actually were a whole heap of other things that they could do that were tougher—boom, boom—those things got done. If the government had been prepared when it was told in June what was before it—that the prospects were that it would lose the High Court case—it could have taken action then. The people we're talking about now are in our community and already committing crimes, in breach of their release orders and visa conditions. They're already doing it, only a matter of minutes after they were let out of detention. The government could have prevented this happening by actually being prepared and putting in place the legislation for a preventive detention regime in the first place. This is something that the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Paterson, here in the chamber, Senator Cash and Mr Tehan, in the other place, have all been calling for—a preventive detention regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that the government has been caught out not always telling the truth. We know that Minister O'Neil said that the reason they hadn't done any work in relation to being prepared for the decision when it came down was that they had advice that they would win. We know that that is absolutely not the case, because Justice Gleeson made it very clear some months ago that they should be preparing for the worst and that their prospects weren't good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to explain, not to us in this place but to the general public, why it overreacted and released over 140 detainees, when clearly the decision applied only to the plaintiff NZYQ. The High Court's ruling—if you bother actually to analyse it—was quite narrow. We have an absolutely hopeless Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and a hopeless Minister for Home Affairs, but they need to face up to the Australian public and tell them why they released these people into the community. So far it seems to have been: 'Nothing to see here. We take no responsibility. We haven't done anything wrong.' Somehow, it's all a decision of the High Court, when the advice states that the High Court decision could quite easily have been contained to the specific circumstances of NZYQ. If it had been, many of these other offenders would not be out in our community at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the federal government who've been asleep at the wheel. Yesterday in my home state of South Australia we saw the terrible situation where a woman was sexually assaulted by one of the detainees who had been released. We've seen the South Australian Premier and the South Australian minister for police not really take responsibility. They've just said it's all the federal government's problem. Can I commend the shadow minister for police in South Australia, Sam Telfer, who has time and time again called on the South Australian government to take responsibility for the detainees that have been released into our South Australian community. Mr Telfer said in a press release that we cannot have 'a situation where hardened criminals with potentially dangerous backgrounds' that have been freed from detention 'are "just on the loose" in South Australia and the community is not told'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unbelievable. The interesting thing is that the assistant police commissioner went on to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… South Australian police were notified when Mr Yawari entered South Australia and they received alerts from the AFP and the ABF when detainees crossed borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And here's what he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We in South Australia, visit all of them. We go face to face. We meet them. We verify their identity and welcome them to South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my question is to the Premier, Peter Malinauskas, and the police minister, Joe Szakacs: are you welcoming these sorts of people into my home state? I would like to know if that's what you consider your duty of responsibility, in looking after the citizens of South Australia—that you 'welcome' rapists, paedophiles, murderers and even, potentially, a contract killer, should they decide to visit South Australia? You are going to welcome them into South Australia? It is quite extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the opposition leader in South Australia, the shadow minister in South Australia, asking questions about this, and yet all we have received so far from the government have been quite flippant responses. Only last week, on 28 November, Mr Telfer, the shadow police minister, asked a question of Mr Szakacs, as the Minister for Police, Emergency Services and Correctional Services: 'Are there any community safety risks to South Australia due to the recent immigration detainee released by the federal government?' And guess what Mr Szakacs's response was? 'It's got nothing to do with us. It's not the fault of the federal government. It's all the High Court's decision.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a situation here where we have six detainees in South Australia—despite the fact that last Tuesday Mr Szakacs thought that there were only five—who've been released from federal detention as a result of the decision and are here in South Australia. But what Mr Szakacs went on to say—and I'll read it into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—in response to these questions was: 'In any case, no matter the individual, no matter the way they find themselves in South Australia'—et cetera, et cetera—'they are subject to the laws of this state. The laws of this state are applied by the South Australian police. They do so in a very profound way. They do so in a very good way. And I can give the member for Flinders and his question the assurance that the South Australian police force continues to keep our community safe, no matter who you are and which manner you find yourself in South Australia.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'd say to you, Mr Szakacs: why don't you go and say that to the woman who was the victim of Mr Yawari's attack in South Australia? This attack has now required this detainee to be returned to detention. I would say to the South Australian government: you can't wash your hands of your responsibility for looking after Australian citizens. And, if the police minister actually thinks that it's okay to welcome these people into South Australia, and if the police minister thinks that everybody in South Australia is safe because of that, he clearly is very much mistaken, as we've seen by the terrible news reports of what happened in South Australia this week.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, which now includes amendments to both the Migration Act and the Criminal Code, complements and further strengthens the amendments previously introduced to parliament. It builds on and reinforces the measures passed by the parliament on 16 November. These measures are only necessary because of the mess the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, made of the home affairs portfolio while he had carriage of it in the former government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we don't forget how we got to this place. We got here because the High Court found that a detention regime that was implemented by Mr Dutton as minister was unconstitutional and unlawful. We got here because Mr Dutton failed to resettle any of the former detainees, who have now been released in line with the High Court orders. We got here because Mr Dutton intervened to allow the plaintiff in the High Court case to apply for another visa. We got here after a month of politics from Mr Dutton—politics rather than protecting the community. We saw only last week Mr Dutton and the coalition vote against laws that we as the government introduced that sought to strengthen this regime. But, instead of backing that extra layer of protection, Mr Dutton and the coalition voted with the Greens against those amendments only last week. That is how we got here—after a series of failures by Mr Dutton and the coalition over Mr Dutton's period as the home affairs minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Mr Dutton tries to blame the Albanese government for his own failures. We all remember that person at school who you were listed to do a group assignment with and who tells you for years, for weeks or for months that they've contributed their bit of the assignment, and then you find out on the day that the assignment is due that they haven't done anything. That is the situation we found with Mr Dutton. There were years of claims made by Mr Dutton that he had done this and done that and that he was this tough and that tough. Now we find out—now that he is not the Minister for Home Affairs anymore—that his entire migration system and his entire detention system was an absolute ruse that didn't stand up in court. That is how we got here. Let's not buy any of this nonsense from the opposition that this is the Albanese government's fault. The responsibility for this mess lies firmly at the feet not just of the coalition but of Mr Dutton himself. We need to remember that, as we in the Albanese government fix this mess and make these laws go through—making strong laws stronger, making strict laws stricter and making tough laws tougher. That's what we are doing with the legislation to fix Mr Dutton's mess.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically this package strengthens the already robust laws that have been introduced to ensure the protection of the community by introducing new powers for the courts to impose community safety orders where there is substantial admissible evidence of a high risk to the community from people who have previously committed a serious, violent or sexual offence. This judicially supervised scheme includes a mechanism to detain, or impose additional conditions on, noncitizens who pose an unacceptable risk to the community but who have no real prospect of being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 November, the High Court determined that plaintiff NZYQ's detention was unlawful 'by reason of their having been, and continuing to be, no real prospect of the removal of the plaintiff from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future'. The government recognises and respects the constitutional jurisprudence of the High Court of Australia, which is reflected in this scheme. What we are proposing is modelled on the high-risk terrorist offenders scheme established under the former coalition government. Indeed it is precisely the sort of scheme that Liberal and National MPs and senators have been calling for. Above all, the proposed scheme reflects the expectations of the Australian community that all lawful mechanisms available to a government should be utilised to ensure community safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has already put in place a number of stringent visa conditions to manage risks to the community posed by certain noncitizens in response to the High Court's decision. These conditions underpin the ability to manage the NZYQ cohort in the community, and new powers support monitoring and compliance with the conditions. The government will continue to review these arrangements to ensure they remain fit for purpose, and we have committed to developing further amendments as required to ensure the ongoing safety of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the greatest country in the world, and for decades we have welcomed waves of migrants who have made Australia home. Australians rightly expect to live in safety in the community, and the proposed package of amendments I am moving today focus on an assessment of the risk posed by a person who has been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence, and on a determination to be made by the minister for immigration as to whether or not the strict conditions that can be imposed through our visa framework are sufficient to effectively manage that risk. Where the minister forms the view that the strict visa conditions available under the Migration Act may not effectively manage the risk to the community, the proposed amendments provide an option for the minister to approach the courts to seek the imposition of a community safety order. The application to the court must be supported by substantial admissible evidence of the high risk the noncitizen poses to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear. A community safety order would be made by a court, not the minister. Reflecting on the High Court's decision, the making of a community safety order would be—as it must be—a judicial decision, not an administrative decision. Under the amendments moved here today, a community safety order can be either a community safety detention order—that is, preventive detention—or a community safety supervision order. This would, in effect, allow for the making of an order that most effectively manages the risk to the community appropriately and proportionately to the circumstances. A community safety detention order will be used for the highest-risk individuals where the court determines that there are no viable conditions that could effectively manage the risk posed by the individual if they were in the community. Before making such an order, the court must be satisfied that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of seriously harming the community by committing a serious violent or sexual offence, and that there is no less restrictive measure that could effectively manage that risk. On the other hand, a community safety supervision order can be used to impose conditions on individuals where the court determines such conditions would effectively and appropriately manage the risk of the individual while they are in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before making a community safety supervision order, the court must be satisfied that each of the conditions, and the combined effect of all the conditions to be imposed on the offender by the order, are reasonably necessary, reasonably appropriate, and adapted for the purpose of protecting the community from serious harm by addressing the unacceptable risk of the offender committing a serious violent or sexual offence. The legislation must not specify or limit the conditions available to the court. Instead, it allows the court to tailor the order to the specific risk posed by the noncitizen to the community. Under this scheme, it is important to give the courts the flexibility to adapt the community safety supervision order conditions to the circumstances of each offender in order to support compliance, maintain proportionality and effectively protect the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments moved today also create offences for failing to comply with a community safety supervision order. Where a community safety supervision order is made, the order overrides all community protection related visa conditions previously imposed by the minister. In effect, those conditions are superseded by the decision of the courts. However, all national security and status-resolution related conditions would continue to remain valid and enforceable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the instance where the risk may not meet the threshold for applying to the courts for either of the community safety orders, the minister would have available the range of strict visa conditions, together with associated offences for breaching those conditions. These include, for example: conditions relating to monitoring and reporting; conditions related to contact with or proximity to minors; and conditions related to contact with a victim or their family. The bill retains criminal offences for breaching those conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the amendments being moved today, a community safety order could be made for up to three years, and successive orders could be sought. Under the new community safety orders and ministerially imposed visa condition schemes, a requirement for an annual review of the risk posed by the noncitizen has been included. In addition, the noncitizen can appeal a decision by the court through judicial review mechanisms, or via a review of visa conditions through administrative appeal. In effect, the arrangements can endure for as long as the risk remains. Under these laws, all restrictions on the individual's liberty, whether they are in detention or in the community, must be proportionate to the level of risk the noncitizen poses to the community. The amendments also provide law enforcement with the necessary powers to monitor an individual, subject to a community safety supervision order, to ensure the individual is complying with the conditions imposed on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that, as I say, at all times over the last few weeks through this debate the safety of the community has been the utmost priority for the Albanese government. Not playing politics but protecting individuals—that's what we're doing through this strong legislation. It's about time the opposition stopped the politics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I have to say on those last comments that, unfortunately, the only thing this government has done is play politics. Let's start with some of the comments that the minister has made in relation to NZYQ. Let's talk about the truth of NZYQ, who is the plaintiff in this matter and the person to whom the High Court decision actually applies. The coalition inherited from Labor 30,000 people who were put into the community on bridging visas. Why did that happen? Because our detention centres were full. Fifty thousand illegal maritime arrivals had arrived under the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We had a mess to clean up. We had to reintroduce temporary protection visas because—lo and behold!—the Labor government had abolished them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to clean up this mess that we inherited from the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government, it was a fact that, under migration law, assessments needed to be done on individual claims for protection. It was also a fact that you couldn't determine what to do with an individual until their status had been determined. In other words, you had to work out if they were found to be owed protection or not and whether they could be deported back to their country of origin. So, despite the rhetoric from the Labor Party today, at staged periods in time the minister did at law what he had to do and lifted the bar to allow a certain number of people to make this application to have their protection claims assessed. Just so everybody understands, this was not an issuing of a visa. Despite what the minister and Labor have been saying, there is a big difference. The bar was lifted, as we know, for large cohorts. We were dealing with 30,000 people who had been put into our community on bridging visitors because our detention centres were full. The minister did not deal with individual cases at this point in the process. It happens to be a fact that, without lifting the bar to enable people's claims to be assessed, we could not determine what to do with them. That is actually a legal fact. One of those potential options was deportation if they could be returned to their country of origin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is false to suggest—the Labor Party know this, but it doesn't stop them—that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, intervened to grant NZYQ a visa. That is just not true. The facts do not sustain what the Labor Party are saying. The Prime Minister, Minister O'Neil and Minister Giles, quite frankly, should be ashamed of themselves for trying to mislead the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without a doubt, though, these types of comments were an embarrassing attempt to try and distract from the complete incompetence of the Albanese Labor government when it comes to the handling of detainees being released into the community. This also happens to be a fact: NZYQ would not be in Australia were it not for Labor's failed border protection policy which allowed 50,000 arrivals on more than 800 boats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put on the record what actually happened despite what the minister and the Australian Labor Party have been misleading the public with. What did Mr Dutton, as the relevant minister at the time, actually do? He allowed a process to take place for those who had arrived under Labor. Remember that there were 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals, more than 1,200 dead at sea and thousands of children placed into detention because of the failed border protection policies of the previous Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Dutton allowed a process to take place, where those who arrived under Labor could apply to have their claims for protection assessed by the Department of Home Affairs, Immigration and Border Protection. Despite what Labor said, the fact remains there was no intervention and no visa was ever granted to this individual. Labor were either misleading the Australian public or, alternatively, perhaps they don't understand immigration law. NZYQ arrived, lo and behold, in September 2012 under the former Labor government. He arrived on a boat. He fell into the 13 August 2012 to 1 January 2014 fast-tracked cohort. We were cleaning up the mess left to us by the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. That fast-tracked cohort consisted of 24,500 illegal maritime arrivals and they all had the bar lifted en masse because, under that law, that is what the minister had to do. You couldn't determine what to do with an individual until their status had been determined; hence the minister had to lift the bar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cleaning up the mess even further, though, in 2015-16, the minister exercised these power on, lo and behold, 24,120 occasions, covering 23,014 non-citizens. So under sections 46A and 46B of the Immigration Act, the minister may exercise his powers to lift the legislative bar which prevents certain non-citizens from making an application for a visa. Where the minister exercises these powers, the minister specifics a class a visa for which the person may apply. So, again, despite everything that the Labor Party has been saying—clearly, desperate, no two ways about that, but they know that; that's life with the Australian Labor Party—they are quite happy to spread mistruths, as long as the mistruth fits the facts and the narrative that they want to tell. Let's not worry about what the actual facts say. In fact, God forbid the Australian people ever know what the actual facts are under this government, good grief. It is false to suggest, as I said, that Mr Dutton intervened to grant NZYQ's visa. He was cleaning up a mess left by the former Labor government in relation to the in excess of 50,000 people who had arrived here by boat. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have comments that I will make the next time I'm given the call in relation to an amendment that I will be moving. But in the first instance, Minister, assuming this bill is passed—and the coalition, as we have indicated, will be supporting this bill through the Senate—does the government have an indication of how many individuals released from detention as a result of the High Court decision will meet the threshold to be redetained or to have a supervision order applied?</span>

They seem to not appreciate the central point of the High Court judgement, which is that the decision as to the detention of one of these individuals is a matter that must be made by a court rather than by a minister, so it would be completely irresponsible to ignore the High Court ruling for me or any other minister to give the number of people who are expected to be covered by this regime, because we would then be getting back to exactly situation that existed under Mr Dutton as the minister, which was found to be unconstitutional and unlawful by the High Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole point of the decision of the High Court was that decisions as to the detention of these individuals must be made by a court rather than a minister. On a number of occasions over the last few days, in their desperate desire to score political points, the opposition have either wilfully ignored the High Court judgement or failed to understand it, and that is exactly the problem that got us where we are. The problem that we've had is either the former government's wilful ignorance of the law or their contempt for it and desire to override it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the number of people who are expected to be captured by this new regime, I'm not in a position to give that number, because that would be flying completely in the face of the High Court reasoning. What I can say is that the Department of Home Affairs will engage with law enforcement authorities in relation to each NZYQ decision-affected noncitizen who has committed serious violent or sexual offences to determine the risks they pose to the Australian community and consider making applications to the court for orders based on the available evidence. I'm sure Senator Cash is aware of the eligibility requirements for someone to be issued with one of these orders. I wouldn't expect that it would be every single individual in the cohort, but these sorts of orders could be made in relation to people who have, for example, committed serious, violent or sexual offences, and there are other eligibility criteria that need to be fulfilled before one of these orders can be sought by the minister or granted by a court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, this regime that we are putting forward is modelled very closely on the high-risk terrorist offender regime that the former coalition brought in. Just as that regime did not allow for the preventive detention of every single convicted terrorist offender or other category of offender—it applied to particular types of people rather than an entire cohort—I would expect similarly that a regime that here is based on and modelled on the coalition's regime for high-risk terrorist offenders would apply to some but not all of the people who have been released into the community as a result of the High Court decision.</span>

The question I asked was: how many in the cohort have committed a serious, violent or sexual crime that has a sentence of seven years of more attached to it? In other words, how many of the 147 rapists, paedophiles and murderers and the contract killer that you have let out of detention have committed a serious violent or sexual crime that has had a sentence of seven or more years attached to it as a maximum? You see, if you don't fall within the first limb, you don't even make it to the second.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That now gives me an opportunity to talk about the amendment that we will be moving for this exact reason. The amendment that we are moving is a straightforward amendment. It is about being straight with the Australian people, because, quite frankly, that is what they deserve. But, based on that last decision from the minister, there's nothing to see here. We don't even know how many of the 147 fit within the first limb of our test. I hate to tell the Australian people this, but if you're not in the first limb of the test—guess what?—you're out; the preventive detention order does not apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are entitled to know who is being released into their communities. The fact of the matter is: at this point in time, we only know the tip of the iceberg. We know that the government has released paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer. Who else? Who are the serious criminals the government has decided to release? Let's be clear: every one of those released from detention was released because of a decision by this government, and the overwhelming majority were released before we had even seen the High Court's reasons. It was a knee-jerk, panicked response, and for the vast majority we don't know what they've done or why the government released them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is worse is that, based on the answer to my question, the minister himself doesn't know—good grief! The government doesn't know, of the 147 they've released into the community, how many are going to even make it into the first limb. The first limb is very important. I would have thought the minister, perhaps at the instruction of the Prime Minister, would have already done an assessment of the 147. How many of those 147 even meet the first-step threshold the government is putting in place? Is the answer zero? I don't know; the minister hasn't told me. Maybe the answer is zero. Is it three? Is it four? We don't know. That is the basic question we would like the government to ask in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amendment, in terms of what I will have to now move, that will require the government to tell us. It is very simple. It accords with the standard the government has set for itself. This government talks a lot about openness and transparency, but, I have to say, it doesn't talk the talk, unfortunately. If the government is prepared to live by the standard it set itself, it will support the amendment the coalition is putting forward. As I said, it's very simple. Our amendment will require the minister to prepare a statement of reasons for every detainee whom they decide to release as a result of the NZYQ case; that is currently at 147. It says the minister should prepare that statement and then table it within the parliament within seven days. It's pretty simple. When Minister Giles decides to release someone, he should tell Australians why. The only thing the government has said to date is, 'Oh, it's because of the High Court and the decision in the High Court.' Seriously? Tell us how the High Court decision applies to each of the 147 that you have released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister should be clear about the visa that has been granted. He should explain to the Australian people what conditions have been imposed. He should reveal their visa history. He should be upfront about the character concerns of the person who, like the 147, is currently living in the Australian community. The Australian public are entitled to know about their past convictions both here in Australia and overseas, and the minister should set out in detail the basis on which he determined there was no real prospect that the person would be removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future—which is the NZYQ case. Under our amendment we're going to help the government help the Australian people understand why they are doing what they are doing. Under our amendment we would learn whether or not the incompetence displayed by the Albanese government in the NZYQ case is a pattern of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's reflect on what happened in that case. The government, as I said, made two concessions. It conceded two important facts, and that terminology—'important facts'—is not mine; it is from the High Court itself. The court put significant weight on those two important facts the government conceded on 30 May. The first concession was that NZYQ could not be removed from Australia. The second concession made by the government was that there was no real prospect of the plaintiff being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. The government made those concessions in May, lo and behold, even though they hadn't actually finished making inquiries about whether or not he could be resettled. One might ask: why in God's name would the government have made those concessions? The Labor government made those concessions as at 30 May. But then we get the High Court reasons, and this is what they reveal. When they realised the magnitude of their stuff-up in August, they then started making inquiries with Five Eyes partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, for the record: this is what happened under this incompetent government. They conceded that there was no way NZYQ was ever going to be removed from Australia, because no-one would take him. After making that concession, which forced the court's hand, they decided to go back and check. Maybe this case would have been entirely unnecessary. Maybe the result could have been avoided. Was this a pattern of behaviour? Did they do this in other cases? I don't know. The Australian people don't know. But I can tell you from the feedback I've been getting into my office and from reading comments online across all the newspapers, the Australian people would like to know: how many people were released without even checking if other countries would take them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's see if this government can meet the commitment to transparency and openness that it loves to trumpet—a commitment, I might say, that has only ever been honoured in the breach. Australians know that in the ordinary course they will struggle to get information out of this conniving, secretive, hypocritical government. Let's hope the events of the last four weeks have made them see the error of their ways. I hope they understand how badly they have lost the trust of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again to the Australian Labor Party: we are giving you an opportunity. Once again, we are here to help you, just like we were on your last piece of legislation. We proposed six amendments, even though you said it couldn't be done, which you accepted. We are once again cleaning up your mess. We are giving you the opportunity to work with us, to make sure the people who are being asked to bear this risk—the Australian people—actually understand what and who is coming down the line. They need to know who is being released. So the question is, will the government support our very simple amendment? Or are you basically saying 'stuff you' to the Australian people? Are you saying, 'We will not tell you what we have done'? Are you saying, 'We are prepared to expose you to a risk'? In fact, given the last 48 hours, I would think it's a pretty significant risk: allegations of a serious sexual assault and then allegations in relation to a minor. But they're not prepared to tell you about the risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I ask the minister: how many in the cohort will fit into the first limb of the test the government has set out for itself?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I refer to my earlier answer, in which I made very clear a point Senator Cash continues to not seem to appreciate, which is that we got to this mess because Mr Dutton and the coalition implemented an unconstitutional and unlawful detention regime in which the then minister, Mr Dutton, decided who was detained and who was not. That is exactly what the High Court has found to be unconstitutional and unlawful. The regime that we're putting in place will leave it to the court to make that decision. Senator Cash can ask as many times as she likes how many people this will apply to, but I'm not going to give a number, because that is exactly the problem we are trying to fix—ministers dictating these terms rather than courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Senator Cash and the coalition have a long history of believing governments can operate outside the law. We saw that with robodebt, and we saw the consequences of that. But this government will follow the law and we will follow the High Court reasoning, whatever we might think of it, and we will deliver laws that do stand up in court. For that reason, I'm not going to be any more specific about this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During that contribution Senator Cash moved some amendments, so I might just take the opportunity to put the government's position on the record. We will be opposing Senator Cash's amendments, because, simply put, they are unworkable. We appreciate that there is a desire for transparency around the operation of this regime. That is why I refer Senator Cash to clause 395.49 in the amendments, which requires the immigration minister to, as soon as practicable after each 30 June, cause a report to be prepared about the operation of this new division, which sets up the preventive detention regime and the community safety order regime, during the year ended on that 30 June. The clause in the amendments gives some level of detail about what that report must include. This is an annual report that will need to be tabled by the immigration minister to provide a level of transparency around the operation of this regime. Subsection 2 of the clause says that report must include the number of each of the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) applications for each kind of community safety order made during the year;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) each kind of community safety order made during the year;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(c) applications for review of each kind of community safety order made by serious offenders during the year;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(d) applications for review of each kind of community safety order made by the Immigration Minister, or a legal representative of the Immigration Minister, during the year;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(e) each kind of community safety order affirmed during the year; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(f) each kind of community safety order varied during the year; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(g) community safety orders revoked (including by operation of this Act) during the year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the very amendments that we are moving require an appropriate level of transparency from the immigration minister each and every year about the operation of this regime, but they do so in a workable manner that won't jeopardise, for example, the potential resettlement of some of these individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my earlier contribution, one of the reasons we are in this situation is that, the entire time he was the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton failed to resettle any of these individuals. We know that the former government had a policy of not taking up the resettlement deal that was on offer from New Zealand, for example. That belligerence and that refusal to work with other countries around resettlement is one of the reasons some of these individuals remain in detention. We don't want to jeopardise that by providing some of the information that Senator Cash's amendments require. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will take you through the Senator Cash's amendments. Proposed section 76G(1)(a) and (b) in her amendments would cover only those visas granted between 8 November, being the date of the High Court decision, and 18 November, which is the commencement date for the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions) Act 2023. Proposed section 76G(1)(c) would cover all grants under regulations 2.25AA and BB. I noted that regulation 2.25AA existed prior to NZYQ, and this provision could be interpreted so as to apply to any visa ever granted under regulation under 2.25AA, noting that that provision was inserted in 2013 and has been used for noncitizens outside the NZYQ cohort. Proposed section 76G(2)(f) requires the minister to table information about the basis on which there is no real prospect of removal. There are legitimate concerns that the minister being required to provide information about the potential refoulement of a noncitizen or the noncitizen's protection claims could further jeopardise removal efforts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, one of the problems that we're dealing with at the moment is the failure of Mr Dutton to resettle any of these individuals that we're talking about. The last thing we want to do is jeopardise the potential future resettlement of any of these individuals by requiring the minister to provide information which could jeopardise those removal efforts. Similarly, providing details of how and why a person cannot be removed would have potential adverse impacts on the relationship between Australia and relevant countries who have been approached and/or the noncitizen's home country. This could also prejudice future negotiations on issues, including on returns, and it could also affect Australia's international relations. Proposed section 76G(3) provides that the statement—that Senator Cash's amendments require—must not include personal details about the noncitizen. However, the breadth of information required to be given under 76G(2) would be so broad as to easily enable the identification of the noncitizen. For example, the person's immigration history would presumably include previous dates of entry and departure from Australia. These significant issues with releasing information that would potentially identify them may therefore constitute a breach of the Privacy Act requirements. Listing country of origin or citizenship is sensitive because some are from very small countries, but for some the nature of the crime and other elements being specified by the opposition would also potentially allow for the identification of the person being released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for these reasons that we'll be opposing the amendments. We're trying to strike the right balance in terms of transparency by requiring the immigration minister to table that annual report that's required under clause 395.49, but we think it would be impracticable and unworkable and could jeopardise future removal efforts if we were to agree to the amendments being moved by Senator Cash.</span>

It does not tell the Australian community about the risks they will need to live with—because that is the fact: the Australian community are living with these risks.

But I'm advised that policy design work on this matter began before the High Court decision was handed down and before the High Court reasons were handed down. I'd have to take on notice the precise date for drafting instructions, but it's also worth remembering that this bill has been prepared in stages. The bill that we're debating tonight contains the amendments that were passed in the House of Representatives last week despite the opposition of the opposition and the Greens, who voted together to stop us making those laws stronger. Now, of course, we are adding to that the community safety order regime. I suspect what we will find when I come back to you is that drafting instructions were issued at different periods of time because the bill has been prepared in stages. I think it would be reasonable to think that the drafting instructions that set up the strengthening of the laws that went through the House of Representatives last week probably were issued before the drafting instructions for the community safety order regime.</span>

I am happy to come back to you on notice about the date that the drafting instructions were issued for the community safety order regime, but it would be reasonable to expect that final drafting instructions were issued after the High Court reasons, because it was necessary to have those reasons in order to make sure that this regime was constitutional.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has, in a couple of other cases, been brought before the courts well before this. One was the Chu Kheng Lim case, and there was also a case in 2004 where the courts held that you can't keep people in detention for an unlimited period of time if they can't practicably and reasonably be relocated or sent back in the foreseeable future.</span>

To sit here and listen to you accuse Peter Dutton, the previous Minister for Home Affairs, for what happened with this man is completely misleading the people and this parliament.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  Thanks, Senator Hanson. We're just trying to get an answer to your specific question, but I have to disagree with your assessment of the situation. What I think you've just argued is that, because of an earlier judgement—I'm not sure which judgement or which year it was in—a judge apparently, according to you, cast some doubt on whether it was legal to indefinitely detain these people, and you're saying that because of those previous comments this government should have known that it wouldn't win this case. I can't really see how that puts Mr Dutton in a better position, because he and his government were in power for 10 years and followed the same practice that we followed for, as you put it, about a year before this case started. So, if you're saying that this government made the wrong call to comply with the earlier ruling of the High Court in the Al-Kateb decision—I think that's what it's called—back in 2004, then I would expect that you would be equally critical of Mr Dutton for having done exactly the same thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Be that as it may, we make no apologies for having opposed this case in the High Court. It was brought, as I say, this year. We argued that the individual involved should remain in detention. That had been the understanding of the Australian law for at least 20 years, through both Mr Dutton's period in office and our 12 months or so before the case started, and we continued to argue that it was lawful to hold this individual in detention. The High Court, obviously, found a different way and they overturned that judgement from about 20 years ago. So, given we're a government that complies with the law, we've now followed the law and released that individual and the other people who were caught up in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure that it's wise for me to give you the names of countries that were approached about the potential resettlement of this plaintiff. What I can say is that there were about six different countries that, since we came into government, we approached to resettle this individual. I haven't been advised of this, but I take it that the answer in each case was no. I can't speak to what efforts were made by Mr Dutton or the coalition to resettle this individual when they were in power, but what we do know is that when they lost office these 147 people had not been resettled. What we also know is that the former government rejected the offer of resettlement that New Zealand had put on the table for a whole bunch of different people. Perhaps, if they hadn't been so belligerent about that, we wouldn't be in this situation.</span>

I know that is an unusual situation in Australia, because we did have a government that operated outside the boundaries of the law—for example, with robodebt—but this government takes the law seriously and complies with the law. The High Court made a decision that was about one individual and their case, but the decision that they made applied to other people in the same circumstance. If we hadn't released those people, we would be facing claims for compensation for unlawfully detaining those people. I know you've often got a lot to say about wasting taxpayers' money, and I don't think it would be a great idea to waste taxpayers' money paying compensation to people who are illegally detained. That's what we would have been doing if we had ignored the High Court ruling and continued to detain those people.</span>

I don't think that has been said by anyone, so I don't know if that's right or not. Secondly, on your point about resettling people in New Zealand, you would find—and I'm happy to get you the numbers—that, since this government came to power, reached an agreement with the New Zealand government and took up the offer of the New Zealand government to resettle people who were in detention, we have successfully done that. New Zealand has accepted people who were previously detained in Australia but whose cases the former government wasn't prepared to take up.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  The people that were resettled in New Zealand were probably not criminals—not to the same extent as those you have released. You never even waited. After the High Court decision was handed down, you never waited to see what the determination was and the full reasons for their decision. That came nearly two weeks later. You acted to release these people into our society, knowing that they were criminals. You have made it unsafe for a lot of people, and the Australian people are concerned about who is now living amongst them. We've seen the cases of the ones who have now been caught because they have committed crimes. Since you released these people from the detention centres, the parliament passed a law that they should wear ankle bracelets. But isn't it funny that a few of them said, 'We're not wearing them'? One actually absconded; he's gone. Another three refused to put them on. Yet what happened to them? Why weren't they held? Why weren't they detained? The law says that they should wear the ankle bracelets. You put that in there. That was an agreement between the government and the opposition, and I supported it. But no. You released them into society without the ankle bracelets. You're really worried about the Australian people, aren't you?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I don't understand now is the decision by the High Court and your inaction in relation to making sure that society was safe after you released these people. Minister, where does this now leave us? Because of your inaction, we've now got numerous boats coming across to Australia. One has landed on our shores. I know that other boats are being turned back. One boat has landed with 12 people in it claiming refugee status in Australia. Will the High Court ruling now impact those people? How long will you be able to keep them in detention—until we rule whether they are really refugees or economic refugees, whether they are of good character, have jailable sentences or are criminals? What do you intend to do about this? If they are of the same character as the others, what is now going to happen to these illegal boat people who, under your government, are going to cost us billions of dollars? Are you in the same boat—pardon the pun—where you cannot contain them for an unreasonable amount of time?</span>

First, our government remains absolutely committed to the policies underpinning Operation Sovereign Borders. Of the small number of people who have attempted to come to Australia by boat since we were elected, each of those people is either awaiting return in Nauru, has been taken to Nauru or has been taken back to their home country. To suggest otherwise is not true. In fact, this government has invested more in Operation Sovereign Borders than we saw under the coalition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Your question really goes to whether this High Court decision will apply in some way to people who seek to come to Australia by boat. Again, they're completely different concepts. This High Court decision is about a relatively small group of detainees, people who had already come to Australia but, for one reason or another, were not able to be taken back to their home country in the reasonably foreseeable future. It was about the decision of governments to detain those people indefinitely. That's a particular category of people that is different to anyone who seeks to come to Australia by boat. As I say, this government's policy is that anyone who seeks to come to Australia by boat will be either turned back or taken to Nauru.</span>

You're right; the scheme that's being proposed is limited to those who have been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence and pose an unacceptable risk of harm to the community by committing such a crime again. An assessment of the risk that an individual poses under this regime is based on expert evidence from relevant officials such as psychologists and psychiatrists with experience dealing with serious sex and violent offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a significant and well-developed body of research that has guided the development of assessment tools relating to violent and sexual conduct which have been utilised in similar regimes by the states and other countries. It's the intention of the Commonwealth to work with jurisdictions on the implementation of the proposed regime, including by identifying appropriate risk assessment tools. There are a number of state and territory regimes for the preventive detention of violent and sexual offenders, as well as a number of international examples. That's why the Commonwealth will work with states and territories and international partners to understand their experiences using risk assessment tools and expert evidence. There are existing tools for violent and sexual offenders which can be used to guide an expert assessment of their probability of reoffending and to determine what type of intervention approach would be most appropriate. The Commonwealth will closely engage with practitioners and experts to determine the most accurate and appropriate tools to use.</span>

Having gone through this charade of rushing everything through, are you suggesting that, while it's still warm on the photocopier, you're then going to engage in some form of consultation process with the states and foreign jurisdictions to find out which risk assessment instrument you're going to use, or is the truth of the matter that you're going to be using the VERA-2R assessment tool and you just don't want to say it? Is that the actual truth? Surely you can't be saying that you're going to rush the legislation through and then sit down and consult with Albania about what tools they use. That can't seriously be the government's position. So are you going to be using the VERA-2R tool? If you're not going to be using the VERA-2R tool, tell us which tool you are going to use for risk assessments under this legislation.</span>

I know the Greens opposed the legislation that we initially introduced and passed here last time we sat. I made the point that, in opposing that legislation, the Greens seemed not to be concerned with community safety. I would have thought that the fact that we have now seen three of these individuals be either arrested or charged with new offences would have underlined the importance of passing this legislation as quickly as possible to keep the community safe. I don't know what other evidence the Greens party requires that would demonstrate the urgent need to introduce this legislation. Whether assessment tools have been finalised or whether they are days away from being finalised, that shouldn't get in the way of this parliament putting in place a legislative regime that is designed to keep the Australian community safe, especially since we are approaching the end of the parliamentary year. In this government's view, there is no time to waste, and that's why we've been keen to get this legislation passed as quickly as possible. But, if the Greens party want to see a situation go on where we don't have a preventive detention regime or community safety orders regime in place and if they're content to see more reoffending by these individuals, then that's something you're going to have to justify to the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But your question relates specifically to the VERA-2R tool. Just before I come to that, there are tools that are used by states and territories overseas such as Static 99 and ARMS, and they have been proven to be valid and reliable in supporting professional assessments of reoffending potential. There's significantly more data in relation to violent and sexual offenders, compared with terrorist offenders, and that has supported the further development of these tools. In relation to the VERA-2R tool that you've asked about, as I'm sure you are aware, Senator Shoebridge, that is a structured professional judgement tool used in law enforcement, correctional and intervention program contexts in Australia and internationally to assess the likelihood of a person's risk of engaging in violent extremism. It's one of the tools that have been used and relied on by experts to assess individuals for division 105A proceedings under the existing high-risk terrorist offenders regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But VERA-2R is a tool adapted to assessing violent extremism and, whilst relevant in respect of terrorist related violence, it is not adapted to assessing the risk of the offender committing a serious violent or sexual offence. I think that you can read into that that it's not the intention to use that tool for this regime, given that tool is specifically designed for the assessment of risk of committing terrorist related violence. But, as I say, the Commonwealth will review all available tools and identify which are appropriate for use to support the community safety order regime. I really would have thought that recent days would have made the Greens party reconsider its position in saying that we don't need to get moving on this legislation.</span>

He's obviously entitled to his view, but this government does believe that the regime that we're putting in place is necessary to protect the Australian public, just as we supported the implementation of a high-risk terrorist offender preventive detention regime. Community safety orders are designed to ensure the protection of the community from a small category of noncitizens—that's what it's being used for in this legislation—and that is a category of people who have been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence. Similar regimes exist in the states and territories. The scheme is targeted at individuals who pose an unacceptable risk of harming the community by committing a serious violent or sexual offence and who are noncitizens in respect of whom there is no real prospect of their removal from Australia becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  In the final moments, I just want to take the minister back to the answer that he gave Senator Hanson, because it's worth digging into what the minister said in response to her questions about the need to release the detainees. On 8 November, the High Court issued a writ of habeas corpus in NZYQ, and we've never disputed that you needed to comply with that order. That's clear. Of course you did. And, of course, the principles laid down by the High Court in the NZYQ case will apply more broadly. That is the nature of High Court reasons. The High Court will not grant special leave to appeal unless the case is significant across the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the thing that the government is trying to hide is that it is dependent on a government assessment. I would put to you that the misleading part of the comment that you gave to Senator Hanson is this: the decision to release, in each case, is a government decision. Let's just assume for a minute—and I can't say that this is the case—that each of the 147 detainees was required to be released. If that were true, it should have involved 147 decisions, each of which involved the careful application of the principles laid down by the High Court over 74 paragraphs. It should have involved the facts, the history of the matter and the prospects of removal, in light of the principles articulated by the seven justices of the court. But the only thing we can say for sure is that in the vast majority of cases that didn't happen. We know that, because at the time the government released the vast majority of detainees it did not have the court's reasons. The Attorney-General can make all the statements that he wants and then table them in the Senate, saying, 'Oh dear, the High Court made me do it,' because that is literally what we have been hearing from the government day after day, excuse after excuse after excuse—the Attorney-General: 'It isn't my fault;' the Prime Minister: 'It isn't my fault.' Meanwhile, the Australian people will be living with paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer who have no right to remain in Australia. That is a fact. And they were released because the Albanese Labor government—the Prime Minister himself, Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil—bungled the case in the High Court and then panicked and botched the response. The record should be crystal clear that this is a debacle of your own making. The question before we finish is: what is the status of the 340 additional individuals who were referenced in the High Court hearing?</span>

It's an extraordinary proposition that Senator Cash has been advancing over the last few days. I can understand it, given that Senator Cash served in a government that delivered us robodebt, an illegal system. We know that Senator Cash has a history of not personally cooperating with law enforcement when it comes to police investigations. A deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said as much in estimates a few years ago.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Senator Cash seems to be arguing that we should keep doing. Mr Dreyfus went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs undertakes expert assessment of whether a person is an "NZYQ-affected person". If and when it is clear that a person in immigration detention is an NZYQ-affected person, the Department must immediately take steps to secure the person's release from detention. There is no legal basis on which the Government can delay releasing the person until, for example, a court orders the person's release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, whether a person is required to be released turns solely on whether they fall within the limit identified by the High Court's order in NZYQ—and not, for example, on their personal circumstances including any criminal history they may have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a fundamental principle of our system of law that the government cannot deprive a person of their liberty without positive authority conferred by law. Following the High Court's decision in NZYQ, there is no power to detain the affected non-citizens under the Migration Act. There is no power for a minister to direct an officer to detain the affected non-citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, any delay in releasing an NZYQ-affected person could expose the Commonwealth and individual officers to liability for (among other things) false imprisonment. Any officer who continues to detain a person who they know is an NZYQ-affected person may also be acting in breach of the APS Code of Conduct and be liable to disciplinary action as a result.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So every time Senator Cash and her colleagues continue mounting this argument that the government was not required to release the people that we have released, what she and the coalition are effectively saying is that the Australian government should continue detaining people that we have no legal right to detain.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The High Court has made the law clear and governments, I would have thought, should follow the direction of the High Court. I think it is slightly concerning that the opposition are suggesting that the kind of government they would operate would be one that would ignore the High Court and would detain individuals without any legal power to do so. That is a very worrying suggestion, and I would urge Senator Cash to reconsider that position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on my feet, I might just point out that Senator Cash, Mr Dutton and their colleagues have made a lot of hay over the last few weeks about the individuals we are talking about. You would think that their record in government around immigration detention has been without blemish and that they never exposed the Australian public to any risk. Well might I remind the opposition that their record was somewhat different to how they might like to remember it. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New Daily</span> in April 2018 reported:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Detainees at immigration detention centres on Australian shores have successfully escaped more than 80 times since July 2013, government figures reveal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the total number of detainees who escaped detention during the period would be higher because some reported incidents have involved more than one person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So even in 2018, five years into the coalition government, there had been more than 80 escapes from immigration detention centres. So for people who want to come in here and be holier than thou about saying that their record was blemish free and they never exposed the Australian public to any risk, well, the facts don't actually back that up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January 2018 it was reported that two men escaped from Melbourne immigration transit accommodation detention facility in Broadmeadows, north of Melbourne, on New Year's Eve. In 2014, in the early period of the coalition government, when Mr Morrison was still the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, it was reported that 'an underworld figure capable of extreme violence was on the run after escaping from the Victorian detention centre he was being held in as he awaited deportation from the country. The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison, confirmed the breakout.' He confirmed that two adult male detainees absconded from the Maribyrnong detention centre earlier today with outside assistance. So let's not pretend that the detention regime that was overseen by Dutton, Mr Morrison, Senator Cash, all of the coalition, was some perfect system that never exposed Australians to risk. Those are just three examples where we saw escapes—in some cases, we saw mass escapes—from immigration detention under the LNP. I think we should all recognise the kind of wild claims that have being made over the last few weeks by the coalition as base politics, because we know the thing they are best at is playing politics, dividing the Australian community, injecting fear into the Australian community rather than working constructively to keep the Australian community safe. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  Minister, constituents lack confidence in Labor when it comes to security, especially after the last few weeks. So I'm wondering whether or not you will be supporting my amendment to do a simple review of the legislation, especially the amendments. If not, what is the problem? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the Senate that last week's highly significant Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Bill 2023 saw 31 amendments from the government to its own legislation in the House of Reps plus 20 amendments in the Senate. There was a total of 51 government amendments to its own bill, and those from the crossbenches and the Liberals brought them to 69. Minister Burke has been falsely creating the dishonest label 'closing loopholes' to hide the Hunter mining and energy union's complicity in aiding some labour hire firms in Australia's largest-ever wage theft worth billions of dollars. We're told that the Greens oppose the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. They said so themselves just last week. Yet the Greens now support it because Labor has apparently agreed to allow the Greens to move amendments to the EPBC Act. The Greens support Labor's disastrous Nature Repair Bill apparently in return for Labor's support for disastrous Greens amendments to an existing law not before the Senate.</span>

No, we won't be supporting the amendment putting forward a review. As I made it clear earlier in this debate, we are modelling this regime on the existing high-risk terrorist offenders regime. So we have some confidence in its ability to work, given it's been based on a regime that already exists. In addition—I don't know if you were here, Senator Roberts, when I mentioned this before—one of the amendments that we've tabled, clause 395.49, requires the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs to deliver an annual report about the operation of this regime. That is intended to give a level of transparency going forward to how this regime is operating, and we think it is an adequate measure to ensure that there is transparency in the system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Absolutely. Let's just be clear that, despite the rhetoric coming out again from the minister's mouth, we have never disputed that the government needed to comply with the order of the High Court. That is a fact. We have never disputed that. Of course, you did. The issue we have is in relation to the other 147 detainees who have now been released. The government has refused to answer whether or not that involved 147 separate decisions and whether or not each of those cases involved the careful application of principles laid down by the court over 74 paragraphs. They have refused to tell us whether or not the assessments involved the facts, the history of the matter and the prospects of removal in light of the principles articulated by the seven justices of the court. One can only assume, therefore, that in the majority of cases this did not happen. We know that. Why do we know that? Because you did not have the principles articulated by the seven justices of the High Court when you released the vast majority of the detainees. The Albanese government did not have the court's reasons. So what we would like to see you do, as I've said, in relation to each of the 147 hardcore criminals—rapists, pedophiles, murderers and a contract killer—that you have released into the community, is provide the Australian people with a complete analysis of the assessment that was undertaken. I won't hold my breath.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, for the avoidance of doubt, since the government has circulated amendments to the EPBC Act and since the EPBC Act is not otherwise amended by the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill, the government is taking this step to enable the amendments to the Nature Repair Market Bill to be moved. It's a necessary procedural step. It enables the Senate to deliver important and commonsense environmental reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important reform. Our government is seeking to establish the world's first national nature repair market, and this market will make it easier for businesses, philanthropists and others to invest in projects that restore and repair nature across Australia without greenwashing. Investment in the nature repair market means landholders, including farmers and First Nations groups, will get paid to improve the environment on their properties. For example, this may involve repairing damaged riverbeds, replanting critical habitat of threatened species or removing invasive species, such as feral cats and weeds. Tonight our government is also seeking to update the water trigger so that all new unconventional gas projects will be assessed for their impact on water resources. Before the election, Labor promised to do this, and we are delivering. We set this out in the Nature Positive Plan, which was released at the end of last year, after consulting with APPEA and the gas industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are reforms which have been proposed by at least three reports: the Northern Territory government's Pepper scientific inquiry, the 2018 Senate inquiry into water use by the extractive industries and the 2021 interim report of the Senate inquiry into oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo basin. All of these inquiries recommended that the EPBC water trigger be expanded to cover all forms of unconventional gas. It's a commonsense change, colleagues, providing business with certainty and the community with confidence that water resources and our environment are properly regulated and protected. The update will expand the water trigger which already applies to coal seam gas to include other types of unconventional gas developments, such as shale gas. Most new gas projects will be unaffected by the change, as coal seam gas production is already covered by the existing water trigger and the changes do not apply to conventional gas production. Existing gas projects that are in production and have already been approved are unaffected by this update. Projects regulated by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, will also be unaffected by this update. This will provide certainty for business and ensure continuity of gas supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are grateful for the support of members of the crossbench to pursue these two important government initiatives together. We have agreed to support a number of amendments proposed by the Greens—namely, amendments to prevent biodiversity certificates from being used as environmental offsets and to remove references to offsets from the bill, and an amendment to change the name of the bill. The government has had many conversations with the crossbench about delivering our commitments, and that includes our nature repair market and expanding the water trigger. We are working with all members of the crossbench on this legislation. This is an important reform, colleagues. These are important initiatives, and I commend them to the chamber.</span>

Just yesterday, we had this motion that Senator McAllister has referred to. It had no detail, was nebulous in its construct and talked about provisions of the EPBC Act to be referred to in assessing and approving certain petroleum mining developments. 'Certain'—we didn't know what they were. Only at 5.52 this evening—less than an hour ago—have we seen the amendments relating to these particular issues. It is really starting to become a pattern of behaviour in this place that the government seems to think that scrutiny is not important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might remind the Senate that, of course, just yesterday we voted on a motion to end a further four months of scrutiny on the Nature Market Repair Bill and the associated bill—legislation which, up until yesterday, no-one other than the government supported. In relation to the Australian Greens, I read Senator Hanson-Young's comments in the committee hearings saying that the bill was in tatters, that it had no friends and that it was going to leave the environment worse off. Now here we are with an arrangement between the Australian Labor Party and the Greens political party rushing to have this bill voted on and passed before parliament rises. So urgent this is that we must get it done before the parliament rises! As a sign of disrespect to this chamber, the people we represent and the industries that keep our economy ticking over, we're going to rush these amendments in with no or little information or clarity around what they're actually about. I'm glad we have at least an hour and a half of committee stage to interrogate this flurry of amendments, including the amendments from the government that have been talked about here by Senator McAllister. She gave some clarity around what has been tabled just less than an hour ago, at 5.52 pm, this document here, which outlines what the government's new plan is—the one that wasn't contemplated in the committee inquiry, wasn't referred to in the government senators report and wasn't referred to in the Greens' dissenting report, a 'dissenting' report in a bill that they're now going to support. What an interesting change of events there!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to know exactly—and I'll be able to ask these questions—what consultation was had with industry about these amendments tabled less than an hour ago. I'm going to hazard a guess: none. I'd love to know which participants in the industry are caught up in this set of amendments. I don't think they know. I don't think they've actually gone out to figure it out. It's just about getting a deal before the end of the year because the government needs a win. It has been a terrible couple of weeks, and, in fact, it has been a terrible 18 months, if you really think about it—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeking to suspend standing orders to be able to bring on these extraneous amendments relating to another act, which were referred to in a nebulous fashion yesterday, and we don't know what the extent of the consequences is going to be. But do you know what? I suspect the government have got the numbers. They've done a deal. We still don't know what price has been paid for these amendments to be supported by the government—this expanded water trigger that is going to have massive impacts—or whether any modelling has been done on the costs to people who may wish to get a project up, to create jobs, to provide energy to the market. We don't know. Has there been a regulatory impact statement, which is something good governments normally do? I'd be interested to know, to foreshadow that question. I'm sure Senator McDonald has similar questions as well. Again, I'll take a punt on that: I don't reckon any of this has been done, because it is the last week of the year, ladies and gentlemen, and it's all about getting a deal. It's all about getting a win. It's all about looking like we're in control and we know what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are the impacts of these amendments unknown and we've barely had an hour to read through the documents that have been dropped on our desks but, in fact, we don't know about a range of amendments that the minister has already said the government have agreed to and what impact they will have. We will consider our position on all of them, but, at the end of the day, I'd just say that this year ends as it has been all the way throughout—that is, shambolic. This is a government that lurches from one problem to the next and does dodgy deals to try and look like it's in control. This is not the bill they had on the table all the way through the committee process. They have cut off scrutiny because they are embarrassed about where they're going. It's all about getting a win. They don't care about the Australian people, and these amendments just prove that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  The Greens will be supporting this contingency motion. The reason is that, if we are going to be voting and passing environmental legislation in this place, it should be environmental legislation that actually does something. Under the amendments that have been circulated by the Greens and the new set of amendments that has been circulated by the government to incorporate a water trigger into our nation's environmental laws, finally, this bill actually does something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will take Senator Duniam's point from his contribution just now that, when this bill was first tabled, it was a dog's breakfast. It didn't protect the environment, and all it did was provide offsets for corporations to destroy one piece of environment over here while pretending to protect something else over there. 'Destroy a koala habitat here, and, hopefully, look after some Tassie devil habitat there—I am offsetting the environment against itself.' That is what a dog of a bill this was. With the amendments that have been tabled and circulated today, this bill will now be a bill that protects the environment and puts in place environmental assessments particularly in relation to fracking projects. It is absolutely bonkers that in 2023 we have environmental laws in this country that do not require any type of environmental assessment for big gas corporations to frack. Zilch. Zero. It's time that was fixed. That is why this amendment is important. That is why this contingency motion is essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spend a lot of time talking to traditional owners in the Northern Territory. I spend a lot of time talking to farmers in the Northern Territory. They tell me, over and over again, that they want proper process. They want due process for these projects. They want to know that there will be a proper assessment, that someone is looking at what is being proposed, that someone is looking at the facts, that someone is thinking about the consequences and that there is some national oversight of this. That is what this motion before us now will allow to happen. It will amend our environment laws to give a proper overview before any big fracking projects are just ticked off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will speak further in the committee stage in relation to the Greens amendments to remove and scrap all of the offsets in this Nature Repair Market Bill. I will also speak to amendments that change the name of the bill. That's because no longer is this the Nature Repair Market Bill this government brought forward; it is essentially a new bill that, if it gets through this place, passed by the Senate, will establish proper protection for the environment, establish proper protection for our precious water resources and ensure that big corporations can't continue to greenwash. That is what this amended bill will deliver if we can get it done. I urge every member of this place to take the opportunity to do it. We are about to leave parliament at the end of the week. Wouldn't it be good to give the environment a Christmas present it deserves?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  Scrutiny or, rather, the avoidance of scrutiny is what drives the Greens and Labor coalition in the Senate. The Greens stated recently, just days ago, that they were strongly opposed to this bill, this 'nature repair' bill. What about the arrogance? The Greens now support it because Labor has agreed to allow the Greens to move amendments to the EPBC Act. The Greens will support Labor's disastrous Nature Repair Market Bill in return for Labor's support for the Greens' disastrous amendments to an existing law not before the Senate. This is preposterous. It's very dodgy. It's unheard of. And why? Because their arrogance says that the Labor-Greens-Teal coalition in the Senate can get away with it. They are saying to the people of Australia: 'To hell with you lot. We will give you the middle finger.' That's why they're doing it. They are hiding their political mates and bosses from scrutiny. They're not doing it properly.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson-Young talked about saving koala habitats. Their wind turbines and solar panels are killing koala habitats and they are actually talking about bludgeoning koalas. 'That's the way to do it,' they say. They want to avoid scrutiny and are killing the environment to save it!</span>

                  </a>  Notice that they can't handle an argument. They start getting into invective. Speaking of scrutiny, last week's water amendment bill revealed under scrutiny, because it was allowed just briefly, 31 amendments from the government in the House of Representatives, plus 20 amendments in the Senate, on its own bill. That's 51 government amendments in total to its own bill. This is typical of what we have seen for 18 months. Then, if you add the amendments of the crossbenchers and the Liberals, you get 69 amendments to a water amendment bill. Consultation? Ha!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was the identity verification scheme rushed in here. Again, they are hiding from scrutiny. That's the theme of the Labor government and its Green and Teal coalition partners—protecting themselves from scrutiny. The Greens used to be in favour of orders for the production of documents, but not anymore. They protect Labor quite often. Then we see Minister Burke protecting their mates from scrutiny and falsely creating the dishonest label 'closing loopholes' to hide the Hunter region Mining and Energy Union's complicity in aiding some labour hire firms in Australia's largest ever wage theft, worth billions of dollars. They're doing nothing about the fact that the Fair Work Commission protects blatant breaches of law in approving the Mining and Energy Union's enterprise agreements, enabling systemic wage theft, hiding their mates from scrutiny and protecting the Fair Work Ombudsman for using a fraudulent document that covers up the Mining and Energy Union's enterprise agreements, enabling systemic wage theft. They're hiding their mates and donors, their agenda and their coalition partners. One Nation will be opposing this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  What an absolute farce this is. I rise to speak against the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and whatever dodgy deal has been done where Labor has capitulated to the Greens political party yet again. We are seeing the standard of Labor's parliamentary process, where they promise the world, then rush a backroom deal and try to ram through legislation without consultation. What was the promise to the Greens political party from this Labor government, a government that obviously struggles to keep its word?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 15 May 2023, the Minister for the Environment and Water, Ms Plibersek, told RN Breakfast:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm proposing to release those exposure drafts in the second half of this year so people will be able to comment on the proposed changes that we're making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the environment minister. What a joke that is, because here we are with absolutely no consultation—in fact, the ink is not dry on the amendments that we're looking at now. Where were these exposure drafts? Where can people comment on these changes? Well, they miss out on that, thanks to yet another dodgy deal through the back room. I remember the days when the Greens believed in transparency and good government. What a happy memory that is. Has anyone had the chance to review this legislation? Or has Labor only bothered to consult the people who are the most out of touch with Australians—the Australian Greens political party?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This pattern should not be a revelation, though, to the Australian public as it's become apparent that the Albanese Labor government are desperate to protect their own political careers by trying to buy Greens votes in Melbourne and Sydney. Surely it is only a coincidence that there was a swing to the Greens at the last election in Minister Plibersek's electorate. What about the rest of her Labor colleagues? Have any Labor members from Western Australia or the Northern Territory faced up to their constituents and had to tell them that Minister Plibersek is trying to save her own political career by pandering to Greens votes in inner-city Sydney or that Labor are abandoning the gas and manufacturing industries to save their own necks? What about Labor Premier Roger Cook, who recently had to come out and try and defend the gas industry, saying, 'No-one will thank us if we don't have enough gas.' Is Premier Cook aware of the dirty, dodgy backroom deals being done between his federal colleagues and the Greens political party that put his state budget in the firing line? Any claim from the Labor government that they support the gas industry is undermined by their continual capitulation to the Greens political party. We have had the safeguards amendment, funding of the EDO and the anti-gas Middle Arm inquiry, not to mention housing deals and the Murray-Darling Basin. And now we have this rushed backroom deal to target gas supply. This Greens political party is pulling the strings of the Labor Party, as if they were already in government together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, even without this dodgy, rushed deal, this legislation is another example of Labor putting their inner-city Greens fantasies ahead of the realities of life for hardworking Australians, especially land managers like farmers and graziers. Labor has consistently attacked and undermined farmers, removing property rights, legislating away farmers' water rights, removing markets, stalling necessary road infrastructure and removing the ability to fish. Now this government sponsored carbon frenzy means projects are being waved through by local councils with just the bare minimum of regulatory scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absolute travesty, to have these amendments come into this place with no consultation—no consultation with industry, no consultation with members and elected representatives of those communities, and even no consultation with environment groups. I have flicked through the amendments, because I only recently got them, and there are questions that we will drive a truck through tonight. This is not the way we make legislation—with these kinds of rushed, poorly drafted amendments to get a deal done so that the Greens will support the Nature Market Repair Bill, which they've already said they didn't agree with; they said it was a dog of legislation. Are Australians going to live with the dog and the fleas that sit on its back, thanks to these terrible amendments to the EPBC Act?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  Perhaps I can decode the LNP's concerns about lack of consultation. I think what the senator is saying is they haven't had a chance to talk to their fossil fuel donors about this yet! They haven't been on the phone to Santos, Woodside, Tamboran or maybe Origin Energy! It surprises me, Senator McDonald—through you, Deputy President—that you haven't talked to the other stakeholders you claim to represent, who are farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at this. There are two consequential things we're doing here. The first thing is we're passing a strongly amended version of the Nature Market Repair Bill, which was a Liberal Party policy. This was brought to me by Mr Littleproud's office when I had the agriculture portfolio in the last parliament. This was put up to help farmers. I might remind the senator that Farmers for Climate Action—who have over 10½ thousand members now and are a big part of the NFF—recently surveyed their members, and over 5,000 members, two-thirds of them, supported an amendment version of the Nature Market Repair Bill passing the parliament. What they didn't support was using biodiversity credits to offset developers and environmental destruction. And they had some other sensible suggestions for amendments. So you claim to support farmers, Senator McDonald, but here you are trying to run interference on a bill that's actually going to help farmers if we get it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing I want to point out—and I respect, Senator McDonald, that you come from a big grazier's dynasty up in Queensland—is this: what about the farmers and graziers in the Northern Territory or the Beetaloo basin, who have consistently raised concerns about the impact fracking is going to have on aquifers and water resources in the Northern Territory? Where are they being represented in this parliament? They're being represented here tonight by the Greens and the government, who are at least passing sensible checks and balances so that these things can be assessed. If you claim to represent farmers, at least get your facts straight—or don't try and sell only one part of the story to suit your political spin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a few words in addition to that; I know we've got our Senate end-of-year party on soon, and I didn't get a chance to do a second reading speech! Like Senator Hanson-Young, I really hate the name of this legislation—the Nature Repair Market Bill. Markets can't repair nature. Governments can, and people can help—farmers want to help—but markets are probably responsible for all the problems we've got in nature and are the reason it needs repair in the first place. Any economic student will tell you the government's role is to solve externalities caused by business activities and markets. But, sadly, when you're in the pocket of fossil fuel donors, that's not going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McDonald is saying there has been no consultation on this bill. This bill has gone to inquiries and there has been significant consultation. The Australia Institute told us that the use of markets to solve biodiversity problems is about six per cent of the estimation of what actually needs to be put in to solve the extinction crisis we have before us—things such as protecting land and water, more national parks, more marine parks, new environment laws that actually do their job and fully-funded threatened species recovery plans. There is so much we need to do if we are going to help nature and help restore nature.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to put on record here that I do not support the idea of markets repairing nature. Nevertheless, as Senator Hanson-Young has so eloquently pointed out, voluntary markets already exist. You can already get credits in biodiversity markets. You can already make donations to programs—some of them are very good. But this will actually help put some regulation around that, and I look forward to seeing the detail when it comes before the Senate.</span>

Due to the routine of business today, I didn't, like others, have the opportunity to make a summing-up speech in the usual way. I want to take the opportunity now to place certain matters before the Senate and acknowledge the debate that has occurred so far, and I thank senators for their contributions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill supports the operation of the nature repair market being established under the Nature Repair Market Bill. The bill will make it easier for businesses and philanthropic organisations to invest in reversing environmental decline and repairing and restoring nature. This bill will amend the Clean Energy Regulator Act to enable the Clean Energy Regulator to effectively regulate the nature repair market. This includes allowing for members of the regulator to have relevant experience in the market. This bill will also amend the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act to allow the nature repair market to utilise the expertise of qualified and experienced auditors, ensuring integrity in the delivery of biodiversity projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Plibersek has worked closely with Minister Bowen, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, and they are committed to a nature repair market with integrity and transparency. This includes ensuring that the Clean Energy Regulator is resourced in operating to deliver its regulatory functions efficiently and effectively. The Clean Energy Regulator will be able to delegate its powers to staff within the environment department. This will ensure that the regular has access to the best expertise available for its regulatory powers and functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, I circulated government amendments to the bill. These amendments will amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to expand the water trigger to cover unconventional gas developments. Before the election Labor promised to do this, and we are delivering. This is a commonsense change. It provides business with certainty, and it provides the community with confidence that water resources and our environment are properly regulated and protected. The update will expand the water trigger to include other types of unconventional gas projects, such as shale gas projects, which are emerging as a potential new use of fracking in Australia. Most new gas projects will be unaffected by the change as coal seam gas production is already covered by the existing water trigger, and the trigger does not apply to conventional gas production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transitional arrangements will provide certainty for business and ensure continuity of gas supply. Existing gas projects that are in commercial operation and already have a Commonwealth, state or territory approval are unaffected by the new laws. For clarity, a project is not in commercial operation merely because it is in the planning, exploration or appraisal phase, irrespective of any sale of gas from this precommercial activity. Projects regulated by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, will also be unaffected by this update. The water trigger will also not apply to projects that have already been through the EPBC Act approval process. The water trigger will apply to all unconventional gas production that has a significant impact on water resources. This includes all activities associated with the different phases of the production process, including exploration, appraisal, extraction, recovery or intentional release of gas, whether by drilling, hydraulic fracturing or other means.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expansion of the water trigger has been an important issue for Northern Territory parliamentarians, particularly the member for Lingiari, Marion Scrymgour, and Senator McCarthy, and I acknowledge their work and advocacy. This issue, more broadly, is important for many First Nations communities. I acknowledge that their concerns are broader than proper environmental regulation of water. Water has important cultural value, and First Nations communities are rightly concerned to protect this value as well. We will keep working with First Nations on this as we implement these laws.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications held an inquiry into the bill, which included public hearings and the receipt of written submissions. The committee's report was released on 4 December. The committee made one recommendation, which is that both the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023 be passed, and the government accepts this recommendation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by indicating that we are delighted to have received support from many members of the crossbench for an update to the water trigger. We are grateful for their willingness to support the government pursuing this alongside this other important government initiative, the nature repair market. We have agreed to support a number of amendments proposed by the Greens—principally, amendments to prevent biodiversity certificates being used as environmental offsets and to remove references to offsets from the bill and an amendment to change the name of the bill. We, of course, appreciate the conversations we have with the crossbench every day on delivering our commitments, and that includes the conversations we've had about the nature repair market and expanding the water trigger. I thank senators again for their contributions. I commend the bills to the Senate.</span>

We have the backdrop of the cost-of-living crisis that this country is engulfed in at the moment. The people who frequent the public gallery to observe debate here are probably disappointed.

The minister and her office have spoken with a range of affected and interested businesses and other organisations, as you'd expect with this kind of legislative reform. You ask about impacts on gas prices. This change will not impact existing gas projects whatsoever. What the changes do is keep pace with changing technology. Shale gas fracking was not on the cards when the water trigger was introduced in 2013. If it had been, it would logically have been included in the definition. The changes simply ensure that there is a level playing field for all unconventional gas projects that have the potential to have significant impacts on water. This was a change that we committed to at the election. Industry have had plenty of time to prepare for this change, and importantly, these changes will give the community confidence that the impacts of unconventional gas production and water resources will be properly regulated by the Commonwealth.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  Australians are sick of the greenwashing and the greed of big corporations wrecking our environment and fuelling climate change. That is why today the Greens have secured major reforms in this piece of legislation, to protect our waterways from fracking and our wildlife from big developers intent on destroying habitat. The Greens have secured an agreement from the government to drop dodgy offsets from their nature repair scheme. We have ensured the passage of an expanded water trigger in our environment laws before the end of the year, which we know is crucial, to force fracking projects to undergo environmental assessment for their impact on water, which is owned by all Australians. These significant environmental reforms will go a long way to protecting nature and climate from greenwashed destruction and dangerous fracking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of offsets in a scheme to protect nature was a red flag to begin with and was a key concern raised by the Greens, the environment sector and many others around the country. Allowing corporations to pay to destroy nature is not nature positive. An offset scheme would not save our wildlife but would greenwash the expansion of habitat destruction for fossil fuels, logging and big development, which harm our environment. Scrapping these controversial offsets is key to ensuring that this scheme will not allow greenwashing and will not supercharge the destruction of nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' amendment, agreed to by the government, will explicitly ensure that no biodiversity credits generated under the scheme can be used for offsetting. This will ensure that this nature repair scheme is truly a voluntary biodiversity accreditation scheme. This can facilitate private investment in nature to work alongside the much-needed government investment in biodiversity to help protect and restore nature. That is going to be a job still to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme can help unlock private land to facilitate biodiversity restoration and allow groups like farmers or First Nations communities to undertake projects to restore wildlife biodiversity and habitat in their area. First Nations communities must be at the forefront of nature protection and restoration. It is critical that this scheme prioritise engagement with First Nations communities to cooperate on potential projects. Indigenous led land management is the most effective and efficient means by which to improve biodiversity outcomes, and this amended scheme can help facilitate that. Protection and restoration projects that work to ensure additional biodiversity outcomes are critical to targets like achieving zero extinctions and protecting 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030. By excluding offsets—banning offsets, dumping offsets—and stopping these projects from being used to justify disruption elsewhere, this scheme really could help work towards those targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme does not and cannot replace government investment and leadership in biodiversity protection and restoration. Critically, the Greens have also received a commitment from the government to regularly publish investment strategies to guide this biodiversity accreditation scheme and any priority projects. By scrapping dodgy offsets, the Greens have successfully stopped this scheme from becoming greenwashing destruction. Instead, it will now facilitate private investment in real, accredited biodiversity restoration that is good for the environment. Dumping offsets was always an important part of winning Greens support for this legislation. We fought hard for it and tonight we will deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this agreement, the Greens have also secured agreement that an expanded water trigger will pass into law by the end of this year. This will close the loophole which currently gives gas fracking corporations a licence to drill without there being any federal environmental water assessment. Currently, the Minister for the Environment and Water is required to assess only proposed coal seam gas projects for their water impact. Hydraulic fracturing projects remain exempt from this requirement despite their significant impact on water. Clearly, this is wrong and out-of-date and needs fixing. Today, after months of campaigning and negotiating, the Greens will ensure this is fixed. This water trigger will cover all phases of unconventional gas development, including exploration, appraisal and production. It will provide critical protection for Australia's rivers, aquifers and wetlands and the communities that rely on them. It will ensure that climate bombs like the Beetaloo basin must be assessed; that they can't just go ahead without any national oversight. It will throw a lifeline to water resources like the mighty Roper River in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fracking uses enormous volumes of water and puts ground and surface water at risk of contamination. This extended water trigger will ensure the minister is required to undertake rigorous assessment of these projects and their impacts on critical water resources. The Greens, alongside many environmental and First Nations groups, have worked tirelessly to ensure this trigger is extended to cover destructive fracking projects. I want to thank in particular the delegation of traditional owners from the Northern Territory who visited parliament earlier this year to tell us about the impacts of fracking on their country. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know this planned gas fracking will make climate change worse. We know if this fracking goes ahead we may not be able to live on country like we have for thousands and thousands of years. We need your help to keep our culture, our water, our climate and our children's futures safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our water, our land and our climate are all linked. These new environmental protections are critical in recognising this and protecting water resources into the future from the impacts of dangerous fracking. This is a hit on gas fracking corporations in places like the Beetaloo and the Kimberley. Closing the fracking loophole via the water trigger will mean gas companies will no longer be able to bypass Australia's environment laws, and fossil fuel companies will not be let off the hook for wrecking waterways and our climate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After months of pressure and negotiation, the Albanese government has listened to the Greens' calls to deliver significant environmental reforms to protect nature and the climate from greenwashed habitat destruction and dangerous fracking—gas fracking. Scrapping the dodgy offsets that would facilitate the destruction of nature is critical to ensuring biodiversity investment that is additional and has integrity. Ensuring that damaging projects undergo environmental assessment is also critical for protecting biodiversity and our climate and communities. I want to thank the crossbenchers who will support these amendments that will be moved by the Greens and those we have negotiated with the government. I also want to thank Senator McCarthy in this place, who I know is very passionate about the water trigger in particular. I also want to thank Dr Sophie Scamps in the other place, who has fought hard to have this water trigger put in place as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many, many Australians have long argued for an expanded water trigger—and tonight this is what they will get—to protect our environment and our waterways and to stop gas companies rigging the system, bypassing environment laws and thinking they can have whatever they want. Under these new laws, that will no longer be allowed.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I'm pleased that at least we can now be honest—because there you have it. That contribution by the Greens' environment spokesperson actually laid out clearly exactly what has been going on here. It was a contribution given with a high degree of certainty which, to my mind, didn't exist until very recently. It sounds to me, as described by Senator Hanson-Young, that this has been in the making for quite some time. I commend the Greens for being the green tail that wags the Labor dog—again—and for being able to achieve these outcomes which, frankly, I feel are going to have a disastrous impact on the Australian economy and the cost of living. For all the things that have been said, this is not going to end well for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last answer that was given to me by the minister, it was put to me that a range of entities, individuals and organisations were consulted—no names. I'd appreciated it if there were names provided. I'd also be interested to know whether a regulatory impact statement was undertaken by the government in preparing these last-minute amendments. I'd also be interested to know exactly when these amendments were finalised—the date and time they were finalised—because, as I've already put on the record number of times in this debate, we received these amendments at 5.52, with the supplementary explanatory memorandum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are big changes afoot. They're going to have a significant impact. I think we're going to see a huge amount of duplication. These changes, I believe, will just pave another road for green lawfare to occur. That's great news for the environmental defenders office and bad news for gas consumers, bad news for the economy and bad news for the cost of living. But, I tell you what, that is exactly what certain people in this place proudly fight for, and good on them. That is something that they can stand up for. But I just have to reflect, in asking these questions, on the shambolic nature of where we are today. Just a day and a half away from this place rising for the summer break, from people going back to their electorates, we are rushing this legislation through as if it is going to change the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last Friday, contributions were sought from senators in relation to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. There was the majority senators report, which of course told us the bill was amazing and needed no change whatsoever and recommended that the Senate pass the bill as drafted. There was the coalition dissenting report. Our position remains the same on this piece of legislation. We still think it's terrible. We still think it's bad. We still think it's unnecessary to go down this path for all of the reasons I've already outlined—all of the uncertainty it's going to bring about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can go through the various contributions to the committee inquiry. Lyndon Schneiders is the executive director of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation. There was a big element of the debate that took place in relation to these bills during the committee process, and that was a fundamental principle that I thought everyone—or at least non-government senators—shared and stuck to. That was the need to deal with the EPBC Act first, to be able to get a framework legislation around national environmental approval laws in place, have the national environmental standards bedded down and have all of the other relevant elements put in place so we knew exactly what the landscape was going to be. That suddenly isn't a problem anymore. I will quote Lyndon Schneiders again, someone I probably won't quote too many times in this place. The executive director of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We recommend that the NRM (Nature Repair Market) Bill be delayed until Parliament has been presented with key EPBC reforms, including proposed National Environmental Standards for environmental offsets, regional planning, and threatened species protection, to demonstrate that a rigorous and high integrity regulatory system will support the operation of the Nature Repair Market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears tonight because we are wading into this area of legislative change, which is going to have significant impacts—and I do dispute what the minister said in the claim that this will have zero impact on the cost of gas because it won't affect existing projects. Sadly, supply is a key element to being able to meet demand and therefore has an impact on gas prices. So I don't buy that, and I think you will rue the day that you made those comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the concerns around that—and, in one of the hearings, Senator Hanson-Young herself made those very comments to departmental officials about this bill being in tatters and it being an absolute sham. But suddenly now it's okay to support it because of some amendments that appeared out of nowhere on the day we're debating this legislation. It just smacks of a Labor-Greens stitch-up, something we should have come to expect in this place. It's something that, sadly, is becoming a hallmark of this government in this term of parliament, where it looks like there's a proper fight on and that there's going to be some consistency and integrity shown by political parties, who go into a process saying, 'You know what? These are our red-line issues and we're not going to budge,' until they budge and they get a deal done behind closed doors, where there is no scrutiny and where there is no regulatory assessment of the impact that these new laws and regulations will have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no modelling done on what cost implications there will be for individuals or entities seeking to commence a new project. We don't know how many organisations will be caught up in this, with projects that are planned. Surely the government, who work with entities out there, have some understanding of exactly what is in the offing. I haven't got an answer to that and I suspect we won't have one because there is no modelling and there is no concern for what this might mean for the economy, for the community and for the cost of living. It is, as I said before, simply about getting a deal done so that they can claim they have a win at the end of the year in order to try and cover over what has been one of the most shambolic fortnights in parliament, where we have seen terrible things happening and the government trying to pretend there are no issues at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, against the backdrop of a government that can't get its act together when it comes to environmental policy, we were promised that the national environmental law replacement, the replacement for the EPBC Act, would be in this place before the end of this year. We have a couple of days left, and there is nothing—not a thing to be seen with regard to that promise that was made by the government. And I wonder why. Why have they done the go-slow on that? Again, it points to the need for this government and this minister, Minister Plibersek, to get a win. And today she gets a win and the Australian Greens get a win. The people of Australia are the ones who are going to pay for the deal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, I'd love to know exactly who was consulted in the preparation of these additional consequential amendments that we're discussing right now. Was a regulatory impact statement done, and when, precisely, were these amendments finalised with the Greens given, as I said before, they were tabled at 5.52 this evening?</span>

I think the senator would accept that the Nature Repair Market Bill has been the subject of consultation and discussion through the Senate inquiry, and, indeed, he referred to that in his earlier remarks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm advised that the minister has spoken with, amongst others, Santos, Beach Energy, Tamboran, Empire Energy, and Australian Energy Producers about the amendments that are proposed. But I do reiterate my earlier remarks, which are these. The government went to an election indicating our intention to introduce a water trigger that would cover unconventional gas projects. This is not a surprise. It shouldn't be a surprise to the opposition and will not be a surprise to industry either. In relation to regulatory impact statement requirements, the government has met its RIS requirements. A RIS was undertaken on the nature repair market, and the Samuel review into the EPBC Act satisfies the RIS requirement in relation to the water trigger generally.</span>

But surely the detail of these changes, these legislated black-letter law changes to the water trigger, matters. It matters how the legislation is written. So, my question to you is: when were relevant stakeholders advised that this bill would be debated this week? Were stakeholders consulted prior to the guillotine motion being passed by the government? And when did stakeholders—you named Tamboran and Empire, amongst others—see the black-letter legislation that we're now looking at?</span>

I'm just interested, in terms of timing, as to why the government hasn't brought that in the past 18 months, given that there are the numbers in the Senate to pass that swiftly. And now we've got this attached to an unrelated bill in these circumstances where I don't think we have adequate time to scrutinise the nature repair market.</span>

The amendment to create a water trigger that would cover all forms of unconventional gas is another. Further, there are the broader reforms around the EPBC Act that arose in part from the consideration of these questions undertaken by Professor Samuel under the previous government. This is a big legislative agenda. We have sought to progress it in the most efficient way possible. We know it requires consultation and discussion. We find ourselves in a position this week to progress two important parts of the government's agenda—the first being the establishment of the arrangements for the nature repair market and the second to put in place a water trigger. I think that you would support the latter. I'm uncertain about your views about the nature repair market as described in our legislation. But we look for opportunities to work with people within the parliament to progress our agenda and it's on that basis we are bringing forward the legislation this evening.</span>

Thank you for that, Minister. It's disappointing that with a government that promises things like a water trigger and has a Senate urging it to get on with that and do it we have to wait 18 months and that it's been bundled into the NRM and pushed through like this when you could have brought it forward at any time. It took a crossbench deal to get you to come good on an environment election commitment, but we see the government very keen to put other election commitments through. Minister, my question is: will the government commit to no reduction in funding for nature and invasive species management after the market is created? The market cannot be a substitute for investment in public good.</span>

We understand that there is an enormous amount of work to do in relation to restoring and protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of this arises from a very extended period of neglect. The government previously led by Mr Morrison and, before him, Mr Turnbull and, before him, Mr Abbott got report after report—including the <span style="font-style:italic;">State </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment report</span> and the review of the Water for the Environment Special Account—that showed them that nature was in serious strife, in serious trouble, and that the measures that they were supposed to be pursuing to protect assets like the Murray-Darling Basin were not on track. Instead of acting on those reports and on that information that was provided to them, they hid them. They got an independent review from Professor Samuel that showed that the environment laws were broken and they did nothing serious about that independent review to fix those laws. They refused to act on climate change, a question that we have addressed in other debates. They announced 22 different energy policies and didn't land any of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we understand that there is a lot of work to do. Establishing a framework where we can harness private sector investment to support the repair of our natural assets is one part of that, but so is government funding for nature repair and so are better laws to protect our environment when we are contemplating development and so are arrangements to create additional protected areas so that there are parts of the terrestrial environment and the marine environment that are actually protected and the animals and plants that live in them are looked after. All of these things form part of a comprehensive package to tackle issues around the environment. This is not the beginning and the end of the things that our government considers important.</span>

I've got two questions. Given we're 18 months in, firstly, I’m interested in which of Graeme Samuel's recommendations the Albanese government have implemented. And, secondly, one of the things that kept coming up in the consultation I did on the nature repair market was that everyone said that there will need to be government investment to get this started. If you look at the carbon market, the ERF—a couple of billion dollars or $1.5 billion put into kickstarting that and actually getting a pipeline of projects. Every stakeholder seemed to say: 'Yes, it could potentially work. There are some integrity issues with the Clean Energy Regulator administering something like biodiversity,' which is not exactly fungible and a lot more complex than carbon. My question is how much money is the Albanese government committing to creating that demand and creating a pipeline of projects?</span>

The bill does define administrative decisions of the Clean Energy Regulator that can be reviewed, and they include refusal to register a project or refusal to issue a biodiversity certificate. Merits review of the decision can be initiated by a person aggrieved by the decision of the regulator, and this includes the person who made the application for the decision, and a decision of a delegate of the regulator would generally be reviewed internally before it can proceed by application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you probably know, our government has initiated reforms to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the new model will apply to the nature repair market through relevant legislative amendments. The minister's decisions to make, vary or revoke a method or biodiversity assessment instrument or the advice of the independent advisory committee are not subject to merits review as they are not administrative decisions. The methods and biodiversity instrument are legislative instruments and subject to normal parliamentary process, including disallowance and sunsetting. Methods and biodiversity assessment instruments will be developed in consultation with stakeholders and must be reviewed by the independent advisory committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's advice is not subject to merits review. However, the process for creating the advice involves a rigorous statutory process with many integrity elements, including public consultation. The final advice will be published along with submissions to public consultation and a statement of reasons by the minister, and this provides transparency about the advice and how elements such as the biodiversity integrity standards have been applied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the independent statutory reviews of the bill conducted every five years will include a review of the operation of the committee and the kinds of advice provided to the committee. Decisions made under the bill may also be reviewed under relevant judicial review legislation in relation to errors of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For most matters that are the subject of merits or judicial review, the bill allows people directly affected by a decision to ask for a review or appeal the decision, and examples of people who can request a review would include a person who has been refused the issuance of a certificate and a person directly affected by the approval of a project being registered, such as a neighbour. However, the bill does not provide for open standing for such appeals, nor for injunctions to enforce compliance by proponents and others. We have not included this, because open-standing provisions could present a number of risks, including a disincentive for participation in what is a voluntary market, the potential for provisions to be used by one proponent against another with whom they are in competition and undermining the Clean Energy Regulator's approach of bringing a noncompliant proponent back into compliance.</span>

This amendment now jeopardises the development of future gas supplies in Australia for both export and domestic use. There remains considerable risk of gas shortfalls, as forecast by the ACCC and AEMO, and of course this flows on to considerable risk to the jobs of all those Australians employed on these projects. I want to understand whether or not Minister Farrell has told our international partners, like Japan and Korea, that the government is now actively targeting promising new gas suppliers in the Beetaloo with their water trigger. Or has Assistant Minister Ayres, who parades himself as a champion of the manufacturing industry, told Australian manufacturers that their gas supply may now be at risk because of yet another secret deal done with the Greens political party, who just want to shut down their gas?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn again to the amendments on sheet SF110, circulated at around 6 pm this evening. The sheet has a list of unconventional gas production definitions, which are markedly similar to the definitions introduced by the Greens in their proposed water trigger. Minister, in the amendment on sheet SF110, is it possible to vary the definition of 'unconventional gas' under section 528(d), which states 'any other sources prescribed by the regulations'?</span>

I want to clarify that this bill would not currently require but does enable regulations which would capture all offshore gas extraction, should the definition of 'unconventional' be changed. I want to understand: is the Minister for the Environment and Water the determining minister for these regulations? Does consultation with any other ministers or state jurisdictions have to occur prior to this change?</span>

Minister, what is considered 'other developments' in this context? Will it include pipelines, transport infrastructure or storage facilities? I want to understand what consultation has occurred with regard to the wideranging scope of this caveat. Given that these amendments were only circulated at 6 pm this evening, I would imagine that saying 'we will be introducing a water trigger' is a very broad topic.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, finally—this is my last block of questions—AEMO and the ACCC have warned of imminent gas supply shortfalls as early as this summer. They've recommended a range of solutions, which include the urgent need for upgraded pipeline capacity from Queensland to the southern states—suitable storage facilities. Without these upgrades and an urgent increase in gas supply, households and businesses may face blackouts and energy shortages this summer. Does the amendment to the EPBC water trigger in this bill increase or decrease the regulatory burden on gas companies? Is the government concerned that this capitulations to the Greens political party's demands to rush this amendment will impede the approval of other developments, which will risk gas supply? Finally, has the government done any consultation on the risk to future investments in gas projects in Australia that will affect future royalties, company taxes, PAYG taxes and employment of hardworking Australians?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:06</span>):  As a servant of the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, it's my duty to ensure I deal with every bill that comes before the Senate fully and properly. All too often, this government does dodgy deals with the Teals, the crossbench and the Greens to get legislation through without scrutiny. This is legislation that's written for reasons of ideology, not human need, and that as a result makes things worse. This is legislation that must get through without debate, lest the electorate be informed about what the government is really doing to them in the name of the United Nations' sustainable development goals.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm speaking about the Nature Repair Bill 2023, only 30 minutes from when the vote will be taken, yet I'm speaking to an interim bill. The massive amendments to this bill, which I know now are substantial, had not been revealed to the Senate just an hour ago. It appears to be the government's plan to provide the amendments and then require an immediate vote. That was exactly what we saw. That's not how the house of review, our Senate, works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more troubling is that the government now has a motion that would allow the Greens to amend the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as part of this bill—news to us until an hour ago. What that means is the Greens, with Teal Senator Pocock's support, are being allowed to put a bill of their own making onto the end of the government's bill and then vote it all through—a bill we can't read, can't amend and can't debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a longstanding convention in the Senate that we do one bill at a time and amend only the bill at hand, a rule the government are happy to ignore when they get desperate enough numbers to do a deal with the Greens and Teals. This isn't parliamentary process; it is undemocratic dictatorship. What a joke, and the people will be paying for it. When we call the Greens watermelons—green on the outside and red on the inside—this is why. Soviet Russia would pull a stunt like this, not democratic Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken on several occasions recently on how this Labor government is best friends with the world's predatory parasitic billionaires. This bill is a perfect example of that. Like the failed national electricity market, which is really a racket, this bill allows large corporations to greenwash their businesses. To explain, greenwashing allows a business—most likely a foreign multinational company—to make a claim such as being 'net zero friendly'. That's simply not true. They're deceiving investors and customers in the process. They get to net zero by purchasing green certificates or carbon dioxide credits to balance out the environmental costs supposedly incurred in their business operation. A European Union report found that 95 per cent of carbon dioxide credits came from projects that did not make a difference to the environment, and Europol just a few years ago said 95 per cent are crooked. In other words, it's all a con.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining industry have come out in favour of offsets, which they call 'avoided-loss offsets'. These offsets occur after purchasing and improving an area of land with the same habitat as that which is destroyed or damaged in the development. This may appear to be mining-friendly, yet it's really more expense and more green tape that would best be handled through the existing system of remediation—put it back the way you found it, or better, which is what is happening. Indeed, one could be concerned that these avoided loss offsets are an alternative to remediation. I certainly hope not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill helps wind turbines with the horrible problem of clubbing koalas on the koalas' property—clubbing them to death! They could literally club 10 koalas to death and then buy a national biodiversity certificate for 10 new koalas bred somewhere else. As we speak, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit's review is underway. The review is looking at a thousand carbon dioxide credit generating projects to see if they were fair dinkum and have been kept up. The lessons from that review were going to be added to this bill to ensure the national biodiversity certificate system was legitimate. Bringing forward this bill actually ruins that process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation opposes greenwashing, although, in most cases, we would suggest that the better option would be for our mining and manufacturing industries to first use environmentally friendly techniques, as they usually do. Then, having done that, be proud of their role in developing the economy, providing jobs and supplying materials that people need for a life of abundance. Perhaps that's just we conservatives taking care of the natural environment and taking care of people. Some submissions to the Senate inquiry called on the government to purchase the certificates themselves to provide certainty that, should a project be completed, there would be someone to buy the resulting certificate. Minister Plibersek has ruled this out—the only decision in this whole process One Nation can support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was amused with the submission from champagne socialists in the Byron Shire Council, who submitted that—quote—'free market alone may not facilitate rapid uptake of this scheme,' and called on the federal government to kickstart the market by committing to purchasing certificates itself. It will never stop. I would think that the federal government would be better off spending money on tax cuts for working Australians and paying off our debt so that interest rates come down, but that's just conservative values again—human values; real environmental values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Plibersek has described this bill as creating a 'green Wall Street'. Wall Street provides a means for financing businesses to expand productive capacity. This bill provides a means to restrict productive capacity through taking productive farmland and returning it to Gaia. I don't see the comparison with a genuine financial product, unless the minister was making a comparison to Bernie Madoff. That would be accurate in that case. The product itself, biodiversity credits, is subjective and, over time, will require more and more personnel to conduct compliance on an ever-increasing number of projects, just like the National Electricity Market—the racket. This does not increase productive capacity. It does increase bureaucracy at the public's expense, of course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many submissions opposed the use of these certificates for environmental offsets, including the Greens', and I note their amendments remove the offsets for the purpose of these certificates. This would seem a significant conflict between the minister's intent and the Greens' intent. What a mess! The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 is a solution to a problem that has not yet been defined and does not meet real needs, just like the failed National Electricity Market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working on an update on the entire Environmental Protection and Biosecurity Conservation Act—the EPBC—informed by the Samuels review into the legislation from three years ago. Those amendments will frame the problem this bill is supposedly solving. This is something that Senator Thorpe has correctly pointed out in the second reading amendment, which I will support. How do you pass a bill like this ahead of the implementation of the Samuels review? How do we know which projects should be supported and which are not needed, or, worse, which projects are a load of bollocks, like the stuff that comes out of the south end of a northbound bull, as most climate projects are—climate fraud?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to ensuring integrity around the use of offsets, the Australian government is working to introduce a new national environmental standard for actions and restoration contributions. This new standard is expected to include a requirement that offsets must deliver net gain for impacted protected matters and that biodiversity projects certified under the Nature Repair Market Bill will only be able to be used as offsets if they meet the new standard. What new standard? Oh, wait, you haven't written it yet! Great. Minister Plibersek is trying to pass a bill that implements a standard that hasn't been written yet. Can someone please give the government's legislation chocolate wheel back to rotary and we'll go back to doing things properly—you know, in the correct order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation implements something called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Positive Plan</span>. That sounds good. This is the government's overarching environmental blueprint. I notice that, on page 32, this plan includes a provision that traditional owners will have more control over Commonwealth national parks. More control! Australians who are used to bushwalking, camping and generally enjoying the beautiful national parks Australia offers are flat out of luck under this Labor government. 'No nature for you. Get back to your 15-minute cities.' That's exactly what the United Nations sustainable development goals do—they reduce everyday Australians to the status of serfs, imprisoned in their 15-minute cities, locked in a digital identity prison, owning nothing and eating bugs instead of real food. I first said that in the Senate in 2016, and the sniggers were obvious. Well, nobody's sniggering now. Now you're all trying to justify the abomination your globalist masters are working to impose.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the remainder of the Albanese government, those in this chamber will be required to face the reality of this government's globalist agenda. It's not an agenda written for the benefit of everyday Australians or for the Labor heartland. It's an agenda that serves the self-interest of the world's predatory investment funds, delivered through lobby groups like the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Economic Forum and implemented repeatedly in legislation like this. It's an agenda that will make life a misery for everyday Australians, sending them back to serfdom. One Nation stands against everything this bill represents. It proudly stands against everything this bill represents.</span>

                    </a>  No one actually—except, perhaps, Senator Canavan—thinks this is indeed funny. What we've seen here tonight is the defence of the gas industry from this side of the chamber doing the bidding of the big gas companies, the big gas cartel. They just can't help themselves, can they? They've come in here, scurried in here tonight. They've been given their marching orders to stand up for the big gas cartel and the big gas corporations. That's what they've done. And they can't handle it. They can't handle that, in this place, what we are trying to do is make sure that national environment laws are not bypassed, that there are no loopholes, that, if you want to frack in the Northern Territory or frack in the Beetaloo, you have to get an environmental approval before you go and poison people's water. That is what the amendment put forward in this bill will do today—make sure there is scrutiny of these big fracking projects and make sure that companies can't just have free reign over big areas of the Australian country and farmland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over and over and over again, I have heard from farmers in the Northern Territory that they are sick and tired of being rolled over and told to sit down and shut up by the big gas companies. Over and over again. They are worried about the quality of the water in their communities. They're worried about the impact that fracking is going to have on groundwater in their local area. They are worried that gas companies are allowed to just start fracking without any national environmental approval. It's 2023, people. We're in a climate crisis, and all we get right now is gas companies thinking they can call the shots. Well, no more. No more. Under these amendments, gas corporations are going to be held to account. There are going to be no more loopholes. Santos, I'm sure, are not happy, and I'm sure Tamboran are not happy. But, of course, over and over and over again, we see members of the National and Liberal parties come in here to do the bidding of the big gas cartel. They know who their mouthpieces are in this place, and it's this lot over there.</span>

                    </a>  You just can't—this lot just can't handle it, can they? There is not an environmental protection that doesn't upset them. There is not a piece of environmental law that doesn't rile them up. There is not a piece of environmental protection or a piece of nature that these guys don't want to bulldoze. There is not a piece of nature in this country they don't want to frack. There is not a piece of nature or wilderness in this area that they don't want to log. They want to knock it down, dig it up, burn it—that's all they're good for, over and over again: 'Look, here's our big plan: we're just going to trash everything. Let's just trash everything. Let's burn it, let's dig it up, let's knock it down, let's bulldoze it.' It doesn't really matter what wildlife is left over, it doesn't matter what the condition of the habitat is, and the state of our climate doesn't matter to them; they're a bunch of shills for the gas industry and fossil fuel companies. They can't stand environmental protection in any form. They want to be able to log, dig and burn wherever they can, and it's a time we put a stop to it. That is why the Greens are standing here today—to amend this bill to put some standard of environmental protection in our law to make gas companies have to explain themselves to their local communities, to the landholders, to the farmers and to the traditional owners in areas like the Beetaloo.</span>

Senator McDonald asked me a range of questions, and I have assembled some of the information she seeks. She asked whether the minister for the environment would be the determining minister for the regulations. The answer to that question is yes, noting that these regulations must be within the scope of the regulatory power that's provided in the act and that these regulations will be disallowable.</span>

The EPBC Act review was certified by the Office of Impact Analysis as meeting the requirements of a RIS to support actions in the government's Nature Positive Plan. The full impacts will be measured and published following the introduction of legislation where additional regulatory burdens are identified.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McDonald asked about the capacity for the seabed to be brought within the scope of offshore activity, to be brought within the scope of the water trigger. I am advised that, because the trigger is defined in relation to unconventional gas, that is not likely, as the gas which is presently extracted offshore is conventional. However, should a minister seek to do so, as with the other regulatory arrangements, any such regulation would be disallowable, and the Senate would have an opportunity to consider those matters at that time.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we understand the significance of regulatory certainty on the resource sector and we understand the significance of securing sufficient gas supply to meet our domestic requirements. The truth is that those on the other side of the chamber were warned on at least a dozen occasions when they were in government that Australia was hurtling towards a gas supply problem in the domestic east coast gas market, and their response was 22 failed energy policies that left Australian households and businesses overexposed and underprepared for a global energy crisis. We have taken a very different approach. We have reformed the ADGSM to carefully balance domestic energy needs with Australia's responsibility to meet international contractual obligations—and this is certainty; this is clarity. We've legislated a credible emissions reduction policy, through the strengthened safeguard mechanism, providing the certainty that business has been crying out for on climate policy. And the government's gas code of conduct is working to shield east coast gas consumers from volatile international gas prices and to reduce the risk of supply shortfalls forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave it there, noting that others wish to make a contribution in the remaining time. The government understands the significance of this industry. We are taking the steps necessary to provide regulatory certainty, and that's important for business and for the community.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Temporary Chair. I just want to highlight the Albanese Labor government's commitment, because it's something that's really important for us, and reflect on what I've heard from my home state of Western Australia: the importance of protection and preservation of the environment being supercritical. It's very rich for those opposite to talk about transparency when this bill is doing exactly that. I'm glad that our minister is taking bold and decisive action to protect, restore and manage our unique environment. I'll leave my remarks there, Chair.</span>

We know there's a dodgy deal. We're seeing it play out here. We've had a bit of a confession from the Australian Greens about what's been going on over the last little while, when none of us knew what was happening. We should have known, and we'll know for next time exactly where we're going to end up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two words from Senator Hanson-Young ring in my ears: 'no more'. There'll be no more new gas to bring down prices, no more support for households struggling with the cost of living, no more jobs for people in the regional communities where many of these projects exist. Certainly, there'll be no more answers to the questions that have been asked. That's not because the minister can't answer them or doesn't want to. There are no answers to these questions. Senator McAllister is, I think, one of the finest ministers in this place, and I really do look forward to seeing her elevated to the cabinet, because I think there is some room for improvement there, but there are no answers to the questions we're asking. Consultation? Regulatory impact statement? Any impact on the cost of living? No answer, no answer, no answer. This is what happens when, behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, in smoke-filled rooms—whatever analogy you want to come up with—you find Labor and the Greens doing dodgy deals. Their smiles get bigger the worse this is for Australian households and the economy. Senator McKim's smile couldn't be bigger. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Australia, watch out. It's going to be a dark, dark Christmas, with the cost of living going through the roof. They are as happy as they can be because they got their deal. It is a bad day for Australians. But this is what we have come to expect in this brave new world of Labor-Green government—</span>
