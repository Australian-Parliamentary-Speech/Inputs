I acknowledge that the limits of Australia's ability to help resolve the conflict in the former Yugoslavia are significant. Nevertheless, regarding the role Australia is playing and will be playing in the light of Saturday's tragedy in Sarajevo, will the government immediately increase its contribution to the humanitarian effort in Bosnia? Is the government discussing the situation in former Yugoslavia with allies and partners such as the United States, Canada and the countries of the European Union? Is the government now considering any shift in its support of the UN arms embargo? Does the government have any proposals to offer on how to end this tragic conflict?

         —The conflict is indeed tragic, as the honourable member for Kooyong remarks, and it is made all the more so by the outrageous and tragic attack made on civilians in the marketplace in Sarajevo last weekend, which saw the death, I think, of 60 people and the wounding of more than 200. At the moment, of course, there is no confirmation of from where the shell was actually fired or who was responsible for it. But, in a sense, that is beside the point because the conflict goes on.

         For Australia's part, the foreign minister has expressed our grief at what has happened over the weekend and on other occasions and has also provided humanitarian assistance to Bosnia—some $2.35 million—through the relevant international organisations, mainly the UNHCR and the Red Cross. We have taken 4,000 Bosnians under our special migration program.

         On the conflict itself, we have generally taken the view that Australia's influence in this area of the world is limited and that this is a matter principally for the United Nations and for the Europeans who have been involved with it. The foreign minister has kept in close touch with developments in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia, and no doubt, as a consequence of the latest atrocities, we will be seeking advice from, as the honourable member for Kooyong calls them, allies and friends—the Europeans and the United States—about their intentions and what the next prospects of a diplomatic resolution of this conflict might be.

         This is one of those conflicts where, from Australia's position, though we have an interest in it with substantial communities in Australia coming from the former Yugoslavia—perhaps a natural interest in it—our sphere of policy interest and geographical interest is, of course, limited by the fact that we are not proximate to this area and we have had few political influences with it. I can say only that the government does regard the matter as serious, and the foreign minister will be speaking to our allies about it.

         We have urged all the way through a diplomatic resolution of this issue. Any further consideration on the part of other participants in the United Nations about arming one side of the conflict against another or taking military action is a matter for a closer judgment than I think we are able to bring from this distance.

        They have contributed significantly to preserving the integrity of the multilateral trading system. In implementing its reform program, Australia realised that far-reaching, autonomous liberalisation was both economically desirable and politically feasible. Australia's pursuit of trade liberalisation in difficult times has helped to promote its own economic adjustment and has set an example for others to follow.

        I do regard it as a compliment that we have had from the GATT the words suggesting that the government's trade policies are an example for the rest of the world to follow. They are so good, in fact, that the Leader of the Opposition has now decided to adopt them. I noticed on the weekend that he said he is adopting the government's tariff policies. The Leader of the Opposition has disavowed his zero tariff policies and, while he was at it, he again disavowed the 15 per cent GST and the policy of eliminating bulk-billing in Medicare—though we still have no idea whether he is actually committed to Medicare or not. Of course, the GST going means that he cannot fund the tax cuts; presumably, he is disavowing those as well.

         I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is accusing Senator Bishop of having no policies. Of course, that is quite right, but what was very obvious on the weekend was that he has no policies either. If the notion is that, when the government puts up a proposal on tariffs, he says, `Me too'; when on Medicare we say that we are going to keep bulk-billing, he says, `Me too'; and when we say that we are not going to have a GST, he says, `Me too'—if that is the view—then let the appropriate authors of the policies be the natural government of the country, the Labor Party, and do not try to displace us by simply seeking to then put in place our policies.

         —In response to the honourable member for Lowe, let me say that some statistics have been issued today relating to retail trade and job vacancies which provide further confirmation of the strengthening of the economic recovery. In relation to retail trade, the December quarter figures show, in constant price terms, growth of 1.9 per cent, which is the strongest quarterly growth since the September quarter 1991.

         In relation to the employment area, ANZ job advertisements showed for January a further rise in the trend, making an increase over the seven months from June to January of 27 per cent, and 32 per cent over the year to January. The ANZ bank said in relation to this material that the job ads data and recent positive news from other partial indicators of economic activity—retail sales, housing, motor vehicle registrations and business surveys—support the recent upgrading in economic growth prospects for 1994 by private and government sector forecasters. So we can see from both those releases today that there is further confirmation of the strengthening of economic recovery. Those forecasters—not just the government forecasters but also private sector forecasters—have in general accepted that the recovery is strengthening and have moved to upgrade their forecasts as well.

         Economic forecasting is inherently a very hazardous business. Almost invariably one gets it wrong. It is just a matter of how wrong one is going to be. Probably of all the people who have been making economic forecasts in the last year or so no-one has got it more comprehensively wrong than the Leader of the Opposition, who has the most extraordinary record in relation to economic forecasting from the comments that he has made over that period.

         He made his first prediction of a double dip in November 1992. He thought that was not good enough and he followed that up by saying, `This country has been thrown into a prolonged recession. I think we are now in danger of drifting into a depression'. That was his view in November 1992. In January and February he started to predict on several occasions 12 per cent plus unemployment. In fact, the maximum was just over 11 per cent. He also got back into double dipping forecasts in February, and by May he was saying that the situation was getting dramatically worse, that Australia was in long-term decline, that at best economic growth appeared to be feeble and `All this talk about how the economy is growing very strongly is just dead wrong'. He also said that the IMF was likely to have to come in and rescue us.

When the budget came out he said that the budget growth forecasts were `pie in the sky stuff'—very optimistic growth numbers. These are the same numbers that we just recently upgraded from 2 3/4 per cent growth for this year to 3 1/2 per cent.

         In 1984 the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, through the termination, change and redundancy test case, brought down what has been known in the business as a TCR standard; that is, minimum redundancy standards for all federal awards. It is worth noting that it does not apply only to federal awards. It has been extended through all of the state jurisdictions. One after another, they have adopted standards along similar lines.

         Today the standard operates to protect 60 per cent of all federal award employees. Indeed, 90 per cent of all permanent employees covered by federal awards in businesses employing more than 15 people today have that protection. We are merely seeking to extend it to cover the rest of the work force. It has worked very well and there is no reason to believe that it will not operate just as successfully in the future when it is a national standard for all employees.

         Obviously, what Mr Catanzariti of Clayton Utz is doing in his four-page press release is scaremongering as he touts for business. He was waiting at home by the phone all day Sunday for a little bit of business to come in the door. His call for employers to `cull'—that was the word he used, and I am glad that the honourable member for Charlton repeated it in his question—their work force of `undesirables', his word again, before the end of March is both a vicious and a callous suggestion. In the Australian idiom, I have only heard the word `cull' in reference to kangaroo shooting. I suppose we could apply it, though, to what should happen to the opposition frontbench.

         It is disgraceful that, as the Australian economy recovers and as job prospects improve, Mr Catanzariti of Clayton Utz feels it is prudent that employers should sack such people who, he says, `are being kept on even though their presence is less than wholly desirable'. It may be that Mr Catanzariti is not acting alone. I think the House is well aware of who is the leading adviser to Clayton Utz on matters of industrial relations. It is the honourable member for Bennelong. It could well be on this occasion that Mr Catanzariti just happens to be the monkey—and we all know who the organ grinder would be in that scenario.

         The suggestion that employers should get rid of their workers just in case the law prevents them from doing so in the future is a stark reminder of the dark side of industrial relations in Australia. It is a reminder of the sort of world we would have in industrial relations if those sitting opposite had won the last election. It echoes an incident that occurred the other week concerning that other great stalwart of the New Right, Mr Peter Boyle. Honourable members will recall that he sacked six journalists employed by a suburban newspaper chain in Melbourne. The journalists were sacked because they would not sign a work contract as they preferred to retain the protection of their award—something that this government is guaranteeing they will be able to preserve in the future.

         The problem with this line of questioning is that the opposition has no clear policies in relation to sport. That was clearly demonstrated last week when the Leader of the Opposition made some comments about this program and referred to it as squandering $30 million of taxpayers' money. At the same time as he was out there talking about this money being squandered, he was being dishonest to his own constituents because at that same time the Leader of the Opposition actually sent me a letter. That letter, received in my office on 30 December, made representations on behalf of his constituent, the Bondi bowling club, for funding under this program. What an act of hypocrisy. This Leader of the Opposition is hypocritical; on the one hand he asks me 46 questions on this issue in this parliament and outside of this House he says that we have squandered the money. But when a group in his electorate asks for money, he sends the constituent's letter to me asking, `Why don't you fund them?'. He has not got the guts to write to his constituent and say what he really thinks about this program. It is hypocritical and it is gutless.

Today the Treasurer referred to the ANZ job ads survey which shows a further trend rise of 1.7 per cent, and an increase by 27 per cent since June of 1993 and 32 per cent over January 1993. This comes on top of the release last week of the skills vacancy index which shows that for January it was 50 per cent higher than a year ago and three per cent higher than in December—the highest recording since August 1990. It comes also on top of the MTIA survey of its business constituency that shows more companies in the metal and engineering industry are now creating jobs than in the last 3 1/2 years. It also comes on top of the revised forecasts for this economy in the context of the budget settings.

         It is not by chance alone that these outcomes have come about. They have come about because this government has embraced policies to make our economy more competitive, more productive and more outward looking—policies that we were able to introduce, an opportunity that those on the other side squandered for so many years while they were in office. What this, in fact, translates to in terms of the unemployment rate we will see on Thursday, but I caution the House to have regard to the participation rate and the impact that this has on unemployment figures. The fact still remains that at 10.7 per cent the unemployment rate is too high and more needs to be done to get it down.

         The other fact that cannot be forgotten is that employment growth, in terms of what we have been able to achieve by way of economic recovery, will exceed the 500,000 places which this government promised in the lead-up to the last election. Since that election promise, 125,000 jobs have already been created. As important as economic growth is for the long-term employed and for those at risk, economic growth itself will not be enough for them. Policies have to be targeted to meet their needs. This government will be doing that in the next couple of months in response to the green paper. I remind the House that on the weekend I announced increased expenditure of $47.5 million on labour market programs, particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed.

         The difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House is, firstly, that the coalition could not have delivered the policies that have led to economic growth, nor would they have been able to sustain them and, secondly, the coalition's policy prescription for the unemployed would be to leave it to economic growth alone.

        We reject the view that economic growth alone will produce the result. By leaving it to economic growth alone, we would be condemning the long-term unemployed to a life sentence of unemployment. That we are not prepared to do, and that is why our policy direction will concentrate on sustaining economic growth, but targeting policies to meet the needs of those people.

Firstly, for projects over $50,000, each of the community groups has to contribute dollar-for-dollar. Secondly, money is allocated to community groups only when the project is completed or when there is a clear indication that the project is proceeding. Therefore, it is very difficult for fraud to enter into this program. At no stage has the Auditor-General said that there was fraud in this program and at no stage will the Auditor-General find that there was fraud in this program because clearly there is no fraud in this program.

         —I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his question. In December, Australia and the United States concluded a most significant agreement on air services—one with far-reaching consequences and one that Australia should be very pleased to note. The main features of that agreement are reciprocal rights for Australian carriers on the north Pacific route; two carriers from each country in future being able to operate on the north Pacific route; a start up capacity for each carrier of three frequencies per week; all growth by carriers of either side to be the subject of set traffic performance criteria; that new rights for Australian carriers include rights to Mexico, an additional point in Asia and an additional point in the US on the north Pacific route; the dismissal by the US authorities of United Airlines legal action against the Australian government in the United States of America; and, finally, an agreement that neither side can terminate the agreement for a period of three years. It was in every sense a very significant agreement and one that Australia can be quite proud of. It is a very good outcome for us.

         It will undoubtedly benefit Australia's trade and tourism to Australia as well as our aviation industries. By providing opportunities for carriers of both countries which will now operate in the predicted high growth passenger and freight markets between north Asia and Australia over the next few years, there will be some very good outcomes from this decision. That preceded shortly the decision by North-West Airlines, which has had many well-documented financial problems, to withdraw from its three Sydney-Los Angeles services and reduce its north Pacific services.

         That decision is obviously one for North-West to take. It is a matter of judgment on its part. The Department of Transport advises me that that decision will not have any adverse impact whatsoever on the opportunity for travel on the routes concerned. The department advises me that, whilst the three services will be curtailed, there will still be around 40 flights a week between Australia and the United States—that is, 40 flights per week after the withdrawal of three flights.

         It is the government's intention to keep this matter under close scrutiny. If additional services need to be undertaken to meet the demand on that route, we will certainly do so. In the meantime, we can be very pleased with the agreement and we can be confident, I am informed, that these 40 services per week are adequate to meet the demand.

         It is not true to say that we have sacked officers at the ASO 1 and 2 level; that is, relatively junior officers. It is true to say that we have increased somewhat the number of middle level officers.

Nothing could have illustrated more her weakness as a minister, the weakness of her position in the House today, than to see the Prime Minister getting up and reading out material that she had tried to fire off herself in her own gun with her own blanks—and miss. So we get the spectacle of the Prime Minister, in an ultimate humiliation of a minister, standing at the dispatch box, trying to fill in the pieces and justify what she has been doing. The episode of the Prime Minister springing to the defence of the lame duck minister was matched only by the feelings and responses of backbenchers. They stood there in utter disbelief of the fact that, after three months, she still cannot manage any defence, any justification, in relation to the sports rorts affair.

         The sports rorts affair is no longer just a question of malappropriation, denial and cover-up. It is now a fully fledged cover-up. As was said before, it is a case of `mategate' where the minister for sports—part of the royal family engaged in a cover-up—is now like a spider pulling more and more people into this web that she has woven for herself. And today she has pulled in the Prime Minister. This minister will not only drag down herself over this affair; there is no question at all that she is now pulling down into the vortex of this absolute scandal all those who happen to be around her, all those who have attempted to cover it up, all those who cannot insist on ministerial standards, all those who cannot account to the Auditor-General, and all those who stand condemned by the actions that she engaged in as a minister in relation to this particular matter.

         This sports rorts affair started off with a malappropriation that saw this minister, who had a two-year program of $30 million, blow the lot over a three-month period, clean out the whole fund that was supposed to still be going until July 1994, in a desperate effort to shovel funds out to marginal Labor electorates prior to the March 1993 election. She managed to get rid of the $30 million by the end of January, and the Prime Minister called the election on 7 February. She managed to delve out $326,000 on average to Labor marginal seats and to ensure that coalition marginal seats got exactly half.

         She claims—this is her claim—that she personally deliberated on 2,800 applications, granted 726 of them, applied statutory formula, and did it without one single note. We might be able to replace the Medibank computers with her in future as a cost saving measure. She can sit down and take information from state, territory and local governments and prominent community leaders. She can have letters and faxes and delegations. She can decide to grant 726 applications, and she does not need a record to do it.

         The other day when she was asked to table documents, she said that there were no documents to table, but that she was going to table her brain so that we could see how this is done. It is absolutely beyond belief. She managed to reject 90 per cent of applications that her department said were well documented, demonstrated community need and satisfied all the criteria. She managed to reject 90 per cent of them whilst she was granting applications that lacked relevant information, that had no adequate demonstration of community need and that did not satisfy many of the other selection criteria. The reason for that is that this minister at no stage was personally sitting down applying all of the criteria that she talks about—disadvantaged areas, outer suburban areas, Aboriginal populations or migrant populations. She was not doing that. She sat down with her Mackerras pendulum and worked out where the seats were and who needed the money, and she made sure that she shelled out the money in a last desperate gamble to try to buy the election. That is why this has to be stopped.

         If governments get the idea that they can spend $30 million to buy elections, that is the end of open, fair and honest elections in this country. It is a great way of spending money and not having to declare it to the Australian Electoral Commission, because the donor is the Australian taxpayer. That is the way the minister has treated the Australian taxpayer—as the donor for an electoral fund. That was the first stage of the sports rorts affair—malappropriation.

         The second stage was denial. The Auditor-General went in there and said, `There is no audit trail. I cannot work out how you made the decision. Where are the records?'. He said that it was an easy money scheme that could attract flies like a carcass. And, boy, the flies were attracted to this one. We had all the Labor members who were going out announcing it and all the Labor members who were getting the grants on the eve of the election. All the flies were gathering around the carcass, gathering around an easy money scheme. But today there is one real carcass; it is a minister that is hanging dead, swinging in the breeze, waiting to go. It is this minister who cannot justify this situation to the parliament, to the Auditor-General and to the people of Australia.

         The department was concerned about this matter because it produced a minute dated 29 October 1992, noting that it was vulnerable and asking that the whole scheme be copper-bottomed. The department was going to the minister and saying, `We are in trouble here. This is a problematic scheme. Let's copper bottom the scheme'. But the minister was still in the mode of denial: `No, they will not catch me. No, we will not have to account. No, there is nothing to be answered. No, we do not have to come clean with the people and the auditor'. That was the second phase, the phase of denial.

When we go back to the previous answer, she refers to another previous answer, and that refers to another previous answer. But, at the end of the day she never gets to anything substantive, because there never has been an answer. There never is any factual foundation at all that relates to the questions that she has been asked and the concerns that were raised by the Auditor-General.

         Let us make this clear: this whole thing started off with an independent report of an auditor in relation to $30 million of taxpayers' money. Every day that has gone by has been another day when this minister has failed to give an explanation for this $30 million worth of taxpayers' money. It has been a pitiful performance. She claims it has been needs based but she cannot produce one single document to show how she applied needs or how she overrode her department. She cannot produce one document that indicates she even considered those matters. She said that she has fully cooperated with the Auditor-General, but that has just moved the whole sports rorts saga into the fourth stage: the cover-up.

         It is now clear from documents that have been produced under freedom of information that the minister was not cooperating at all. I make the point that we have the freedom of information documents from the Attorney-General's Department; we are still waiting on her disclosure. We have had a request with her department for quite some time, and we are still waiting for those documents. But these documents that were released yesterday came out of the Attorney-General's Department. They show that this minister was not cooperating at all. There is no question—it is all there in the documentary evidence. The documentary evidence says that on 10 June the head of her legal section wrote to the Attorney-General's Department asking for urgent advice on whether she had to give access to records and information to the ANAO.

         The first question is this: if there were no records, why did she need that kind of advice? Who gets advice on whether they have to release non-existent records? Who goes to a lawyer and says, `Give me some advice on whether I should turn over something that does not exist'? Why was her department writing to the Attorney-General's Department getting advice in relation to that? The minister's defence is this: `Oh, my lawyer asked the wrong question. Actually, he was only supposed to ask whether we had to answer questions, not whether we had to turn over records'. That is her defence. Her defence is: `Look, I was not trying to get legal advice to protect the records. No, I was so innocent I was only trying to get legal advice to protect myself from answering questions'. She is doubly condemned out of her own defence.

        Well, the minister's department was so right. It knew what was going on in her office; it knew it very well indeed. The minister should not come in here as she did in question time and try to say that we were somehow dishonest. We released the documents that came out of the Attorney-General's Department which say that the minister was seeking advice on whether or not to release documents, and she got the advice she had to get it.

         Even the minute the minister released damns her further, because it shows that in April her FOI coordinator had been asking the same question. So what is her defence? She says: `We had already asked a question earlier; we had already asked it once. The FOI adviser had got advice in relation to oral information'. The documentary record shows that the head of the legal section wanted the advice in writing. The minister cannot quibble with the fact that that document unequivocally shows that her lawyer requested advice in writing in relation to whether or not she had to hand across records. She should not come in with this rubbish—this absolute fantasy and farrago of fabrication—and try to divert this whole issue.

         A far more plausible explanation is this: the department got it right when it said that the matter was vulnerable and needed to be copper-bottomed; the lawyer got it right when he went off on the minister's behalf and asked for legal advice on protecting her against the release of records; the Auditor-General got it right when he said that there was no audit trail in relation to this matter; the opposition got it right when it said this was a $30 million easy money scheme to buy the minister's way back into power; and that the person who got it wrong—wrong, wrong, wrong—was the minister. The explanation is not that everybody but the minister got it wrong; the explanation is that she was the person who got it wrong. Every shred of documentary evidence that has been turned up confirms it. It confirms the fact that the minister malappropriated money and that she has tried to deny it.

All honourable members should stay and listen because a speech from the bagman of the Liberal Party will be dramatic.

Guess who could see himself slipping down the tube with the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly)? The Auditor-General was talking about flies around the carcass.

         We had the Prime Minister in this House today talking about the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)—and talking about a report that I had in one of the Australian magazines—supporting some of the programs in his electorate. One of two things has happened here: either the Prime Minister did not support the applications in his electorate and, therefore, one could say that he is letting down the people that he ostensibly represents, or, if he did put in letters of support, then he is quite an obscene hypocrite. It is one or the other. He should come in here and tell us which one it is. How about the Prime Minister's little performance in relation to the sport report? It was a proposal whereby honourable members would get a certain sum of money and they would be making the decisions in their own electorates—the decisions would not be in the minister's hands, looking after this government.

         It is interesting to watch the New South Wales right in relation to this performance—although those honourable members have obviously dumped the minister, because not one of them is here to support her. A cocoon has been wrapped around the minister over the last three months in an attempt to make her impenetrable to everyone or anything that comes along. But there is one thing that has now got under the guard of that cocoon and the New South Wales right. Does the minister know what that is? Does she know the one thing that is really going to sink her? It is the truth that will sink her. The truth is that she has misled this parliament for three months. She has scorned the Auditor-General, she has attacked his right to be an independent arbiter in this place and she has constantly blamed everyone bar herself for this performance.

The bucket has been tipped because she said to them that they would play no part in this whatsoever and that she would be making the bulk of the decisions. She has not come into this House yet and explained, in answer to a question from a member of the backbench last week, why it is that she accepted seven late applications when she had written to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and said that under no circumstances would she allow late applications to come in. Yet, seven went through and six out of those just happened to be in Labor marginals. Why should anyone believe what the minister puts on paper? Why would anyone believe her? There is only one answer to this; it is a very fraudulent little performance.

It is a matter that he will now regret. What he has done is implicate himself absolutely and totally in this $30-million fraud. The minister is going to implicate the Prime Minister, along with the minister's front bench colleagues, in what has now become known as `mategate' and `sports rorts'. Implicit in all of this is the fact that there are many honourable members behind the minister who have been party to this whole performance. So why does the minister not resign?

What has not been mentioned in this debate so far is that the very concept of Fightback meant that these policies were going to be destroyed. I have a certain amount of regard for some members of the opposition who, because of their commitment to the principles of their party, said, `We will not support any applications that come from our community'.

But where was the honourable member for Higgins? Something like five applications for funds were made from his electorate. And which one did he support? Which one did he know about? Having been caught—because he knew when he made his statement to the press—he came in here today and said that it was a glib exercise devoid of any integrity and honesty.

I am sick of being told by a bunch of political sleaze-bags who are too lazy to get off their seats. They should go into their electorates, recognise the needs and the demands and then be prepared to come in here and say, `Because I am stuck with Fightback, I might be opposed to this principle, but, please, I have a group of young people playing sports who need this'. So let us get back to the real issue.

The Liberal Party could not win the seat of Melbourne Ports if it started campaigning tomorrow because the mate of the honourable member for Higgins gave the party a bodgie candidate, and the honourable member knows it. The honourable member should come to my electorate of Melbourne Ports and have a look at the facilities. He should talk to his colleagues in state parliament and say, `This is an awful sports rort, so please do not go near the Hellas sports club and say how pleased and proud you are'. Their colours are blue and white—the same colours as the Liberal Party. Isn't that nice? He should say, `Do not drink the champagne; do not eat the food. Stand up and say, "We will not be there because this is all a big sports rort"'. What damnable hypocrisy!  What nonsense!

        The proposed government amendments change the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 to enable the rate of interest payable by the Commonwealth, under proposed subsections 65SA(1) and 65SB(1), to be determined by regulations. It is proposed that this clarification be provided to avoid confusion and controversy. The bill previously provided no guidelines on this matter. Oral advice from the Attorney-General's Department has indicated that, where the Commonwealth holds moneys in trust for the benefit of another—in this case, a vendor nursing home proprietor—it is legally necessary for the Commonwealth to pay interest at commercial rates. The bill as introduced did not specify how the rate of interest was to be calculated and which commercial rate was to apply.

         The proposed government amendments provide that the rate of interest to be payable by the Commonwealth will be determined by regulations. The proposed consequential regulations will provide that interest be calculated at the rate payable at the time by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for a term deposit of 90 days, the period which most nearly corresponds with the time moneys on which the interest is payable will be held by the Commonwealth.

         The other amendments of the schedule give effect to government undertakings to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in the course of the committee's consideration of the bill. These amendments are designed to ensure that the AMA, in recommending appointees under the legislation, consults widely with the relevant professional groups and that those groups are represented on the appropriate professional services review committees. The committee should agree to the amendments made by the Senate.

         —The seven bills before us provide for a national approach to the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and will replace the old scheme which operated under the jurisdictions of the eight states and territories. The need for such legislation has been discussed for many years, probably a quarter of a century. But it was only in July of 1991 that the states and territories were able to come together and agree on what has now become the common approach set out before us. The Commonwealth took over the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in July 1992 but the actual registration has, until this point, remained with the states.

         In July 1993, legislation supported by the coalition established the National Registration Authority, which has contributed to the development of this new legislation. The bills provide the NRA with its full range of functions and powers and represent the final stage in the development of a national registration scheme. They are supported by the agricultural and veterinary chemicals industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Commonwealth agencies involved in the scheme, and the state and territory agricultural agencies.

         The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill imposes the agvet code in the Australian Capital Territory. The states and the Northern Territory will legislate themselves to adopt the code and they will have 12 months within which to do so. In order to reduce the complexity of the bill, offences will continue to be offences against the laws of the states or territories, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be empowered to prosecute for offences.

         The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Bill provides a user-pays mechanism and the NRA is obliged to recover its full costs from industry. The government had originally said that such a requirement would be phased in over four years, but it is now anticipated that the scheme's costs will be fully recovered in 1995-96 and well over 80 per cent will be recovered in 1994-95. The NRA will be responsible for assessing whether a levy payment is required and the amount of that levy. Normally the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products.

The bill also allows the NRA to licence manufacturers of those chemicals.

The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure that it continues to meet current safety and performance standards. The authority may suspend or cancel the registration if it believes it is appropriate to do so. Permits to use unregistered chemicals may be issued for trials or experiments in order to determine whether an application for registration should be made. The legislation also allows the National Registration Authority to consider the results of any trials or experiments carried out in other countries. The objective is to remove unnecessary duplication and expense for companies which have developed and/or registered products overseas.

         The advantages of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are well acknowledged. As it was then known, the Bureau of Rural Resources in evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia claimed that if farm chemicals were not used, 30 per cent of the world's agricultural product would be lost in addition to the 20 to 40 per cent which was lost annually because of the effects of weeds, pests and diseases. The bureau said at that time:

        The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association, now known as Avcare, in evidence to the same committee, estimated that in 1988 the value of increased production by Australian farmers, resulting from the use of pesticides in their activities amounted to $3.2 billion per year. Avcare also estimated that the withdrawal of chemicals from Australian agriculture would have reduced farm output in 1988 by some $7 billion. The complete withdrawal of sheep blowfly treatments alone would have caused production losses of some $465 million per year. Avcare believes—and its belief is reinforced by evidence from the United States—that every dollar spent on agvet chemicals adds $4 to the value of agricultural production.

         It is estimated that in 1992-93, Australian farmers spent $720 million on agricultural chemicals and a further $290 million on veterinary chemicals—a total of just over $1 billion, boosting agricultural production by a massive $4 billion annually. The benefits, in other words, are extremely substantial. Reduced or minimum tillage in agricultural production, cropping production, provides a great example of the benefits of chemical to agriculture.

         , Professor Arthur and Mrs Jeanette Conacher of the University of Western Australia concluded that more than a decade of minimum tillage or reduced tillage had revealed some distinct advantages over conventional practices. These advantages included positive changes to soil properties, greater organic matter, improved soil structure, increased water infiltration, increased capacities on the part of the soil to store water and also to drain, reduced erosion, enhanced nutrient status and biological activity.

         The Senate select committee heard some concerns expressed by scientists about the annual application of chemicals and the potential for the build-up of residues in the soil with as yet unknown consequences. The Conachers shared this concern but said it appeared that the continued and judicious application of herbicides as one management tool amongst several could be justified. This conclusion was predicated on better user education, and the introduction of less environmentally disruptive herbicides and non-chemical alternatives. In practical terms, on Australia's farms, this means finding an appropriate and judicious mix of traditional mechanical tillage—which in its own way can be quite hard on soils; for example, I refer to the disruptive effect of ground engaging tools working through the ground at speeds of up to 10 kilometres an hour—and other techniques such as long fallowing, crop rotation and the incorporation of legumes, coupled with the chemical options before us.

         Ongoing study and research in this area will obviously produce more knowledge and better results as we proceed along the path of ensuring that we can manage sustainable development in agriculture in this country. I think the point is well taken that the wise and sensible use of chemicals has an extremely important part in maintaining agricultural production and, at the same time, helping to maintain the  quality and the diversity of our soils in this country—ancient and fragile as many of them are, and lacking in nutrient qualities and fertility.

         The Senate select committee recognised the serious environmental problems associated with land degradation and the considerable benefits that may arise in that regard as well from the use of herbicides in minimum tillage. Since the publication of much of that work in 1986, the continuing degradation of agricultural land and the financial pressures of the farm terms of trade crisis have encouraged a greater use of minimum tillage as a means of improving viability.

         Farmers are very much awake to the economic and environmental benefits of minimum tillage, particularly in conjunction with herbicides such as the environmentally friendly product Roundup, which is claimed to be non-residual in the soil. Roundup has dramatically reduced the amount of mechanical interaction with the soil in many parts of this country and, at the same time, it has allowed much better farming techniques in terms of the conservation of moisture and effective weed kill.

         The Conachers suggested that non-chemical alternatives should be used alongside the judicious use of herbicides and minimum tillage techniques in the management of crops. This is precisely the direction in which Australian agriculture is heading. Sometimes in this place we find that derogatory references are made to the way in which we have relied for so long upon agricultural exports, along with mining exports, for our wealth. References are made to these industries in a way that reflects the belief held by some that they are somehow low-tech and demeaning. In reality Australian agriculture is an enormous employer of technology and of modern methods. In many ways we can claim to lead the world in some of these areas.

         Just recently the media reported on an Australian company seeking permission to run field trials of cotton plants which have been genetically engineered to improve their resistance to caterpillars and, paradoxically, the herbicide Roundup. The company is confident that, if the trials are successful and the plants are released commercially, the chemicals used on Australia's very substantial cotton crop could be reduced. Fewer pesticides would be required and cotton growers would be able to use the relatively benign Roundup instead of herbicides in certain situations to clean up competing weeds.

         The Commonwealth has had a role in the regulation of these sorts of chemicals for over 20 years. Initially, regulation was undertaken under the umbrella of the Australian Agricultural Council and then the Commonwealth-state council of ministers had responsibility for these agricultural and veterinary chemicals. In 1988 the Commonwealth government agreed to coordinate the clearance of new agvet chemicals, but the states remained responsible for the registration of such clearance.

The states would retain responsibility for ensuring the proper use and control of the chemicals. So the Commonwealth has the responsibility of registration of the chemicals up to sale and it is the states' responsibility to control how those chemicals are laid and ascertain whether they meet proper state regulations on how they are used in the field.

This code will enable the registration of the agvet chemicals to be undertaken on a national basis by the National Registration Authority.

Consideration is currently being given to developing pest and disease strategies to reduce reliance on pesticides and develop integrated pest management strategies utilising all available means.

         The history of such drug approval and agricultural chemical approval in Australia is not one of which the nation can be proud. Whether we like it or not—I know there are segments of the community that do not like it—the simple fact is that agriculture has become extremely dependent on the chemical industry. It now is one of the most significant outlays in most farmers' budgets, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, be they involved in horticulture, broadacre farming or the raising of animals in an intensive style. Some would like to see that changed, but in the meantime Australia's competitive advantage in a world where in many places costs are substantially lower is in achieving maximum productivity in every arena of agriculture, and chemicals are a significant contributor.

It has never happened in Australia.

Under the legislation we are passing today, every cent of cost will end up being a cost to rural producers. The producers of the chemicals and the drugs being evaluated can afford to pay the charges if they can pass the costs on.

Four years later, 170 properties were still contaminated. In June last year DDT testing was discontinued because it was believed that the lesson had been learned.

         The legislation, however, has another side. It has the support of environmental organisations because it is about the safety of the food we eat, the fertility of our land and the purity of our environment. Substances that were once household names, such as dieldrin, tordon and DDT, are now identified as highly undesirable. Why were such substances permitted for open sale? The answer is that they did the job. No-one questioned what happened to these substances after the job was done. The old rule of the bush—`if 10 mls will kill the pest, 20 mls will do it better'—has often applied. We now know that these chemicals do not break down. They are very stable and, once they are in the food chain, they stay there; they are passed on from one level to another. Certainly, the chemical industry has become more sensitive to environmental problems and, in its own interest, it is spending money on research and development. But this growth in knowledge and awareness must continue and continuing vigilance must be exercised.

Though the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 had many advantages over previous arrangements, further moves to streamline registration and control of ag and vet chemicals to make the operations more efficient and standards uniform are necessary.

         Prior to 1988, the Commonwealth had no specific legislation covering the clearance and registration of new agricultural and veterinary chemicals in this country. This meant that each of the states needed to make its own assessments on the efficacy and the suitability of ag and vet chemicals, to perform its own tests and to carry out its own registrations. This was obviously a costly and inefficient way to manage the use of ag and vet chemicals in Australia, often requiring duplication of legislation and assessment. It also meant that uniformity of legislation across the states and territories was virtually non-existent, and it clearly did need change.

         In 1988, with the introduction of the ag and vet chemicals act, the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council was formed as the national body responsible for determining major policy issues relating to the clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It could grant or withdraw clearances for the registration of chemical products for use in states and territories for specified purposes under specified conditions, determine or vary the conditions to which such clearances were subject, and evaluate the effects of the use of chemical products in states and territories.

         Although this new system had many advantages over its predecessor, the Commonwealth and the state governments believed that it too could be streamlined. Problems were identified with the composition of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. Endorsement by the council did not stop the overlap between the Commonwealth and state/territory legislation—meaning that products had to be registered separately and that there was a lack of suitable avenues for complaint which, in an industry involving chemicals and their use, could be considered essential.

         In mid-1992 the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced the formation of a National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, which would have an independent chairman and a board drawn from a range of interest groups, including the state governments. The move at that time allowed the board of the authority to contribute to the development of the legislation that it would administer. The preamble of the bill clearly demonstrates the reason and the need for legislation of this type. It says:

This bill will be adopted, as will the other six, through complementary legislation by the states and the Northern Territory.

         The agvet code will help in the evaluation, approval, control and supply of active constituents for proposed or existing agricultural and veterinary chemical products and in the evaluation, registration and control of the manufacturing and supply of those products. It is important to remember that the NRA can reconsider its approval and its registration of an ag or vet chemical product at any time. That is an essential part of the legislation: allowing the NRA to revisit any of its previous decisions in light of new information or new research which may come to light. For example, clause 55(2) requires a notice of suspension or cancellation to contain particular information in certain circumstances, including where the reason, or one of the reasons, for the suspension or cancellation was that the continued use of, or other dealing with, the product might be an undue hazard for the safety of people, be likely to have a harmful effect on people or be likely to have an unintended effect on animals, plants or the environment.

         In my electorate at the moment there are many farmers who are experiencing great difficulties with buffalo fly. Some say that they are at their worst in 20 years. Current veterinary chemicals for the control of buffalo fly require direct spraying onto the animal. According to the farmers, it costs about $1.20 per dose and it remains effective for only two or three days. Given the large herds, the cost and the time needed for coverage, most herds are not being treated as often as they might be. I have been told that the flies have been causing such a problem that cattle are rubbing their necks on fences or retaining walls and are sometimes injuring themselves quite badly. They have difficulty in sleeping and after receiving treatment they simply lie down and rest. They have no interest in eating; they are simply relieved. One farmer told me that the look of relief can really been see on their faces.

         Ciba, an agricultural and veterinary chemical company, has applied for registration through the NRA of a new trial product called Spike. I am told Spike would cost about 60c a dose and it is promoted as being able to provide up to four months of coverage and protection from buffalo fly. It works as an ear tag releasing a measured dose of diazinon each day, which the cattle then spread around the rest of their bodies.

Many cattle producers are making strong approaches to the New South Wales minister for agriculture to be able to use the product on a provisional basis also in New South Wales. This highlights the need for consistency of legislation of this type, for national legislation. Once this legislation is in place and working to its full potential, there will not be any need for graziers in northern New South Wales to look across the border to see what new products are available and their effect. There will be no need for it to occur the other way around, with Queensland producers looking over the border to New South Wales to see what might be of assistance to them.

         This important legislation will provide, for the first time, for the whole of the nation to be covered by a single code and a single standard for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It shows a mature approach to legislation by the Commonwealth government. This is legislation of integrity which has enormous potential for the future. The world sees Australia as a provider of agricultural products that are different to the rest of the world because of their clean nature. The preservation and enhancement of that observation by other countries is extremely important. If we can produce agricultural products that are known throughout Asia and the rest of the world as cleaner and better, and if we can show them to be that way through testing procedures, national agreements and national standards such as these, other countries will not only demand our products but will also pay a premium for them.

         The move to nationally regulate the registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products has taken shape over a number of years. It is not before time. The frustration that has resulted from there being a series of bodies overseeing the registration and control of veterinary chemicals has been highlighted by previous speakers. The legislation just goes to show the cooperation which is sometimes needed to overcome the previous methods of administration and bureaucracy which we have in our country.

I think almost every speaker in the debate so far has raised an issue of relevance to his or her electorate or given examples of where the different bodies involved to date in registering and approving chemical control on the farm have had different standards and processes of registration. Consequently, the different bureaucracies have been viewed with a degree of cynicism by the electorate.

         What the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) may have been attempting to say in his address was that we must be careful that we do not implement just a centralised body which takes on some of the bugs in the previous system. There is already a system that can take on board the trials and evaluations that have been done in other countries. At the same time, we need to be very cautious about how we take on board their trials and registration procedures.

         The establishment of the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council in 1988 resulted from an agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory in which the Commonwealth agreed to the clearance of agricultural and veterinary chemicals with the states. Under this agreement, the states remained responsible for subsequent registration. An agreement was reached to form the national registration scheme at the 1990 Premiers Conference. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth was to be responsible for the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals up to the point of retail sale. The national evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals began in July 1992 by an administrative arrangement between the states and the Commonwealth. Under this arrangement, states continued to be responsible for the actual registration of chemical products. It was a very slow evolution. The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA, was established in June 1993 and will administer the regulation and control of agricultural chemicals across Australia up to the point of sale.

The bill, through the federalism mechanism, applies the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for the purpose of uniformly interpreting the agricultural and veterinary code as applied in each jurisdiction. The Commonwealth administrative law package will apply to the agricultural and veterinary code in each jurisdiction. Offences against the bill continue to be an offence against the laws of the states or territories—so in some ways we have not encroached on their territory—although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be empowered to prosecute offences where seen fit.

         Undoubtedly, labels on chemicals or any product are of some interest to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), who is at the table. Certainly, the approval of labels for agricultural chemicals is even more important considering the nature of the contents of the containers and the problems that can arise if they are used or misused deliberately or accidentally. Tragically, a number of cases across Australia have come to the attention of the authorities as a result of accidents and almost ignorance of the proper handling procedures.

         Fortunately, we are slowly setting in place—probably too slowly—some training schemes which will enable farmers to be a little more aware of the nature of some of the chemicals they are using and the very strong need for correct handling procedures to be in place. Sometimes the misuse of chemicals does not directly affect human beings; sometimes it can be the ongoing consequences, as a number of speakers have mentioned. I think the honourable member for O'Connor, in particular, mentioned the build-up of resistance to either herbicides or pesticides. Misuse or overuse of chemicals can also hasten chemical resistance in the target organism.

         I think it needs to be reinforced that it is not good enough to take on board a product which has been registered or is being used in another country by simply saying, `It has been registered there for 10 years; let's have it over here in Australia'. We need to evaluate the product in our conditions; we need to have a look at the process which led it to be registered in that country; and we need to see whether there has been proper follow-up evaluation in that country. Again, adopting a chemical without those three aspects and without having further trials within Australia would be tantamount to negligence.

         Undoubtedly, that is what is in the mind of the authorities when they are very slow to issue registrations or permits for chemicals that have yet to be evaluated in Australia. I do not think we can step back from being cautious about that. We have to conduct our own trials to ensure that the chemical, or in some cases a biological control agent, does what we anticipate it will do and it does not have any adverse side effects. If the NRA sees fit, it may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered chemical product.

         The bill will also recognise the cost of scientific data required to support continued chemical registration with compensation provisions introduced which will apply in certain circumstances. The intention is to recognise research and development costs associated with updating data packages when such data may also support other manufactured products. The provisions apply specifically to data requested by the NRA that does not have patent protection. A number of safeguards have been built into the agvet code to prevent the commercial abuse of data while ensuring that both the provider of the call-up data and a secondary applicant are treated equitably.

         The NRA will be able to control the possession of chemical products. It will be an offence to supply unregistered chemical products or to supply products in contravention of the conditions of the registration. In other words, chemicals will have to be in the proper containers and have labels on them as well. The NRA may issue recall notices requiring persons to stop supplying a product if a chemical product has been supplied in contravention of the agvet code as well as taking action to deal with unsold stock. It is a pity that we have not been able to make that last aspect retrospective. I think there are probably too many chemicals lying around on farms simply because no-one is seeking the responsibility to have them removed, in many cases, from the hazardous situations, containers and so forth that they have been left lying in.

         The bill also provides a mechanism for persons to obtain a permit that would allow the use of a chemical product in circumstances that would otherwise be an offence. This permit system will allow the trialing and testing of agricultural and veterinary products to assist a newly developed product. I concur with my colleague the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) in his comments on the trialing of the implant system known as Spike for the treatment of buffalo fly. The particular pest, if I could politely call it that, has developed some degree of resistance to the known pour-on chemicals that have been used for the last number of years. As that resistance has built up, their effectiveness in treating has decreased. In some cases, we are getting rhetorical examples where the protection has only lasted for seven or eight days. When they initially started using the chemicals, the protection against the buffalo fly would last for something like 21 days or even longer.

         I might take some time to comment on the problem regarding the trialing and permit system that the Queensland department of agriculture used to use. Under the previous administration that this bill is replacing, the various states could issue permits and would go it alone in their own trials. With this package of bills in place the central authority will issue a permit for a trial in certain circumstances, which will mean that the product can be more closely monitored. The overall cost to the industry will be reduced by not having duplication but, at the same time, will ensure that the trial is conducted very scientifically and that necessary precautions are taken. Again, it comes back to the need for caution and not registering something which does lead to problems further down the track.

         Some frustration has been expressed by farmers on the north coast in that their neighbours across the border have been able to access the ear tags to implant into their stock and, hence, have better protection against the buffalo fly.

         A very small trial has already been initiated on the north coast to check that product. It will involve a period of treatment of some 132 head of cattle. They will be treated on a normal set basis and then the residue levels in those stock will be checked. That in itself is certainly good news, but it highlights in some ways the old system of duplication of research. I do understand that the research that has been carried out in Queensland has been completed. The residue levels and so forth that need to be checked—they have to be checked very carefully—have been completed and the results are under consideration. I anticipate, though I cannot anticipate completely, that registration of that product will be made soon. That will be good news for beef producers on the north coast and, indeed, right across Queensland. If that product, as I anticipate, does obtain registration, it will certainly cut down considerably management of and the stress on livestock. It will certainly be good news.

The NRA will have adequate enforcement powers in respect of the agvet code. The bill also provides for the process of appeal. An applicant can appeal against a decision made by the NRA and have the decision reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         The bills before the House, as I stated, certainly encapsulate a number of areas and bring them together. In relation to a range of issues generally being covered by different states and territories, we will see not so much a tighter control but a more efficient system in operation to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and that the scheme can be monitored to ensure that the particular scientific information needed is gained and that the particular controls over chemicals are put in place.

         Probably one of the biggest problems we have had with any chemical used in Australia—this was mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor and one or two other speakers—is build-up of resistance. It has been seen clearly by beef cattle producers in their use of pour-ons for buffalo fly and by those in the wool industry with the development of resistance to chemicals by the blowfly. They have seen this sort of thing before. Chemicals being used and handled correctly reduces the speed with which that build-up of resistance can occur.

         —I rise to participate in the debate on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and six other bills because of a recent experience I had. In order to do my domestic bit as a parent, three weeks ago I trotted along to the local vet with the family dog to have it spayed. Our vet, a recent graduate from the Western Australia University, Dr Fiona White, in a very obliging manner on that Saturday morning said, `Would you like to witness the operation?'. So with my 11-year-old in tow we stood there while the dog was laid out on the table and the appropriate spaying operation was gone through and everyone was thoroughly entertained.

         Exercising less sensitivity than I expected from our vet, she said to me, `By the way, this dog has a fair dose of fleas'. I was mildly offended, but I could not deny the obvious evidence that the dog did have fleas. She said, `In three weeks time, when the stitches come out, you ought to have the dog appropriately treated'. So on Saturday, with a now spayed and stitches-free dog, I acquired from the local hardware store 200 millilitres of Malawash, recommended for horse and dog fleas.

         In the old days on the land, it was easy. One could either run the dog through the sheep dip at the end of the run or find some way of treating it, but here I was in a suburban property with no reasonable way in which to treat the dog. I was looking around for some way to dip what is effectively a bitser. So, using what I hope others would find to be commendable enterprise, I emptied the garbage out of the plastic garbage bin, filled up what I thought was about a 20-litre drum of water, poured it into the bin—it was not quite enough for the dog, so I added a bit more—dropped in the 200 millilitres, up-ended the dog a couple of times, tossed it out and off it ran. Of course, it has been remarkably happy ever since.

         I reflected on the fact that it is probably not the commercial users of chemicals that need to be brought into line but the domestic users. What do we do in our suburban front and back yards when we have a weed problem? We add a bit of Roundup to the bucket and put it in the old Rega single nozzle spray, add a little more Roundup—we might as well be sure that all the weeds die—and run around and treat the weeds. But the sense of precision in chemical application that is characteristic of commercial use is lacking in domestic use, as I have just confessed to the House was my experience in treating both the dog and the weeds.

         I think it is time the House stood in recognition of the relatively careful commercial use that is currently exhibited by producers who have to deal with agricultural chemicals. It is easy for those of us who are no longer regularly exposed to agricultural chemicals and who just have to use them on the occasional Saturday, perhaps two or three times a year, to take a fairly casual view of the 200-millilitre bottle of Malawash or Roundup, whatever the case may be.

         There is a really danger with agricultural chemicals when they are being held by either a domestic or commercial user in their concentrated form. Once diluted into the sheep dip or spray plant, the chemical represents a much less hazardous product than it did in its concentrated form.

         The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), in his contribution to this debate, said that it had been his experience that so many commercial users, particularly farmers, said, `Oh, well, 10 millilitres of the product will kill; let's add 20 millilitres and make sure we kill even better'. But that has not been my experience of the commercial use of agricultural chemicals. In fact, because of the simple reality that doubling up on agricultural and veterinary chemicals costs the farmer enormous sums of money, the farmer tends to focus on the minimum use of agricultural chemicals rather than the maximum. It is the domestic users—people like us, people who use these chemicals in a non-professional capacity—who are much more likely to effectively abuse them.

I have been through the course. It took only two days. As I passed it, I suspect that most farmers could pass it. This course is not currently mandatory, but farmer organisations around Australia are encouraging their farmers to participate in it, simply so that the safe use of agricultural chemicals will become the norm and so that every farmer picking up a can of agricultural chemical will be able to read and interpret the label and be certain that what he is applying represents its minimum use.

         The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who participated in this debate, said that he felt there ought to be a greater emphasis on totally biological practice in agriculture. I remind the honourable member for Lyons, honourable members in the House and those in the gallery that Australian agriculture is now more focused towards biological agriculture than it has ever been in its entire history. The experience of most fruit growers has led them to believe that they are committed to some form of biological control. Where biological control fails because there are not sufficient introduced parasites to minimise the pest, we find that the introduced parasites tend to be aided by integrated control rather than wiped out by broad based chemical control.

         The major scourge of the citrus industry—my own industry—used to be red scale which was once controlled by enveloping every citrus tree in a canvass tent and blowing cyanide, a highly toxic gas which was so notorious during World War II, in under that tent and killing everything that happened to be caught under there: birds, dogs, red scale—the lot. Subsequently, that very labour intensive system of pest control was replaced by what was regarded as a much more comfortable technique—merely saturating the tree with malathion or parathene as the case may be. As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, that too was a broad based pesticide that wiped out everything with which it came into contact.

         The legislation we are currently dealing with reflects the new sense of caution that the entire nation, particularly the commercial operators, has about agricultural and veterinary chemical use. As an alternative to agricultural and veterinary chemicals, we find a range of people in the pome fruit industry, for example, choosing to use pheromone lures—the sex hormones of the female codling moth, as the case may be, to attract the male codling moth into a lure. This minimises the need for any form of chemical control for the codling moth and effectively produces an even less chemically exposed apple or pear.

         Examining the insect-borne diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, plague, sleeping sickness and encephalitis, Dr. Edwards notes that between 1950 and 1970, DDT had either eradicated or controlled malaria and other diseases in regions of Asia and Africa with some 2 billion inhabitants. In Sri Lanka, for example, 3 million cases of malaria were reduced by DDT in 10 years to only 17 cases, and deaths from malaria dropped from 12,000 a year to zero.

I am merely wanting to validly create the impression that we would have a very different world had it not been for the impact of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. There would not be a farmer who wants dieldrin or DDT reintroduced as a result of the damage already done to our cattle industry. As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has said, we have to recognise that 55 million people have a better lifestyle thanks to the impact of Australian agriculture.

If people are unhappy with any of these decisions, they have the authority to call the NRA to account. Those sorts of provisos ensure that the chemicals products that will be used by Australian agriculture in the future will not adversely affect the crops we are spraying or the ultimate consumers.

         The passage of these bills represents a significant development in the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. The history of the legislation has been canvassed very well by previous speakers. The introduction of this legislation represents another milestone in the government's program of micro-economic reform. It represents an effort by this government to produce benefits not only for agriculture and the chemical industry but for all Australians by improving the safeguards placed on these chemicals. It also contributes to the increased competitiveness of Australian industries. Each of us has been aware of the move by many food manufacturers in Australia to ensure that the food manufactured and exported from Australia is marked and clearly recognised as being pollutant free.

         The legislation has provisions which were not possible under the previous two-tiered clearance system. For example, firstly, it places controls on the import, export and manufacture of agvet chemicals and, secondly, there are compensation provisions for certain data which will underpin the review of the existing chemicals program. Also, the legislation contains additional provisions aimed at improved efficiency, including statutory deadlines for the processing of applications and penalties should these requirements not be met. These far-reaching changes achieved in so short a time would not have been possible if it had not been for the cooperative efforts of many groups: the rural sector groups, consumers, the chemical industry and, in particular, the states and territories. This cooperative effort will continue with the complementary arrangement of responsibility for registration up to the stage of retail sale resting with the Commonwealth and responsibility for control and use resting with the states and territories.

Whilst the use of such agents have produced bumper crops in the horticultural industry and the sugar industry and have done so much to upgrade the success of, for example, the beef industry, there is nevertheless an increasing awareness within the community that people should be concerned about the level of pesticides in the food chain. There is also an awareness that we as a nation need to address much more of our scientific research—CSIRO can be much more involved in this—towards ensuring that the level of chemicals used in the production of the food of our country is kept to the minimum consistent with the highest standards of human health.

They recognise that quality is an open sesame to developing export markets around the world.

         I hope that the Australian authorities, the CSIRO and this government will continue to improve on the measures that have already been taken to ensure that the role of chemicals and other agents in the production of our foodstuff is consistent with the highest standards of health. I thank honourable members who made a contribution to the debate. I commend the bills to the House.

         —The legislative item before the House refers to a batch of bills; namely, the Offshore Minerals Bill, the Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill and, lastly, the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill. The main bill, the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993, aims to provide a common mining code for all offshore Commonwealth and state jurisdictions in respect of non-petroleum exploration and production.

         The bill itself establishes a uniform code for Commonwealth jurisdictions which extend beyond the outer limits of states' coastal waters to the edge of the continental shelf. The bill, however, anticipates that mirror or complementary legislation will be passed by the states—as well as the Northern Territory—thereby bringing uniformity across all offshore minerals jurisdictions. The Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill repeals the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981. This act is replaced by the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993, to which I have just referred. The bill also effects changes to other relevant bills to align terminology and definitions. In addition, the Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 adjusts the various relevant fees related acts: the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1981, the Offshore Minerals (Mining Licence Fees) Act, the Offshore Minerals (Registration Fees) Act 1981, and the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Works Authority Fees) Act 1981.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you will agree it is important to lay down the formalities and effects of the legislation presently before the House, however tedious that may be, for all of us to better understand. The level of fees will be set by regulations to cover future rises in administration costs. There could well be concerns that the Commonwealth has set up a system whereby it can win open-ended rights to levy new taxes on the industry as a result of this new legislation. Importantly, however, the bill claims a ceiling will be placed on future rises. More importantly, the fees collected under the bill are targeted to meet the administration of the principal act which is carried out by the states, not by the Commonwealth.

         The Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 introduces a new form of retention licence and provides for an annual fee to cover administrative costs. The retention licence enables a permit holder to retain a proved mineral deposit without working it if there is good reason for delaying moves towards production stages. Such a situation can occur at a time when it is uncommercial to develop a lease area and a company or joint venture requires an interval to reassess its market opportunities.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill claims the fee structure for the new retention licence is consistent with other fee structures in the existing acts covering exploration permits and production licences. Consequently, it does not—on my reading of the bill—represent an onerous requirement.

         The Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill amends the existing act which refers to the principal act which is being substituted by the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993. This is a purely technical amendment and does not affect the royalty liabilities of mining interests or the distribution of those royalties. Such is the legislative framework of the bills before the House.

         Before I proceed, I should point out that the Offshore Minerals Bill affects only mineral exploration in offshore areas, not petroleum exploration. Consequently, the bill deals with any future mining and minerals production activities in offshore areas, as does the act it replaces.

         I understand that there are currently only two or so active offshore mineral exploration efforts under way. One is in the mouth of the Ord River in the Kimberley and the other is in South Australia's Spencer Gulf. Both exploration activities are in search of alluvial deposits—mainly diamonds, but also gold and platinum. I suppose these are speculative at the moment and restricted to areas adjacent to offshore river mouths in the main, but it would be hoped that these efforts by small companies utilising a high level of geological skill acquired from inland exploration will be successful in the long run. Regardless, these offshore projects do herald the emergence of an exploration push into the offshore regions of Australia which ultimately will be of enormous national benefit. This parliament should applaud their frontier work in this regard.

         Over the next few decades, minerals exploration will move offshore, and the bill will become increasingly relevant as time passes. The bill before the House represents many years of effort by state and federal governments and the resources industries to devise a workable offshore minerals exploration regime. The expertise and advice of the state governments to the specific industries involved and their associations, such as the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, should be commended. The original principal act, passed in the early 1980s, did not provide such a framework. It sat around gathering dust for most of the decade until it was proclaimed, from memory, in 1990. No sooner was it up and running than it was subject, at the request of the states and the mining and minerals sector, to a barrage of amendments which required its total rewriting. This is important to note.

         In the light of the Mabo legislation, we saw a great deal of acrimonious debate about the relationship between the states and the Commonwealth about land management regimes and the power of the grant of title. In the course of that debate, we were told by the government how irresponsible the states were, and their responsibilities for land management were pilloried around the place. But here we are celebrating the passage of a key piece of legislation bearing on key land use principles, touching on all the crucial issues, for example, the issuance of proper title, which is a result of a process characterised by goodwill and cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. This is the model of cooperation which the Mabo legislation should have been couched in.

         The Offshore Minerals Bill proves to all that complex issues of title concerning state and Commonwealth responsibilities can be worked out cooperatively and competently without resort to acrimony and a usurpation of one government's rights by another. The bill before the House is testimony that the divisive history of the Mabo legislation need not have taken place. If we had accepted the High Court's decision on its own terms and worked to integrate that judgment into the existing system of land management on a cooperative Commonwealth-state basis, this nation would have been spared what has become a tumultuous experience which has struck at the confidence of the resources sector and caused enormous anxiety in the community.

         The then Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in his second reading speech applauds the constructive help of the states in reconciling the competing land use and titles issues which the push for a uniform minerals code for offshore areas naturally gives rise to. It recognises and complements the states' expertise and responsibilities in the administration of the land management system in helping to resolve the sticky issue of title jurisdictions, and well it should; that is where the experience and the constitutional sovereignty reside. When we look at this bill and its history, we should also look at the Mabo bill and wonder what might have been if the government had embarked on its response to the High Court's decision in a cooperative rather than combative style with the states.

         The current act, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981, is a consequence of the offshore constitutional settlement adopted at the Premiers Conference in 1979 in which the respective jurisdictions for state and Commonwealth waters were defined for purposes of mineral exploration and production. The key bill, the Offshore Minerals Bill, replaces that act, as the states found it an unsatisfactory vehicle for introducing a uniform mining code for both state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Offshore Minerals Bill and its associated bills are therefore the product of several years of Commonwealth-state negotiations through the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council process. ANZMEC agreed to the amendments to the existing act in 1990. The new bill reflects those agreed amendments.

         The Offshore Minerals Bill will provide model legislation for the states to implement their corresponding legislation in their coastal jurisdictions. Importantly, the bill does not affect key principles which operate in the existing act and which are critical for the states. These principles include, firstly, that all offshore mineral activity in the Commonwealth area adjacent to state waters is governed by a joint authority consisting of the relevant state and Commonwealth minister. Secondly, the joint authorities are responsible for major decisions relating to the grants of title. Thirdly, the day-to-day administration of Commonwealth legislation is carried out by the states, for which they are compensated through the various fees on exploration, retention and production permits and licences. Fourthly, the existing 60:40 royalty split in favour of the states is retained.

Again, I would like to highlight the bill's commitment to this principle and its recognition of the public benefit which arises from streamlined and simplified titles grant processes. Again, this is all in sharp contrast to the odious and complex administrative arrangements which the Mabo legislation has imposed on the mining industry. On the one hand, this key piece of legislation signals the value of simplified and streamlined processes for granting titles, exploration permits and retention and production licences. On the other hand, in respect of the Mabo legislation, we see the government undercutting its publicly stated position. What the government giveth, the government surely doth relentlessly and predictably take away.

         The key issue in the legislation before the House is the establishment of a common minerals royalty system for minerals production activities in state and Commonwealth waters. This contentious issue is not referred to in the bill but is left for future discussions between the states and the Commonwealth. There is then more work to come out of the legislation. The issue of the proper royalty regime is a complex one. I can understand that the government would be more likely to opt for an extension of the existing resource rent tax system, but, equally so, I can foresee that the states might prefer a different system—possibly a hybrid royalty system including an ad valorem based royalty and a profit related mechanism. These matters will need to be worked through, as in the earlier cooperative ANZMEC process.

         This bill does something which should be applauded; it is written in plain English. This is very important, because it gives everybody the opportunity to understand the bill and it gives far less grounds for anyone to argue that they did not understand it. In saying this, I pay tribute to the Hon. Mark Nevill, a member of the upper House in Western Australia. Mark, who was born in the Kimberleys, is an honours graduate in geology. He rewrote in plain English the Mines Act in Western Australia. It is an indictment of both the government and the industry that they did not take this up immediately, because the mining act in Western Australia is a fairly convoluted document. It is good and pleasing to see that this legislation tackles that aspect. The reader's guide to the legislation is an invaluable little handbook which makes the legislation very easy to follow.

         The shadow minister, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), talked about cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth. I, too, applaud it. However, it should be remembered that only the states have the power to manage land; the Commonwealth simply does not have the facility. In passing, I say in respect of Mabo that it should be remembered that one High Court judge said there was no native title. Three judges said there was native title in respect of the Murray Islands. Three said that they thought it would have some application for the whole of the Australia, although they went on to say that, for various reasons, they thought it would be extremely limited.

         However, when it comes to seeking alluvial minerals, the dangers of pollution are much, much less. In the pursuit of alluvial diamonds or gold—in fact, just about any heavy material—it is unlikely that any chemicals would be used. Certainly no chemicals would be used in the treating situation. In heavy media separation, the heavy media is isolated. It is an inert material. If there were a spill from a boat, in most cases it would lie harmlessly on the bottom of the ocean. The environmental damage or dangers from this sort of mining are simply minuscule.

         Since by its nature most of this exploration will take place in the mouths of large rivers, what one might call the visual impact of mining is also of very little consequence. When the mighty Ord or the Burdekin run, they will transport into the ocean material which will look like mud—I guess it is mud—in volumes incomprehensible to man.

Anything that man does in that environment simply has to be discounted. We must therefore be very sure that the righteous zealots, who have been so prominent in environmental matters in Australia in the past, do not hold sway in this environment protection agency.

The benefits of this uniform legislation will far outweigh any potential dangers. This is a good example of what can result from the sort of consultation that the shadow minister referred to.

The particular provision to which I refer may have been written in anticipation of the High Court extending its recommendations at some future date. It is unlikely that that will occur—perhaps I should say that I hope it is unlikely—because I believe that at least some of the High Court judges have been somewhat chastened by the outcry at their decision in respect of native title and it is unlikely that there will be any significant extension of influence into the offshore area.

The reality—the absolute truth—is that mining in Australia covers an infinitesimal part of the landscape. It is certainly far less in total than the metropolitan area of a city like Perth.

I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking in support of these bills before the House. I believe that they will better suit the needs of the offshore minerals industry.

         As we have heard tonight, the particular bills follow a comprehensive joint review of the act with the states and the Northern Territory, leading to a large number of amendments that were agreed to by the Australian and New Zealand Minerals Energy Council in 1990. These amendments have been the basis of the six bills that constitute the package of offshore minerals bills of 1993, four of which are the subject of debate before the House tonight.

         The passage of these bills will give us a consolidated and consistent regime for minerals exploration; a regime that should speed the way for greater exploration and possible exploitation of Australia's seabed minerals. It will be able to do this by bringing the act into line with modern mining administration, principally through a process of simplifying the existing provisions of the act, introducing new provisions to make the act more effective and, importantly, as has been stressed by two earlier speakers, rewriting the act in plain English.

         I trust that this particular piece of legislation will become a model for such legislation in the future. Since Federation in this country we have probably had bills written about very complex pieces of public administration in a way that only highly paid QCs and barristers could possibly understand. We would all applaud the move in recent years in so many areas—not only in public administration but also in the insurance industry—to make sure that people who are interested in subjects are able to read them in a way that they can clearly comprehend.

         The bills will also provide a model for mirror state and Northern Territory legislation—legislation some states have been reluctant to enact so long as the act remained in its present form. So, to the extent that this act becomes a catalyst for that particular impact, I think it is very good for this nation. I have often said in debates that the sooner we get away from this notion that we are six self-governing colonies and think of ourselves as the Commonwealth of Australia the better we will be. This act is a step in the right direction.

         What makes all this so important is that, while the Australian seabed remains still largely unexplored, it is believed to contain valuable deposits of alluvial diamonds and heavy mineral sands. The development of a viable offshore mining industry, including the associated technology required to harvest these potential deposits, makes this a pioneer industry that is certainly well worth encouraging in this country. Its development would increase the mining industry's contribution to the Australian economy beyond its already significant level.

         Whilst it is quite fashionable, and indeed laudable, to talk about our success as a nation in boosting exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, putting the policies in place to achieve this growth has been one of the great success stories of this government. But we should not forget that our combined resource and primary industries sector continues to be a major export earner for this nation. A well-balanced economy obviously needs strong performances from not only the manufacturing sector, but also the great agricultural and mining industries that have made this country so great in the past.

         While our exports of manufactured goods continue to grow, accounting for about 29 per cent of Australia's total exports in 1992-93, the prospect of the resource sector is also looking up. I had an opportunity to look at some of the latest figures from ABARE showing the contribution of the relative sectors towards total values, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of overall exports. I think it is significant that merchandise exports account for $13.8 billion, rural exports account for $19.4 billion and resource exports account for $30.3 billion out of a total export of $62.94 billion. That is based on ABARE figures from 1992-93. We can see from those figures that almost 50 per cent of the total figure represents the great resource section of the Australian economy.

         Recently, a very successful Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics Outlook conference confirmed that the commodity price sector had generally been firming up in this country across both the resource and the agricultural sectors. I am sure that honourable members from both sides of this parliament will be encouraged by that. People, particularly from the agricultural side of Australia, have certainly been doing it very tough in recent years with a combination of falling export income and, in many cases, difficulties from the natural environment. ABARE believes that the outlook is looking more optimistic now than it has for some time, and that is something all of us in this House would applaud. That is something that those of us who represent vast regional and rural areas of Australia have been very pleased to hear.

         This improved outlook has also been enhanced by the successful GATT outcome, which is particularly good news not only in the agricultural sector, where there has been so much emphasis, but also in the mining sector. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that the gains to the mining industry, as a result of the GATT arrangements, are upwards of $2 billion. Given the need to address our current account difficulties, that will obviously be a very big plus over the coming years. There are also opportunities for the value adding industries which the mining industry sector is developing. Those industries will receive a significant slice of the extra benefits that are available through  manufactures.

         There is one other interesting part of the legislation which holds particular interest for me as a former minister for Australia's external territories. I have noticed tonight we are seeing the extension of the definition of `adjacent areas' under the act to include the areas adjacent to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as well as Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is significant, given the way in which the government has moved over recent years, to see that they are incorporated, particularly the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, into mainstream elements of Australian public administration, but that they are also, if you like, beneficiaries of this new piece of legislation. Apparently these were not included in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, on which the present act is based, because the offshore areas were not considered to be prospective for offshore petroleum.

         Once again I am pleased, as I said at the outset, to join my colleagues from both sides of the House in congratulating the minister responsible for bringing forth this legislation. I was pleased to hear the major contribution by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gippsland, during the debate tonight. The fact that a particular piece of legislation is being supported by both sides of parliament is a fact that I often use within my electorate to explain to people that what they see in question time is not necessarily representative of the total number of debating hours in the House during any day of sitting. But the vast majority of the legislation is in fact legislation that the opposition can support and, at times, where there is not that support, it is possible to accommodate some of its concerns. In this particular case that is not a problem. Once again I commend the legislation to my colleagues from both sides of the House.

         —I thank those speakers who have just made comments on this Offshore Minerals Bill and cognate bills on behalf of the government and, particularly, on behalf of the opposition. I notice that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) in referring to the legislation, when I was watching the debate on the screen, certainly stated that it has been a model for legislation as far as consultation with the states and the cooperation that is going to be there with the states and their legislation are concerned.

On behalf of the government in the summing up, I would like to make a number of comments.

         The enactment of this particular piece of legislation will provide another element in our government's program of micro-economic reform. The bills themselves have already been covered by one of our speakers and have had a lengthy consultation not only with the states but also with the Northern Territory. Both the substance and the style of the bills before the House have provided—as I have made comment on—a model for complementary state legislation. The enactment of state legislation in due course will also provide, we believe, a very common mining code for offshore minerals right around Australia.

         The bill itself, I have now been informed, does not introduce any major changes in policy, but it provides streamlined and improved procedures for the administration of the offshore mining of minerals. It will serve very well the growing interest in offshore minerals exploration and production. Many of the improved procedures have been suggested by the states which administer the legislation on behalf of the Commonwealth and which have that practical experience in administering mining legislation.

         We on this side are very satisfied that the bills are consistent with the Mabo legislation. In fact, clause 43 provides that a licence under the bill does not extinguish native title, but native title is subject to the rights conferred by the licence. Clause 44 of the bill provides that operators must respect native title rights. It is also pleasing that, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), has noted, for once it is written in plain English so that people do have an opportunity of understanding at first glance the intent of the bills without going into a lot of legal jargon as to how it is going to be, in the future, explained by other people who have a differing of opinion. I am pleased to recommend the bills to the House, and on behalf of the minister thank those speakers who have made a contribution and particularly the opposition for supporting the legislation.

         This bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993, proposes a series of changes primarily to the Veterans' Entitlements Act, with minor consequential amendments to a series of related acts such as the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. This bill proposes to issue a seniors card to persons who are of service pension age but are ineligible to receive a pension, to enable them to have access to concessional benefits in pharmaceutical, optometry and hearing services. This card will give certain low income, non-service pensioners and retirees who do not meet the residency requirements for the age service pension access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits, hearing aid concessions and entitle them to dental and optometry services. It is estimated this proposal will assist a total of 10,000 veterans and dependants.

Other consequences of the bill include: the use of oral or written, rather than just written, withdrawal of all types of claims; the alignment of carers' pensions with other types of pensions to allow for the carer's pension to be withdrawn if the pensioner has not drawn instalments for over six months; the exemption of payments made by the New South Wales Medically-Acquired HIV Trust from consideration in the income test; the alignment of the amount of recoverable overpayment where an administrative charge may apply with the amount of overpayment which may be subject to a waiver by the Repatriation Commission; and consequential and minor amendments to schedule 1 of the act relating to the introduction of the seniors health card, to schedule 2 relating to the assessments of compensation overpayments, to schedule 3 concerning the withdrawal of an application for the service pension and to schedule 4 to correct drafting errors and unintentional consequences arising from the plain English rewrite of part 3 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.

         This bill also proposes to ensure that the disposition of assets up to five years prior to an application for a service pension will be taken into account when assessing the value of a person's assets for service pension purposes. In relation to managed investment, there is to be a provision to allow for the offsetting of losses against profits on capital invested and a more equitable calculation of the rate of return on certain investments. Currently, when a person in receipt of a service pension disposes of assets during a pension year, the amount disposed of is included in the value of the person's assets. Dispositions of assets are disregarded in the calculation when they occur over the five-year period.

         A recent case in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal found that the Department of Social Security had no authority to deal with the disposition for a period preceding a pension year if no pension was payable. The amendment applies the deprivation rules to persons lodging a claim for service pension if the disposition took place within the five years preceding the claim. As such, it aligns the rules for service pensioners with those applying to social security pensioners.

         The opposition will support most of the amendments as proposed, but we remain opposed to any amendments which affect the rules governing means testing and incomes for veterans and other pension recipients. This bill proves again that this government cannot help itself when it comes to changing the rules affecting the veteran community. During the committee stage, the coalition will be opposing sections of the bill which relate to changes to retirement incomes. We oppose these sections for one simple reason: an inquiry has been established by the government, thanks to pressure from the opposition, into retirement incomes and means testing. This review of retirement income streams and means testing of retirement incomes, which the opposition has said it would undertake when in government, is long overdue. The need for this review has become more apparent with the government's controversial treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares and investments.

At present we have a confused, cobbled-together and complex system which has evolved under this government. Veteran, service and social security age pensioners are actively discouraged from trying to provide for themselves, even partially, during their retirement years. It is difficult for people to prepare for their retirement when the rules are changing constantly. There is no consistent position from this government. One minister endorses one approach; another proposes that that approach be penalised.

         Many veterans have written to me, to many other members and senators and to the shadow minister for veterans' affairs (Senator MacGibbon) about the vexed question of the ever changing formula used to calculate the amount of income earned by veterans. Many letters show quite clearly that the amount people actually receive and the amount the Department of Veterans' Affairs assesses them as having received are quite different. In some cases that amount is quite small. In some cases, depending on the amount invested and the type of investment, it can be quite substantial. Ultimately, the point is that the pension is being reduced according to an amount of money which was not actually received by the pensioner.

         There is also the case of those people who invested certain capital during the last decade and saw the value of that investment decline dramatically because of the prevailing economic circumstances at the time. The value of those investments has been recovering of late, but in many cases that improvement does not exceed the purchase price of the original investment. The improved values are being monitored by the government and pensions are being quickly adjusted down.

         For many pensioners the value of their income units is still less than that which they originally paid for them. But, because of the listing of the units on the stock exchange and their recovery in price, pensioners are being assessed at a high rate despite the fact that the units still may not have recovered to their purchase price. The Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security make assessments which are reducing pensions to such a level that some pensioners are having to sell part of their investment in order to gain some real, as opposed to notional, income.

In fact, I probably have one of the older electorates, as far as age profile is concerned, of any member in this House—not the oldest but one of the older groups. Therefore, I am very much aware of the impact of our government's programs to assist the aged and the veterans in this country. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that in the 10 years of Labor government there have been many positive improvements to the welfare, income support and general community support that this government provides to the aged and veterans' community. It is also true to say that the veterans' community has supported the government in almost all of the actions it has taken in the care and provision of support and incomes for veterans and the aged because we have provided many very positive benefits to them throughout all our legislative packages.

Every time the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), used to introduce his bills in the caucus community services committee, no matter what was in the bill, he always said, `This is a good news bill', and we said, `Yes, Ben'. It was always his line that it was a good news bill regardless. But in this case this is a good news bill—and that is a correct description of this bill because all the measures contained in the bill are either bringing the treatment of veterans in line with the general Department of Social Security pensioners or are providing improved benefits for veterans. Therefore, there is much for this government to be proud of in what we have put together in this bill.

The bill covers the seniors health card; it fixes up some child related payments; it makes some adjustments with regard to retirement villages definitions; and a few other points. So it is basically a tidying up bill. It is a minor bill in the scheme of things. It introduces no additional or new policy with regard to treatment of veterans. It brings the veterans affairs legislation in line with that of the Department of Social Security.

Although the honourable member for Casey claimed all the credit on behalf of the opposition, I make the point that there were many honourable members on this side of the chamber who also called for that review.

         One of the things that constantly annoyed me about the contributions made in this debate, particularly from those opposite, in this cry about how the government is inhibiting or limiting the capacity of pensioners to provide for themselves—that, on the one hand, we as a government are saying that pensioners and veterans should save, contribute to a superannuation scheme or some other income scheme so they can raise their own assets and look after themselves in their retirement and that, on the other hand, we dare take that into account and reduce their pension because they have those assets.

         The very purpose of us asking people to have assets is so that, if they have assets that are earning, there is a reduced need for them to receive a pension from the government. That is the very purpose of our asking them to do it. When pensioners or veterans have certain assets that are earning money for them or the assets are increasing their capital value—therefore, having value that they can realise in the form of cash—the government will say, `Because of this extra income that you are earning as a result of those assets, you are now no longer requiring as much pension as you were getting'. That is the very purpose of it.

         There seems to be a misunderstanding that as people go through their retirement years, when they are in their 70s and 80s, they are not supposed to touch their assets, that their money is supposed to stay there forever as a nest egg for somebody else. As we may be asking some of those people to realise and utilise some of those assets for their own welfare, because they have sufficient assets, it is said that somehow the government is guilty of some massive crime. That is the very purpose of those assets. The reason those people worked hard to build up those assets and have those large superannuation payments, or whatever they might have in the form of assets for their retirement, is so that they can call on those assets when they need them. They are not there so that they can pass over a $200,000 asset to their children when they die. The money is supposed to be used for their own care.

         The government dared suggest that people should at some stage of their retirement realise, on a gradual basis, their shares, managed investments and other cash or capital assets to live on. People unfortunately complained because they wanted to pass some of those assets on to their children. But that is not the basis of government retirement incomes policy. The basis of government retirement incomes policy is that people should, where they have the capacity, raise their own assets and live off those assets. Where they do not have sufficient assets to live on, the government will support them through the provision of an age pension or a veterans' pension had they been service personnel.

The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) will have something to say about this in a moment in a little more detail. Government members reneged on a commitment to many in their electorates in this area and left it to those in the other place to argue an indefensible defence against what has now been agreed by the minister—that is, a genuine inquiry into all aspects of incomes and assets for social security pensioners and service pensioners, such as we are debating here this evening, and others.

        As the honourable member for Casey said, how can the government argue that it can go ahead unilaterally with the amendments it is suggesting in the context of this legislation without first waiting to find out what happens with the inquiry which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has established?

         I conclude my comments by reiterating what the honourable member for Casey said. We want action. We do not want any more fiddling around the edges, particularly on unrealised capital gains and everything that goes with it. Too many social security and service pensioners are hurting. Many of them are bleeding to death and many of them cannot afford to live under the conditions that have been imposed by this government in earlier legislation. As the honourable member for Casey and I have said, whilst we welcome most of the amendments, in the committee stage we cannot and will not support the amendment that affects incomes, unrealised capital gains and income distribution.

         —Like the other speakers in this debate, I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). When Australia calls on its men and women to serve their country in the military and peacekeeping forces, it is only proper that they are recognised not only for the efforts that they made on behalf of the nation but also at the time when they need support from their country. This bill covers that responsibility in a very comprehensive and caring way which should make all Australians proud, despite what members of the opposition have said so far tonight. It provides the necessary and deserved support to those veterans and their families.

         The bill introduces a number of changes to the veterans' affairs legislation, reflecting the government's ongoing social justice goals and implementing some of its election promises. It is interesting to note that the Keating Labor government in its 1993-94 budget continued the Labor Party's longstanding commitment to improving the range and quality of services available to the ex-service community and its dependants. It included progressive reforms for veterans that will affect almost every aspect of their lives, which I believe will be most welcome.

         The 1993-94 budget included reforms such as additional funding for hostel services, the seniors health card, health promotion, an improved veterans emergency telephone and counselling service, the establishment of the wound management foundation, new drugs being made available, the introduction of a health care provider quality management package, improvement in DVA health care administration, the extension of a Vietnam veterans counselling service, a veterans advice network, the training of ex-service community advocates, the veterans' children education scheme and the improved assessment of pensioners who are trust beneficiaries. That is rather an expansive and long list—something that goes a long way to honouring the social justice commitments of our government.

         The services that are provided to the ex-service community must continue to change because our ex-service community continues to change. This community of which I speak is, like all of us here, ageing. With that process comes different and varying needs which must constantly be re-evaluated and readjusted. It is not just a matter of having the same series of rules and regulations; they need to be constantly re-evaluated and readjusted.

         By the year 2000, the proportion of veterans who are 75 years of age and older will have doubled to 60 per cent. Our changing social environment means that elderly people might not have the close family support that was once the case. In light of these changing needs, this government is working to ensure that the full range of services and programs offered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs continues to meet the needs of the veteran community through the 1990s and into the 21st century, and that the money spent on these programs is being used in the most effective manner. This government has its priorities right. This government gave a commitment during the 1993 election campaign that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a seniors health card.

         The first major area of legislative change in this bill is the issue of a seniors health card as of 1 July 1994 to persons of service pension age but who are ineligible to receive a pension for access to concessional benefits in pharmaceutical, optometry and hearing services. Persons of service pension age whose income levels are the same as those of age pensioners may not be eligible for health related concessions because they are not entitled to receive a service or social security pension as a result of either failing certain eligibility or payability conditions such as the assets test or pension residential requirement, or their reluctance to claim a pension the value of which would be relatively insignificant.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second area of legislative change is the restructuring of child related payments to service pensioners to allow for more flexibility in the allocation of payments. The details of this include: providing a mechanism to allow child related payments to be redirected to the partner; allowing the adjustment of the child related payments in shared cases so that, in effect, those payments are also `shared'; providing that child related payments be paid in addition to the `frozen rate' of service pension paid to war widows or war widowers as the case may be; backdating child related payments to the first pay-day after the date of birth in those cases where notification is received within 13 weeks of the birth; and, finally, ensuring that, where pensioners have children and are receiving maintenance income, the maintenance income affects only the child related payments. These changes result in a more equitable method of assessing child related payments and flow from the family payments structure under the Social Security Act.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third area of legislative change involves a series of measures concerning the assessment of managed investments. All these changes are beneficial to service pensioners with managed investments. The first clarifies the legislation by ensuring that all losses can be offset against profits from other managed investments. The second ensures that, where an investment has been held for less than 12 months and only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. The third addresses certain friendly society investments. This measure would safeguard these investments by providing that where the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, the current assessment rules will apply.

         The bill also provides consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pensions for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. There are several other minor changes which involve the clarification of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. Another change simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension.

         These initiatives honour our election commitments and reflect our continued concern for the welfare of veterans and their families. I welcome the support by opposition members of these amendments and, believe it or not, I do understand their concerns regarding investment. Like them, I welcome the results of the inquiry into this complex affair. But the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) paint far too bleak a picture and, from my experience, highlight the concerns of only a very small and rather vocal minority in our community. I have much pleasure in commending this bill to the House.

         —The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) has encouraged me to make a considerable contribution to tonight's debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and I welcome the opportunity to do so. I want to address those matters that have been foreshadowed by my colleagues as matters that I might address, and I particularly want to take up those matters that are referred to as `minor' which relate to consequential changes arising from the earlier introduction of legislation that affected the Defence Services Homes Act of 1918. I wish to do so to simply make a number of points, fairly briefly, about the nature of the Defence Service Homes operation.

         I turn to what has been a matter of some disappointment for me. The Defence Service Homes operation, in its role as a provider of housing for our returned servicemen, undertakes to arrange insurance of properties in which it is the provider of funds by way of mortgage. Nothing unusual would seem to flow from that except that in relation to claims made under insurance we find that most insurance companies desirous of improving their image and conscious of the need to be able to satisfactorily resolve claims arising from damage to property have participated, at the government's request, I believe, in an organisation called the Insurance Industries Complaints Council. The chairman of that council is a very distinguished former member of this House, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. Under the auspices of that council, a number of panels have been established to enable a form of arbitration to occur if there are matters that can be resolved by panel arbitration without resort to expensive and difficult litigation.

         I turn to a matter about which I am not able to speak because certain steps were taken in that matter. I sought to get a reasonable discussion of outstanding disputes between the Department of Veterans' Affairs through its agent, Defence Service Homes, as an insurer and a constituent. I hasten to say that I was not the only person involved in this matter; a former minister was also involved. Without the organisation's voluntary accession to some other forms of discussion, there was no requirement that it submit to any of the forms of arbitration that all other insurance companies in this country have to.

         Somebody said to me that it was thought Defence Service Homes was a government body and when it insures one cannot expect it to participate in arrangements of this sort. In the report of the General Insurance Claims Review Panel, I went through a list of the participating insurers: 106 insurance companies participate in the claims review panel scheme as at 30 June 1993. That figure includes full membership of the Insurance Council of Australia and several non-members, who are asterisked.

         When I went through the list I found that a number of state government bodies involved in insurance—the State Government Insurance Corporation is one; others can be found upon going through the list, or by knowing them—are similarly members of this organisation, and that this organisation is now fulfilling a very valuable role in accepting complaints, particularly through the Consumer Affairs Bureau, and also through companies referring complaints themselves.

         When the complaints are analysed and the referrals are made, solicitors, amongst others, are involved in making submissions to this organisation. The panels are headed up by very distinguished Australians so, if it is a matter upon which an arbitrator is needed, people can go before panel one, which is headed by the Hon. Judith Cohen AO, or panel two, which is headed by Emeritus Professor Isaac. Both were former distinguished members of the arbitration commission in Australia.

         I hope, in the context of the operation of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the minister will take it upon himself to ensure a review of the Defence Service Homes operation is undertaken as quickly as possible to ensure that it will become a part of the group of good citizens who are prepared to submit complaints about their operations to arbitration by genuinely independent arbiters of the form that has been established under the auspices of the General Insurance Claims Review Panel. I hope that review will occur quickly, because I think if it does it may relieve Defence Service Homes of some of the hostility that I know exists amongst some members who have found that being insured with that corporation is not as advantageous as being insured by a general insurer.

         I want to take the opportunity in the time left to me to pick up the matters relating to the issue of managed investments. In relation to the provisions dealing with managed investments, there are winners and losers. Some beneficial aspects would occur for some ex-servicemen if amendments are made but others will suffer quite significantly as a result of the implementation of these provisions if they are to occur, in the same way that we saw very considerable hardship being imposed upon social security beneficiaries. The provisions before us are designed, so far as their management and treatment for the purposes of the asset and income test are concerned, to put managed investments on the same footing as the tests which now apply in the area of social security.

         These provisions which have operated in relation to social security have had a very significant and adverse impact  upon pensioner recipients. This impact has been increasing quite rapidly, as we have seen an increase in the value of listed shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. While listed shares may not be relevant to managed investments, managed investments are pooled funds—some of which can be invested in shares and some of which can be invested in other forms of investment. When we see an overall increase in the value of investments, particularly in relation to share portfolios as we have seen here, much the same sort of impact will occur in relation to managed investments as a result. These provisions are designed to bring the veterans affairs legislation into line with the Social Security Act.

         It has been made clear by the opposition in relation to other legislation that has sought to achieve this purpose, and it will also be argued in relation to social security legislation on each occasion that it is brought before the parliament, that in regard to any efforts on the government's part—whether it is argued that it is to bring provisions into line, that it is a technical amendment or that it is a modification necessary because of some intervention of some other tribunal—we will not support any further amendments of this legislation or the social security legislation dealing with managed investments, assets testing or income testing until the complete review of the assets and income test agreed to by the government has been implemented.

         I want to make very clear that the government set out a specific and precise program to be adhered to to obtain this review and report. A necessary part of it was to be the appointment of a consultant and the establishment of a reference panel once the terms of reference had been settled. We know that the terms of reference were settled upon last year. We have heard an announcement by the government of the people who will constitute the reference panel, but we have not heard any announcement by the government as to whom it will appoint to carry out this task.

In July the government expects to have a draft report prepared that could be made available for public comment in an expectation that, by September, it could report to the parliament. There is no sense of urgency on this matter so far as this government is concerned. Why is it that there is no sense of urgency?

The opposition thinks that the inquiry is long overdue. We think that it is an urgent inquiry and not something that can be delayed. We think that the government's timetable is already askew. We want to give the government a sense of urgency. As far as we are concerned, there will not be one amendment dealing with managed investments, or one amendment dealing with assets testing, or one amendment dealing with income testing, or one amendment dealing with unrealised capital gains, be it in this legislation or in the social security legislation, that will have our approval until this inquiry is fully undertaken.

I would be willing, for those who are interested, to pass on a list containing some of the constituents from their electorates who have been writing to me. I have been getting a mass of mail. I have circulated notes amongst my colleagues to find out the nature of the mail that they have been receiving. What I find is that many thousands of people have been affected by this legislation. They are angry about it and are making their feelings known. They believe the government has stalled for too long. In fact, the concern that is expressed to me is `What are you blokes in the opposition doing?'.

         —One of the reasons we are taking this step is to give the government the sense of purpose that it is so clearly lacking. At the appropriate time we will be moving for a committee debate to enable us to vote against the relevant provisions in this legislation. We will seek to do that again when the bill is before the Senate, assuming that this House behaves in the way that it usually does in relation to legislation of this sort.

I am sure that we would be happy to provide the honourable member for Groom and, for that matter, the honourable member for Berowra—who is earnest in his intentions in relation to these issues—with advice at an early date. It is good to see that those opposite have interests apart from what is going on in their own party room.

         —These are the provisions dealing with managed investments. I made the point in my speech that there are winners and losers in these provisions, which are designed to bring managed investment arrangements into line with those that operate in the social security area. These are matters that will be the subject of the general review into the way assets and income testing ought to be taken into account. Issues relating to managed investments are only one aspect of the whole issue of income and assets testing, but it is a matter of topical interest and real concern to a large number of veterans and social security beneficiaries affected by these provisions. Our view is that these provisions ought to await the general review. For this reason we believe that it is appropriate that they be opposed for the purpose of postponing implementation until we see what the inquiry has to say on this matter.

         —Tonight I would like  to address an issue which is having a distressing effect on a group of constituents—women who have recently become widows. A number of widows have contacted my office for help. Having looked further into their concerns, I am appalled by the way in which they have been treated. The government has abolished the widow/widower pension. A widow or widower now receives the widowed persons allowance for 13 weeks. After that time, he or she must apply for the jobsearch allowance and join the unemployment queues.

         If we examine the situation of these widows—typically, ex-housewives—we come to realise the sadness and inequity caused by the government's legislation. The women who have contacted me have been in their fifties; their children have grown, left home and have families of their own. Their late husbands of 20 or 30 years had been their main source of support and income. Now they discover that, after 13 weeks on the widowed persons allowance, they must go out and compete in the work force, very often for the first time in their lives. They do this with the knowledge that unemployment is critically high; that there are many school leavers out of work; and that people with excellent tertiary qualifications are also stranded in the job queue alongside them. They are obliged to attend the CES and scan the job boards alongside these younger people. One widow in particular told me of her humiliation when, having been forced to attend a training session at the local youth centre, she found herself in a room with a group of teenagers.

         The widows who have contacted me have been housewives for their entire working lives. They believe that they did the right thing by staying home to look after their family. Indeed, they were encouraged by the rest of society to believe that it was the best thing to do.

Child care is more widely available, though still not widely enough, and women are encouraged to compete for all kinds of jobs.

         However, that was not always the case for these widows when they were younger. As one widow pointed out, she was told to believe that she was doing the right thing when she stayed at home to look after her family. While I understand the need to encourage widows to support themselves and become independent of the government, I do not condone the way in which the government has set about it.

         It is true that the Department of Social Security offers a counselling service for widows. However, I believe that this does little more than talk the widows into accepting the humiliation. In addition, when the widows move from the widowed persons allowance to the jobsearch allowance their payment decreases from $316 to $286 per fortnight. Widows also receive fewer concessions under the jobsearch allowance than they do under the widowed persons allowance.

         Under the widowed persons allowance, a person is entitled to concessions on pharmaceuticals, dental services, redirection of mail and transport on Australian national rail, a telephone allowance and in some states a reduction in council rates. Under the jobsearch allowance, a widow is entitled only to some health and public transport concessions. Surely there is something more we can do.

         If we are honest with ourselves, we will admit that many of these widows have a slim chance of finding employment. The lack of jobs, their age and their lack of formal qualifications will go against them. A young lady recently raised an innovative suggestion with me. She said, `Why don't we ask these women to look after our children while the young women go out to work? I would love to have one of them look after my children. They have so many skills, they should not be wasted'.

         I call on the government to assess the impact this legislation is having on these women in human terms and to change the legislation for women who have reached a certain age. For example, people aged over 50 who have received the jobsearch allowance for longer than 12 months could report less often to the Department of Social Security. Perhaps widows could qualify immediately for this type of limited reporting. Some concessions need to be made. We need more creative, compassionate legislation.

He has spent millions doing up his own offices for ministers overseas. I will bring to this House evidence of the penthouse being built in London for some mate of Jeffrey Kennett who has a job over there. It is a scandal. I am quite certain everyone is aware of what exactly is happening in Victoria as the government goes about destroying the infrastructure that was set up to support those in need and those on low incomes.

         —I rise to say a few words this evening once again on the proposed post office closures in our nation. With post offices throughout Australia the belief is, and from the many media reports it is not an unreasonable belief, that 5,000 or 6,000 employees of the postal service in Queensland will lose their jobs. There is a job to be done out there and, if there is not, quite obviously these people should lose their jobs. But the restructuring that is taking place and the proposals that are coming forward will result not only in many employees losing their jobs, but also in those post office licensees—who paid a lot of money in many cases to purchase the post offices and the assets that go with them—finding that they will no longer be able to make a profit from the asset they paid a lot of money to purchase.

I once again pay tribute to the committee that exists at present for fighting not only for itself, but also for the client group that it serves throughout the isolated and rural areas of Queensland and also many of the urban areas of Queensland where similar services will be curtailed.

         This is taking place against a background where, from memory, almost every single month for the last five months the unemployment figure in Australia has been over 980,000, which is the highest figure in the nation's history. That figure has continued to rise over successive monthly periods. All I can say to those people who say that there has been a small alleviation of unemployment in the last month is that that is like saying that the giant slippery slide is going upwards because, if one looks at the welding joint, one sees that there is a little bump that is going upwards.

         We have heard again and again in this House—and when I was not in this House I read about it in the media coming from this House—that unemployment had turned the corner. It does not matter how many times that phrase is said, if it is said in this place with enough confidence and conviction, and is taken up by the yes men in the press gallery, then it is amazing how many people throughout Australia are inclined to believe this rubbish.

         Not only is the unemployment figure hovering around 11 per cent—the highest in the nation's history, with the arguable exception of the five or six years of the Great Depression—but also there has been an increase of some 250,000 to 300,000 people in tertiary education in that period. They are relative figures, not absolute figures. So we are saying that if one wants an accurate picture of the unemployment level, then one must add the artificial jobs that have been created in tertiary employment. I say artificial jobs because there are 30,000 people in Australia now who have a university degree and who are working in labouring jobs or who are not working at all. So it is hardly filling the people who are aspiring to go to tertiary education institutions with hope to be told that 30,000 people with university educations have no jobs at all.

         Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, regulations can explicitly exempt the carriers—Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone—from any state or territory law. In these cases, the telecommunications national code may cover exempt matters and govern the carriers in these matters. Both regulations and the code are disallowable instruments.

         The telecommunications exempt activity regulations give the carriers immunity from state laws involving environmental impact assessment; heritage protection; town planning; land use; powers and functions of local governments; and the supply of fuel and power. Activities which are exempt from the laws also include the installation of exchanges, earth stations, power lines, antennae, lines, towers and masts; and the construction of payphone boxes, pits, trenches and tunnels. That means that Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone can put those sorts of things anywhere they like.

         As a Commonwealth instrumentality, Telecom has never been subject to state or territory environmental legislation. When the Telecommunications Act 1991 was introduced, a decision was made to exempt the new carriers from state and territory environmental legislation in order to put them on an even footing with Telecom. A later amendment extended this provision to the third mobile carrier, Vodaphone. The only environmental constraints that the new carriers, Optus and Vodaphone, are presently required to meet are those in the draft telecommunications code. Section 11 of the code provides that carriers consult with the Australian Heritage Commission on relevant issues, but that they do not have to act on its advice.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Australian Heritage Commission Act still applies to Telecom as a federal instrumentality. As a result, Optus and Vodaphone are in the unique position of being able to ignore both state and federal heritage provisions. On environmental matters, the critical section of the code is section 9. This section gives the carriers the right to decide whether or not an exempt activity is environmentally significant. If the carrier can proceed with the project, this has the effect of making all other substantial provisions of the code dependent on the carrier's own opinion. Honourable members can imagine what that is. The state and territory authorities have no power of veto, and there is no provision for a public consultation process under the draft code. The then Department of Transport and Communications argued for this exclusion from public scrutiny. One wonders why.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In summary, the draft code gives Optus and Vodaphone complete discretion as to whether a project is environmentally significant and whether to perform an impact assessment. It is then up to Optus or Vodaphone to decide whether to reject the comments made by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, or anyone else, on the environmental impact of the project. Once an assessment process has been initiated, the department can delay the project but cannot halt or modify it.

         In practice, it appears that Optus and Vodaphone are not ignoring DEST, but this is not to say that they will not in the future. The provisions given to these companies can certainly undermine the proper environmental regulations. The final code is now with the legal section of the Department of Communications and the Arts. It will then go to the Attorney-General's Department for redrafting. Once it is approved by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), he will sign and table the code. The contents of this final code are not yet known.

         So, at the moment, these companies can build these towers anywhere they like, and we cannot do anything about it. I call on the minister to act immediately in relation to this issue, to get this draft code up and going, and to make certain that these towers are not being spread all over the place and ruining our environment by the ugliness—the blight—that they put on our cities and our mountains.

         I wish to talk this evening about unemployment because that is the scourge of the 1990s. It certainly affects a considerable number of my constituents. In fact, it directly affects almost a million Australians, and indirectly affects their spouses, partners and dependent children. However, bald statistics—I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) is leaving—do not tell the full story of the problem. Taking under-employment and hidden unemployment into account, about one in five Australians in the labour force is not able to use his or her skills and experience to maximum advantage.

         Labor has lost the plot on unemployment. The government throws up its hands in horror but has done nothing to actively tackle the problem, only study it further. The latest initiative is a discussion or green paper on unemployment released in December for comment, with a government white paper on unemployment expected at budget time in May. This white paper will come more than three years after the start of the recession—after three budgets, One Nation and a series of failed economic statements. By then unemployment may have topped 10 per cent for 32 months consecutively. Meanwhile, one-third of a million Australians will have been unemployed for over 12 months and their families trapped without real hope from Labor. One in 10 of Australia's children and dependent students are growing up in families directly scarred by unemployment.

         When all is said and done, it comes down to strong economic growth and private sector investment in new and existing businesses to create enough jobs to reduce unemployment from today's tragically high figures. The coalition is about fostering the necessary conditions for growth and investment. It is particularly concerned about the areas of genuine industrial relations and workplace reform—not the window-front industrial reform being proposed by the government. It is about encouraging business investment, providing a positive and certain environment in which business can operate, and implementing a wide ranging program of reform, including reductions in taxation and imposts on business.

         —The parliamentary secretary at the table laughs. The cold facts of unemployment are that in December 1993 the national unemployment rate was 10.7 per cent, seasonally adjusted. This represents 937,000 Australians looking for work. That is a national tragedy. I say to the parliamentary secretary at the table that it is no laughing matter. Over 10 per cent of the labour force has been unemployed in every month since August 1991. Unlike in previous recessions, more Australians are staying unemployed for longer. In late 1993 the number of long-term unemployed, those who had been out of a job for a year or more, was around 350,000 and getting larger. ABS statistics indicate that long-term unemployed men outnumber long-term unemployed women by about two to one.

        The guidelines state that it would be expected that ships issued with voyage permits meet the standards of safety and working conditions of international conventions to which Australia is a party. The guidelines specify that any ship issued with a continuing voyage permit will be inspected by a marine surveyor (Australian Maritime Safety Authority) on arrival at its first Australian port of call. The guidelines do not specify a comparable requirement for a ship issued with a single voyage permit. Ships operating under single voyage permits are subject to Port State Control inspections on the same basis as other foreign ships visiting Australian ports. This has generally proved successful in detecting errant ships and acting as a deterrent for sub-standard ships intending to visit Australian ports.

        At the time of the 1992-93 budget, the Government reviewed the progress of commercialisation of DAS services and recognised that staff reductions would be required if these DAS businesses were to be viable in the long term. It was decided that those staff who are surplus to the fee earning capacity of DAS business units should cease to be the managerial responsibility of those units.

        Arrangements, emphasising voluntary redundancy and redeployment, were established to manage the staff who were identified as surplus. Those arrangements provide for surplus staff to be transferred from their business unit to the DAS Staffing Adjustment Program where they receive training and other assistance and undertake work in the public interest pending redeployment. This approach obviated the need to invoke the involuntary redundancy provisions of the Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987. Also, many worthwhile projects have benefited, for example, the Multi Function Polis.

        At the same time, every effort has been made to ensure that the processes for identifying and redeploying surplus staff are consistent and equitable. DAS undertook extensive negotiations with the relevant unions and agreed arrangements contained in the Memorandum of Understanding on the Management of Surplus Staff in the Department of Administrative Services (MOU) which was concluded in January 1993. The MOU processes continue to be used by Australian Construction Services (ACS) and other DAS businesses.

        In the 1993-94 budget, the Government announced its intention to review the MOU arrangements early next year, after they have been in place for 12 months. The review will have regard to a number of factors including DAS's achievement in redeploying staff, progress in restructuring, and the possible need for stronger measures to improve the prospects of surplus officers securing new jobs.

        ACS has been reducing its staffing numbers and profile since 1989. These changes reflect the demands placed on the business by a reduction in the size of its traditional market and a need for greater flexibility in its staff composition to meet its clients' varied needs.

        This restructure will put ACS on a more competitive footing by providing a more flexible workforce with a core of 600 staff. All of these adjustments, as difficult as they can be, are being made with the intention of securing ACS's long term future.

        The guidelines state that it would be expected that ships issued with voyage permits meet the standards of safety and working conditions of international conventions to which Australia is a party. The guidelines specify that any ship issued with a continuing voyage permit will be inspected by a marine surveyor of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) on arrival at its first Australian port of call. The guidelines do not specify a comparable requirement for a ship issued with a single voyage permit. Ships operating under single voyage permits are subject to Port State Control inspections on the same basis as other foreign ships visiting Australian ports. This has generally proved successful in detecting errant ships and acting as a deterrent for sub-standard ships intending to visit Australian ports.

        The purpose-built Strehlow Research Centre (SRC) was officially opened in Alice Springs on 26 June 1991. The SRC now houses all the material from the Strehlow Collection which was in the possession of the Northern Territory Government at the time of my previous answer in March 1991. I have been advised by the SRC Board that no objects have been returned to traditional owners but that an extensive research project has been commenced to identify the current traditional owners of the sacred objects in their collection.

        In March 1992 it became public that Mr Carl Strehlow, the son of the late Professor Ted Strehlow, intended, through his agent, Mr Jeffrey Fischer, to auction approximately 265 Aboriginal artefacts which had been collected by his father. In accordance with the SA Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988 he requested the approval of the State Minister prior to sale. In April the State Minister ordered the surrender of 213 of the objects and in May seized a further 9 objects and related records from Dr Kathleen Strehlow's residence.

        During this period various interested groups, including the Central Land Council (CLC), the SRC and the South Australian Museum were given access to the objects. Ultimately, the SA Government decided not to compulsorily acquire the objects and indicated to me that it intended to return the objects to the Strehlows on 28 July 1992. However, the Northern Territory Government obtained an injunction in the NT Supreme Court preventing the SA Government from returning the objects to the Strehlows.

        Discussions between the Northern Territory Government and the Strehlows about the ownership of the objects continued until September 1993 when the Northern Territory Government indicated that it intended to withdraw its legal action. On 22 September 1993 the CLC made an application under s.12 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (the Heritage Protection Act) for a declaration to prevent the return of 171 of the objects to the Strehlows. I made the declaration on 24 September and it came into effect on publication in the
