                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm moving this motion to suspend standing orders because we cannot wait another day and watch the level of antisemitism continue to build on our campuses unanswered. We need to put an inquiry in place before second semester begins at the end of July. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There should be nothing surprising to anyone about this bill. I've been talking about a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus since November last year. On 3 May, I announced I'd be preparing this bill. I released terms of reference three weeks later. On 16 May, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Henderson, along with several non-Greens crossbenchers in the House and the other place wrote to the Prime Minister calling on the government to establish a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus. Other crossbenchers also wrote separately to the Prime Minister asking that a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus be established. On Monday 3 June, I introduced the private member's bill for a judicial inquiry that I now seek leave to have debated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Antisemitism on campus is not new. The problem of campus antisemitism before 7 October was identified by the Australian Jewish student survey. It included that 64 per cent of Australian Jewish university students experienced antisemitism on campus and 19 per cent stayed away because of antisemitism. The massive increase in campus antisemitism since 7 October has included Jewish students being spat at and taunted with swastikas; the office of Jewish staff members being urinated on; academics saying that Jews don't deserve cultural safety; academics denying that the rapes on 7 October even occurred; the failure of university leaders to deal properly with antisemitism, including dealing with encampments; vice-chancellors implying that hate-fuelled protests are just the price that Jewish students have to pay for free speech; and a collective statement from 39 university chancellors which was so weak it didn't even mention the words 'Jew' or 'antisemitism'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this motion is successful, we will debate a bill which provides for the establishment of a commission of inquiry with royal commission powers, led by a current or former judge, to inquire into antisemitism on university campuses. This inquiry would examine incidents of antisemitic activity both before and after 7 October. It will consider whether the response of university leaders, regulators, representative organisations and others have been adequate. Jewish communal organisations support this bill for a judicial inquiry, and they reject the general antiracism inquiry by the Human Rights Commission. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, which is the federal representative body of the Jewish community in Australia, has said they wholeheartedly endorse my bill. They have said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A judicial inquiry, as originally called for in May by Mr Leeser, would allow Jewish students and staff to give evidence in a closed hearing, without having to fear reprisals from the fanatical fringe of anti-Israel or Jew-hating students, or victimisation from anti-Israel and antisemitic faculty members. There would be no opportunity for political grandstanding by any party, and the sole focus would be on getting to the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government's plan is not to have a standalone judicial inquiry to deal with antisemitism on campus but to have a general antiracism inquiry running for two years, dealing with racism against First Nations people, antisemitism and Islamophobia. Can I say, as a Jewish Australian, I am so sick and tired of this government, the Human Rights Commission, universities and other bodies in Australia being unable to say antisemitism without saying Islamophobia in the same breath. To fail to singularly identify and call out the particularity of antisemitism and, indeed, the largest increase in antisemitism in our history in and of itself is antisemitic. It creates a dangerous narrative for our social harmony that suggests a Jewish-Muslim conflict here in Australia, when so much of the antisemitism is actually propagated by the militant socialist left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Islamophobia is a bad thing, and it should be called out. It must be called out and properly dealt with. After the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001, there was heightened Islamophobia in this country. No-one was saying at that time that we couldn't mention Islamophobia without mentioning antisemitism in the same breath. The level and scale of antisemitism at the moment is unprecedented in the history of this country—a country which has had Jews here since the First Fleet and which uniquely in this world has been one of the few countries where there has been no formal discrimination against Jews. But we have to tell the truth. There's only one community which has been subjected to those vile Opera House protests, where radicals and jihadists sought to do harm to that community, and that's the Jewish community. There is only one community that has had its artists and creatives doxxed, and that's the Jewish community. There is only one community subjected to the hate filled drive-throughs in its suburbs, and that's the Jewish community. There is only one community on campus that's having its students spat at and taunted and its staff offices urinated on with the vice-chancellor standing by, saying, 'That's just the price you have to pay for free speech,' and that's the Jewish community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jewish Australians are so sick and tired of the moral equivalence, particularly because so many Jewish Australians are always at the forefront, pushing back against bigotry against other groups. Yet, at our time of need, we feel abandoned. Martin Luther King said, 'In the end we remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.' You can't blame the Jewish community for having no confidence in the Human Rights Commission, given the commission's record. Remember, the commission was the body designed to prevent racism and stand for social harmony, but for more than six months they have said nothing about the largest increase in antisemitism in the history of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Senate estimates, the president of the commission repeatedly refused to call out antisemitism and condemn Hamas. The new Race Discrimination Commissioner, the person who would be running the government's inquiry, could not condemn the phrase 'from the river to the sea'—a phrase rightly condemned by the Prime Minister and rightly condemned in a bipartisan motion in the other place. The Race Discrimination Commissioner said that he'd have to see the context. There is systemic racism against Jews at the commission as evidenced by the statements and action of their staff and contractors. This includes the head of Hugh consulting, who was engaged to prepare antiracism material but was involved in the doxxing of 600 Jewish creatives and publicly urged her followers to, 'let these effing Zionists know no effing peace.' The commission's lawyer publicly stated that Jewish people are not entitled to cultural safety and suggested the 7 October terrorist attacks could make sense. Referring to Jewish people, another staff member wrote, 'What are they without Zionism? If we take that away—their violence, their toxicity, their racism—what's left of them as a people?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was the call by commission staff in relation to the terrorist attacks 'to acknowledge Israel's occupation of Palestine as the source of the violence and embed an acknowledgement of Israel's apartheid, occupation and genocide in all communications regarding this matter' from the commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why Peter Wertheim from the ECAJ has said, 'Sadly, the Jewish community cannot have confidence in an inquiry to be conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission.' He continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The AHRC's record of public statements and action in the face of the unprecedented surge of antisemitism that has occurred in Australia, especially since 7 October 2023, has been conspicuously deficient. The recent record of some of the people associated with the Commission has also featured a shocking level of bias. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Prime Minister had fine words to say about the need to deal with antisemitism—words that I hope every member of this House could support. He said, 'There is no place for antisemitism in our communities, at our universities or outside electorate offices. No-one should be targeted for who they are. The targeting of people because they are Jewish is completely unacceptable.' Today, this is the opportunity for all members to give effect to his words by supporting this urgency motion and supporting passage of this bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At their best, universities are life-changing places where people get an education and improve their opportunities in life. It's where the next generation of leaders is formed. That's why it's so important antisemitism doesn't take hold. It's why it's so important students are taught about the evils of antisemitism, that it's important to always reject antisemitism however it manifests and that it's not okay to be a bystander. If we're not teaching this to the next generation, then we're setting ourselves up for a society based on conspiracy, not fact, on 'othering', not personal responsibility, and on social discord, not social harmony. What happens on campus today sets the tone for the Australia of tomorrow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly said, this is a time for moral courage and moral clarity. We cannot have a situation in this country where Jewish staff and students are being given a message on campus that says, 'You are not welcome here.' It is time that this parliament said, 'Enough.' It is time to support this motion and bring this bill on for debate, and establish a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus, to deal properly with a problem that was festering since before 7 October and has got manifestly worse since that time. I commend this motion to all members of the House. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:12</span>):  I'm pleased to second this motion by the member for Berowra calling for a judicial inquiry into antisemitism on campus or, to be specific, calling for this House to immediately debate the bill that the member for Berowra has introduced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the member for Berowra on introducing the Commission of Inquiry into Antisemitism at Australian Universities Bill 2024. He, of course, is a proud Jewish Australian. He is also a proud Australian committed to mutual understanding, tolerance, respect and the effective functioning of our liberal multiparty democracy as a nation in which all Australians, regardless of race, creed or background, can feel safe. As he has eloquently pointed out, the reason the issue is urgent is the sad fact that today Jewish Australians do not feel safe on campus or in other aspects of our national life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an urgent issue for this House to deal with, because the lessons of history are very clear. If antisemitism is allowed to fester unchecked, it can lead to very, very damaging and dangerous consequences. That is particularly so when such antisemitism is being encouraged and fostered by the cynical political manoeuvring of the Greens political party. This issue is urgent. It is hard to imagine an issue which better meets the criteria for standing orders to be suspended. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, secondly, say that the government has proposed a method to deal with the issue of antisemitism on campus and that method is too weak, inappropriate and unworkable. It is the proposed method to have the Australian Human Rights Commission hold an inquiry into all forms of racism on campus—an inquiry that would run for two years and be carried out by an organisation which manifestly, and for very good reason, the Australian Jewish community does not trust. We have seen from the Human Rights Commission a lack of willingness to deal with the challenge of antisemitism in Australia, despite a 738 per cent increase in antisemitic incidents since 7 October. For more than six months the Human Rights Commission has said nothing to publicly, singularly and specifically condemn antisemitism in Australia, and, sadly, as the member for Berowra has eloquently demonstrated to this House, there is clear evidence of systematic hostility towards Jewish Australians by staff and contractors of the Human Rights Commission. In these circumstances, you could not think of a less credible and appropriate body to be investigating what is an extraordinarily serious issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for that reason that the member for Berowra, the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, have sought to provide leadership on this issue when leadership has been lacking from the government. That is why we have proposed—and specifically the member for Berowra has proposed—a judicial inquiry. The functions of it would be equivalent to a royal commission. It would be led by an independent current or former judge. It would have full investigatory powers. It would be assisted by skilled cross-examiners. It could hear evidence in confidentiality, without witnesses being in fear of reprisal. It is a sad reality that, given the nature of this issue and some of the cynical political manoeuvrings fostered by the Greens political party, it is understandable that some who might be called as witnesses might fear for their personal safety, so the measures and powers of such a judicial inquiry would be extraordinarily important in these circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this bill was introduced by the member for Berowra we have seen from the government silence and equivocation. That equivocation must end. This parliament must act on this important issue, and the first thing we must do is debate and vote on this bill immediately. I'm proud to second this motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:17</span>):  I want to pay tribute to the fine words of the member from Berowra and the way in which he has stood up so strongly, and with real anger, frustration and heartbreak at the appalling rise in antisemitism that we have seen since 7 October. With the exception of the closing remarks of the Manager of Opposition Business, I want to pay credit to his remarks as well. I do take very serious issue with the statement he made—I think these were his words—that all they have seen from the government is 'silence and equivocation'. I don't know whether he wrote those words yesterday morning, rather than this morning, but I don't think it does proper credit to the very significant moment we saw in this parliament yesterday in question time—a very significant moment of agreement and forthright statement by the Prime Minister of this country and the alternative prime minister of the country about the hatred, disinformation, misinformation and toxic division being sown out in the community, including by some members of this parliament. I don't think it does credit, frankly, to the very significant moment we saw in question time yesterday to allege, and to accuse the government of, silence and equivocation in the face of what the member for Berowra rightly says is an appalling rise in antisemitism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My mother's forebears Sarah and Abraham came to this country because they knew that this was as safe a place as you could find on the planet, for all races, including Jews. It's why Australia had the largest per capita intake of Holocaust survivors after World War II—because this was seen as a safe haven. It breaks people's hearts—particularly Jewish Australians' hearts. It breaks all reasonable-thinking Australians' hearts to see the appalling hatred and some of the slogans, which I won't repeat, that are used blithely now and that openly contemplate the destruction of the State of Israel. It breaks people's hearts, and I completely understand and echo the anger and frustration that we heard in the member for Berowra's fine contribution to the parliament this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe if the members of the opposition had consulted with us about the idea of bringing a bill on and dealing with it in an hour—the opposition knows this is not the way we are going to deal with it. There's no way any government is going to agree to a motion that seeks to bring on legislation and deal with it in a hour with absolutely no notice given to the government or to the relevant ministers. While I accept the heartfelt comments of the member for Berowra and the Manager of Opposition Business, who I know feels deeply about this issue as well, they both know that this is not a motion the government could ever support. The idea of bringing on a bill and dealing with it in one hour with no notice is simply not a motion the government could support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The members and other members of the opposition are quite aware of what the Minister for Education has done in response to some of the appalling hatred we are seeing on our university campuses. The opposition might not agree with some of those processes, but they are aware of them. So, while I wholeheartedly endorse many of the sentiments the member for Berowra, in particular, expressed in his heartfelt speech—I feel them deeply as well, as do so many others on this side of the House and on the crossbench—we will not be supporting this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:21</span>):  This is, in colloquial terms, a no-brainer. For us, the Leader of the House has just talked about being taken by surprise and about all these wonderful things that were talked about yesterday. Yesterday was a good moment on this issue, but it was eight months too late. For the last eight months since 7 October, Australians have been clamouring for political leadership. We all saw what happened on 9 October, where we had that appalling, atrocious display of antisemitism on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. What this country needed on that night—at least at a federal level—was the political leadership that was shown yesterday. But 27 million Australians were left looking for that political leadership because it did not come from this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk is cheap. It's very easy to stand up and say nice words. But the Jewish community is looking for real, genuine political leadership. What we saw yesterday was a rightful coming together of the parties of government in this place in its condemnation of the Greens. It was rightful, but once again it was too late. The Greens have been doing nothing other than causing division in this community, in our national community. They have stoked division on our university campuses. That's what this bill is all about—this bill moved by my friend the member for Berowra. Not one person could question the integrity of this man, who has stood by and had the courage of his convictions to point out the absolutely failing and disgraceful lack of leadership from our university sector and from our leaders of our universities—the vice-chancellors that are paid a king's ransom to oversee the administration of their universities. All they have done is sew discord by their failure to act, their failure to lead and their failure to show moral courage. Each and every single one of those vice-chancellors who have failed to step up and provide genuine moral courage stands condemned in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a judicial inquiry in relation to not just the conduct of the vice-chancellors and not just how the Greens have conducted themselves on campuses but how students and, particularly, academics have conducted themselves and the appalling way in which Jewish students and academics have been treated. To suggest, as the government does, that this job could be done by the Human Rights Commission is an absolute disgrace. The Human Rights Commission has utterly failed the Jewish community in this country time and time and time again, and yet these geniuses over here want to put Dracula in charge of the blood bank. It is an absolute joke. I commend the member for Berowra, and I commend this motion.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will mean that the cost of PBS medicines will stay lower for longer, instead of rising with inflation. This will help Australians with cost-of-living pressures, and help people to keep taking their necessary medicines. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cash flow and payment times are absolutely critical for small businesses. It's simply unfair for big business to delay payments. Late payments are a major stress, and it's incredibly wasteful of the time of small-business owners and operators for them to have to spend time chasing and chasing the accounts departments of big businesses that just don't seem to care. Small business is critical to the Australian economy—more than $500 billion of economic value. More than 2.5 million individual small businesses are creating more than five million jobs and employing more than five million Australians in those jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say, at the outset, something about one of the silliest things that we hear from those opposite. It is a very long list; I wouldn't say this is at the top. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy, who's at the table, would probably beg to differ. He'd talk about nuclear power and so on. That is pretty silly. But one of the silliest things we hear consistently is their schtick, their claim, their brand propaganda that somehow the Liberals are the party of small business. It's just nonsense. I say unequivocally, if you actually look at the record—not announcements, not the spin, but actually what the Labor Party has done in government and the difference between the last government and this government—Labor is the party of small business. Those opposite run this line that no-one over here on this side has ever worked in a small business and that no-one over here has ever run a small business. That's also simply not true. It doesn't matter; they just keep saying it because it is part of their brand propaganda and shtick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I worked in a small business. It was my university job. It was tough. My mum actually chose not to go back to nursing. She tried, but, when my dad died, she just couldn't make the shiftwork balance with caring for my brother and I. So she worked for some decades in a small business doing accounts, stock control and sales. I ended up doing that as my university job and saw firsthand the stress of the cashflow impacts, the way that you have to balance payments and the impact when suppliers are simply not paying you on time. Many government members—the employment minister, for instance—have operated their own small businesses, and many of our current ministers have husbands, wives or partners who operate small businesses—the Minister for Small Business, for instance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be very clear, when you strip it back, the core purpose of the Liberal Party has never changed. It's to protect those who already have the most accumulated wealth. That's the thing that sets them completely off. The other thing that sets them off, of course, is changes that are fair to workers. That's another speech.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll stand on the government's record. This bill exemplifies that. The context is important. The budget, which complements that, will ease the pressure on 2.5 million Australian small businesses, providing more than $640 million in practical and targeted support. The payment time changes are important, but so is the government's initiative to invest $290 million, extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off, making it easier for small business to invest and grow. They like to claim that on the opposition side as one of their policies. They conveniently forget that it was the Rudd and Gillard government who put that measure in. Then the Liberals got elected and Tony Abbott scrapped it, until we embarrassed them into putting it back. But they like to pretend it was theirs.</span>

                    </a>  I think the point of order proved my point: they don't actually like it when you talk about their practical record on small business and why bills like this are necessary. We could all argue the point about the second reading amendment, which no doubt, as sure as night follows day, is pretty broad and would cover pretty much whatever you wanted to say. But I'll keep on.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill overhauls the Payment Times Reporting Act. It levels the playing field so large businesses have to treat small businesses fairly. It will increase the pressure on big business to pay on time, including name-and-shame provisions for slow-paying big businesses. You don't want to have to use them. The point is to create incentives, through the system, for big business to do the right thing and pay on time. To be fair, many big businesses do pay on time. They get this; they get that their SMEs, their suppliers, are important and that keeping them viable, keeping them afloat by doing the right thing and paying on time, does matter. The bill will also do this but in a way which reduces red tape, streamlines reporting pressures and removes inefficiencies in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Payment Times Reporting Regulator is getting $33 million, as a complementary budget measure, to improve its ICT infrastructure. It's part of modern government, really. You can't just design measures like this without the policy going hand in glove with ICT improvements. As we saw repeatedly under the former government—was it $92 million they wasted on the failed visa privatisation through Liberal mate Scott Briggs, and, before that, their first crack at it, another $80 million or thereabouts on a failed ICT project?—it's important, like this measure shows, to get the ICT lined up with the policy changes. The reforms impact the same large business cohort—large businesses with over $100 million—required to report previously but do it in a way, as I said, that cuts red tape and makes it easier for big businesses to comply with their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a legitimate question raised as to why the minister needs a power to give direction to slow payers of small businesses. Quite simply, the power will shine a light on large businesses that are persistently slow in paying their small-business suppliers. It creates the incentive, as I said, for large businesses to treat small businesses more fairly. Such a direction can also draw attention to the practices of slow-paying large businesses much earlier and with more prominence than just the reporting regime: 'If a large business pays slow, people will know.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll leave my remarks there. I'm sorry to have upset the shadow minister in stating a few facts, but it is a fact that when the Liberals were last elected to government they cancelled the instant asset write-off test. I know it upsets them when you say it. They'll find another point of order. I don't want to upset you. I mean, you can get your steps up. You can jump up and down and take little points of order to stop the truth coming out, Shadow Minister, but it is a fact. Labor are proud of our record on small business. I'm proud of our budget initiatives and I'm proud of the fact that we've found a way, with this legislation and the complementary ICT investments, to get big businesses paying small businesses more quickly, making a real difference to cash flow and such.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To anybody who is listening to these proceedings, in particular, on any building sites around the country: I'd like you to listen up. I'm a carpenter and joiner by trade. I then went back to school and did a law degree as a mature-age student. I was involved in small business for 35 years before I came into this place. What any small-business person knows is that cash flow is the lifeblood of any business. You can be the best carpenter, plumber or electrician—the best tradesperson—in the world, but if you don't have cash flow your business's days are numbered. Cash flow is king.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen for many years in this country, particularly in the construction sector, is a reluctance to pay on time. Subcontractors, particularly those in the construction sector, are often referred to as 'a builder's bank'. Those days must be numbered. We cannot allow or see a continuous situation where those down the contractual chain, those who are smallest in their business size, are effectively held to ransom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every state and territory in this country, particularly in the construction sector, has security-of-payment legislation. There are eight separate pieces of legislation which deal with security of payment in this country. There are not nine. There are six states, two territories and one Commonwealth. The one that's missing is the Commonwealth. There is no Commonwealth legislation which deals with security of payment. Security of payment is tied to payment times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend a scheme that was put in place by the former government back in 2021. This bill largely improves upon the original scheme that we introduced and put in place when we were in government. The original scheme provided for large companies to be held to account if they paid those down the contractual chain in a slow fashion. It's a name-and-shame type of approach, and that's a good thing. I think this bill can be improved in a number of respects, and I'll come to that, but I think it's really worthwhile to point out why this bill is needed to the extent that it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These figures are taken from ASIC. Company insolvencies in Australia for the financial year of 2022 were just a tick under 5,000. The figure was 4,912. In financial year 2023 they jumped to 7,942. That figure for corporate insolvencies went up by 3,000. In financial year 2024—and we ain't finished yet; we've still got the May and June reporting periods to go, so we're two months short—we've had 8,743 corporate insolvencies. We are seeing the greatest number of corporate insolvencies in many, many years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask yourself why this is the case. It is because of the cost-of-living crisis that this government is responsible for. We've now had five quarters of the most challenging economic circumstances since 1991. The growth for the last quarter was 0.1 per cent. It doesn't get much closer to zero growth than 0.1 per cent. Every day, when we come into this place, we hear the Treasurer crowing about how this government has been so good economically, but there are thousands and thousands of businesses out there in the real world that are doing it incredibly tough, not least of which are those in the construction sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing higher rates of construction company failures than ever before. The construction industry received the highest number of reports of insolvency, at 28 per cent, followed by the accommodation and food services industry, at 15 per cent, according to the Australian Institute of Company Directors. According to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the most commonly reported causes of business failure were inadequate cash flow and high cash use. The member for Longman was a very successful businessman before he came to this place. He knows the importance of cash flow. He knows, as does the vast bulk of members on this side of the House who come from a small-business background, that cash flow is king.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The operation of this act is very important to recognise. The bill seeks to achieve seven outcomes. The first is to create a mechanism to permit the Minister for Small Business to direct an entity found to be in the slowest 20 per cent of payers overall or by industry to make enhanced disclosures to the regulator. The second is to permit the minister to direct a slow-paying entity to state in public-facing materials that it is a slow small-business payer. That's a good thing. If I am a small business and I'm looking to enter into a contract with a large company—this isn't expressly stated in the legislation, so here's a tip for those members opposite—wouldn't it be good to see on the front page of the contract a warning that the company that I'm about to enter into a contract with is a small-business slow payer? Wouldn't that be a good idea? If I was a small business and I had the opportunity or perhaps the luxury to enter into a contract with two or multiple sets of businesses and the contracts were on the table and I had one contract that said, 'This company is a lousy payer,' and another that didn't have that on the front page, which one do you reckon I'd go with?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third is to allow the regulator to record in the register that an entity is a slow small-business payer. The fourth is to expand the functions of the regulator to include research, publishing and outreach with respect to payment outcomes. The fifth is to update the objects of the act to reflect the purpose of improving payment outcomes for small businesses and incentivising large businesses to make prompt payments. The sixth is to streamline reporting obligations and decrease the regulatory burden experienced by reporting entities. The seventh is to enable consolidated reporting in accordance with Australian accounting standards to improve the quality, completeness and comparability of data reported on the register. These are all fine things. They're good things. The most important thing, really, out of this bill will be the power to name and shame. It will be the ability or the requirement for a large business that, if it has been declared a slow payer by the regulator, it must put that on its public information documents. That could be a letterhead or their website, one would assume. But, as I said, it should also go on the contract, because that's the most important document when it comes to dealing with a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we are unashamedly pro small business. We don't like red tape. We do understand that this bill creates some red tape for businesses. We understand that. But life is a series of counterbalancing decisions, and, in this case, on this side of the fence, we regard that the importance of ensuring the cash flow of small businesses outweighs the regulatory burden that this would create on large businesses. For those of you who may be listening to this on the radio, a small business is one that has a turnover of less than $100 million. A big business is one that has a turnover of in excess of $100 million. For all those tradies who are out there on building sites, unless they're really making a motza, you're not going to be caught by this legislation. You can relax from a position of being caught by the obligations of this bill but you will receive the benefits when and if you enter into a contract with a large company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The average payment time in this country for businesses is reportedly 37 days. I think that's dreaming, from my own experience as a construction law barrister, particularly in the construction sector. It is not uncommon for small businesses to be strung out by 90 to 120 days. If you are a small business and you are paying your employees, you've bought your materials, you've paid for all of your business overheads, and yet you don't get paid for 90 to 120 days, is it any wonder that we are seeing such an increased number of insolvencies in this country right now? Unfortunately, this is fed by the cost-of-living crisis in this country. Small businesses are absolutely caught up by this cost-of-living crisis. Small businesses often have to mortgage their own homes. I bet the member for Longman did; I sure as hell did. We mortgaged our own homes to be able to ensure that we had enough money to pay our employees, and yet people are now paying three times the interest rates than what they were paying when we were in government. Three or four years ago people were paying around two per cent on their mortgage payments. It's now edging up at around 6½ per cent to seven per cent. If they have an overdraft, it's probably over 12 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-of-living crisis that is being meted out by this government is the root cause of so much of the insolvencies that we are seeing. This is a sensible bill—it needs some amendments, and I look forward to those amendments being moved.</span>

                    <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  I'm really pleased to rise in support of the Payment Times Reporting Amendment Bill 2024. This is fulfilling a commitment that we took to Australians at the last election. This important piece of legislation delivers on our commitment to the nation. Our commitment was to deliver legislation to improve payment times to small businesses, with an emphasis on payments being made within 30 days or less. As part of delivering on this commitment, our government commissioned Dr Craig Emerson to undertake a review of the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020, which has helped to inform how this legislation has been written and will be implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review by Dr Craig Emerson found that, in its current form, the Payment Times Reporting Scheme is ineffective, so this bill overhauls the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 to level the playing field and encourage large businesses to treat their small-business suppliers fairly. The treatment of small business by large business through this mechanism forms the essence of this legislation, and I think it's something that all fair-minded Australians would believe is the right thing for their government to do. We are acting on our commitment that we made during the election. We know small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy, employing more than five million people and contributing more than $500 billion to the national economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Chisholm we are home to 22,545 small businesses, employing tens of thousands of people in my community. These small businesses make an enormous contribution to the fabric of my community. One of my favourite parts of the job is getting to meet and know many small-business owners in the electorate. We recently launched our Chisholm 'shop local' initiative. I was so delighted to host our wonderful Minister for Small Business at a local small-business roundtable recently. I really want to thank everyone who participated in that event. My most recent Shop Local, Love Local campaign has been to encourage the Chisholm community to support local businesses in the lead-up to Mother's Day. My office created the Chisholm Mother's Day gift guide, featuring amazing local businesses, encouraging the community to both shop local and love local. At the end of last year, I was really pleased to see a local small business featured in the parliament gift shop, Tinta Crayons. There are still products available there, if people would like to see some of the fantastic work being undertaken in my electorate and being brought to our nation's capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses that I feature in my gift guides, that I promote throughout my community and that I shop at as well are the ones that stand to benefit most from the legislation before the House. We know how important cash flow and payment times are to small businesses, particularly for small businesses who supply goods and services to larger companies. It's unfair for those larger corporations to delay paying small business invoices. Customers would never think of walking into our local bakeries, newsagents or coffee shops and trying to get away with 90-day payment terms. So this is an important step forward in bringing fairness into our business landscape. We know that late payments affect the cash flow of the business owed the outstanding debt, which forces many small businesses to find ways to finance that shortfall in their working capital and this restricts the ability of small business to use their cash flow to grow or invest in new products and services. We also know that a lack of cash flow is the leading cause of business insolvency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we also know that there has been a growing trend in payment practices, particularly amongst larger multinational businesses, to extend payment times to Australian small businesses. That growth in extended payment times is partly linked to the practices of multinational businesses applying global policies to improve their working capital efficiency. This effectively renders Australian businesses as the low-cost financiers of large and multinational corporations, and that should simply not be so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of fairness that this legislation addresses. It helps to level the playing field for small businesses right across Australia and for the more than 22,000 small businesses in my electorate of Chisholm. Our reforms will reduce regulatory burdens for reporting entities with obligations under the act, incentivise large businesses to improve their payment times and streamline processes and remove inefficiencies. Reforms will also improve outcomes for small businesses and incentivise large businesses to make prompt payment. That includes a shift to consolidated reporting in accordance with Australian accounting standards to improve the quality, completeness and comparability of reported data. Additionally, a mechanism for the Minister for Small Businesses to give a direction to an entity in the lowest 20 per cent of payers overall or industry to make enhanced disclosures is contained here as well. The minister can direct a slow-paying entity to state on its website and in procurement ESG related and other documents that it is a slow small-business payer as well as to inform the market on how to access its payment time reports. The payment times reporting regulator will then place a record in the payment times reporting register that the entity is a slow small-business payer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important reforms and will function as both incentive and disincentive for large businesses as it relates to their small-business payment times. With faster payment times, improved cash flow and fewer administrative burdens, our reforms will make a real difference. We know that better payment times benefit everyone, which results in gains to productivity, supporting higher wages and profits and expanding employment opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are an important part of the Albanese Labor government's better deal for small business. We are delivering for small businesses, helping them to bounce back from challenges and improving their long-term resilience. Our budget is helping to ease the pressure on Australia's small businesses by providing more than $640 million in practical and targeted support. We're extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off, making it easier for small businesses to invest in their business. We'll provide additional targeted energy relief of $325 to around one million eligible small businesses through the Energy Bill Relief Fund. This builds on the up-to-$650 rebate that is being provided in this budget year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also investing $18.3 million in two innovative programs—the cyber health check program and the Small Business Cyber Resilience Service—to help small businesses build their resilience to and bounce back from cyber attacks. This is in addition to the existing $23.4 million our government is committing to the Cyber Wardens program delivered by the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia. We've already delivered $18.6 million to help support small businesses adapt and build resilience through digital technology through the latest round of Digital Solutions, and we are continuing to strengthen this vital sector by investing an additional $10.8 million to extend access to free mental health and financial counselling support for small-business owners. This additional funding builds on the $15.1 million we've already invested in these programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also updated the Commonwealth procurement rules, with small businesses getting a larger slice of the $75 billion in contracts that the Australian government spends every year. This will result in a 20 per cent target for small businesses when it comes to government procurement spend. Unfair contract terms are now illegal, thanks to our action, so small businesses can negotiate fairer agreements with large partners. We've also responded to Dr Michael Schaper's review of the Franchising Code of Conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to supporting small business and to investing in the future ambitions and aspirations of small-business owners right around the country, because we know that small businesses are vital to the fabric of Australian society. We will always do what we can when we can in order to help small businesses and the communities they serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity now to thank the small-business community in my electorate of Chisholm. Our government does not underestimate the investment in resources, time and community that it takes to operate a small business, to recruit and train employees, to organise payroll and to build a future for those owners and their families. Indeed, I grew up in a household where my family ran a small business. I trust these reforms will make a meaningful difference to small businesses right across my electorate of Chisholm and across the country. I'll also take this opportunity to remind people to shop at and love their local small businesses. Thank you so much.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  Small business plays a crucial role in the Australian economy. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mall business data </span><span style="font-style:italic;">re</span><span style="font-style:italic;">port</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: 2023 year in review</span>, approximately 42 per cent of private sector employment is in the small business sector. Small business accounts for 97½ per cent of all businesses, roughly 2½ million, and it generates $500 billion of economic activity. That's a third of Australia's gross domestic product. They are big numbers. They are impressive figures. And we should, as the member for Chisholm has just stated, do everything we can to help small business.</span>

                    </a>  I hear, 'hear, hear' from the member for Moreton. He knows how important small business is in his Queensland community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, we heard—and we welcomed, indeed—the member for Chifley, the Minister for Industry and Science, saying that small businesses need some tax relief—some more tax relief, in fact. He said that the corporate tax rate should be lowered. He's not here this week. Maybe he's been sent for reprogramming by the Treasurer, who I'm not quite sure totally agreed with the member for Chifley's assessment of where the corporate tax rate is or should be, but no doubt the member for Chifley will consider the error of his ways when he goes against the member for Rankin. I say that very facetiously; I wouldn't want people to think I don't believe the corporate tax rate should be lowered, because when I was the small-business minister back in 2016 the small-business tax rate went down to its lowest level in 70 years. I was very proud of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I just said—and the member for Chisholm agreed in her contribution—we should do everything we can to support, to promote and to enhance small business because it's small-business people who take the risk. It's small-business people who open the doors, who pay the rent, who pay the wages. Now they're having to pay even more wages after the announcement this week by the Fair Work Commission that wages are to go up by 3¾ per cent. No-one denies workers should be paid their dues, but it comes on the back of small business; they then have to find, in a cost-of-living crisis, more to pay their workers. What do they do? Do they put the price of their products up? Do they put the cost of their services up? Who ultimately pays for that? It's the consumer, the customer. Someone has to pay. Whether it's superannuation or wages, it's that small-business operator—that person who often pays their employees first, as they should; who puts away money for their superannuation, as they should; and who often gets paid less in small business than the person they employ to help run their shop. I pay tribute and credit to those small-business operators. They are risk-takers. In many cases—that is, farmers—they are price-takers, not price-makers, and they are certainly risk-takers because they operate on the smell of an oily rag. They operate on the whim of the weather gods. They operate on whether or not there are going to be good times in the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about payment times reporting. Indeed, anything that can be done to ensure payment times are what they should be has got to be considered very much on its merit and very much supported by the coalition. But let's just consider the 4 June <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> editorial, which was headed, 'Insolvencies are climbing and could send NSW broke'. Luke Achterstraat was the co-writer of this; he is the chief executive officer of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, so when he speaks we ought to listen. It was co-authored by Denita Wawn—someone very well known to me—the CEO of Master Builders Australia. And she and he, like the good member for Chifley, bell the cat. He calls for a lower corporate tax rate. They, in what could be called a very grim article, wrote about the shocking insolvency figures released just last week detailing the crisis facing small business in my home state of New South Wales:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have a housing minister who talks about increasing the housing stock. I don't necessarily disagree with her, but, when you've got state governments shutting down gas, when you've got state governments like Victoria stopping the timber industry, I wonder how this is going to be met by the housing industry when they are trying to power homes, when they are trying to construct homes. What in goodness knows name will they be building houses out of if they can't use Australian timber? What we'll do is we'll import it. We'll just rape and pillage rainforests overseas to get the timber we need to build houses to accommodate the numbers of migration, which are just not sustainable. The numbers are just not sustainable. In fact, in January and February alone, we welcomed—and I do use the word 'welcomed'—more than 100,000 new citizens in each of those months, as part of the overseas migration intake. That number is equivalent to the yearly total of migrants during the Howard era. This comes on the back of a cost-of-living crisis. This comes on the back of a housing crisis.</span>

                    </a>  That'll be the day! This bill seeks to achieve several outcomes. It's going to create a mechanism to permit the Minister for Small Business to direct an entity found to be in the slowest 20 per cent of payers overall or by industry to make enhanced disclosures to the regulator. It is also going to name and shame. It's going to permit the minister to direct a slow-paying entity to state in public-facing materials that it is a slow small business payer, provide information on how to access its payment times reports and allow the regulator to record in the register that an entity is a slow small business payer. </span>

According to the government, yes. The Payment Times Reporting Amendment Bill is going to expand the functions of the regulator to include research, publishing and outreach with respect to payment outcomes, update the objects of the act to reflect the purpose of improving payment outcomes for small businesses, incentivise large businesses to make prompt payments, streamline reporting obligations and decrease the regulatory burden experienced by reporting entities. It will also enable consolidated reporting in accordance with Australian accounting standards to improve the quality, completeness and comparability of data reported on the register, so it is going to be more onerous on small businesses.</span>

There are small business operators who are finding it very difficult to keep opening their doors and to keep the lights on. That's not just because their power bills are going through the roof but because of the red tape and bureaucracy that this Labor government seems to always want to foist on small businesses. </span>

I know the member for Page has run a successful business. We come to this place with that knowledge, expertise and skin in the game.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is doing so much to impede and hamper small business smoothness and efficiency. I will acknowledge the work being done by Bruce Billson, a former small business minister, heading up the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's office. Small businesses should go to ASBFEO and have a look at what it has available on its website, because it is fast, it's knowledgeable and it will help a small business operate in these difficult times, in these trying circumstances. It will help them with tax and it will help them navigate their way through the various acts, and it is to be encouraged and admired.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I worry about small business. I worry about the fact that unions are dictating the terms to this government, as you would expect. There's always a payday when a Labor government is elected because they've got to pay back their union masters. They've got to pay back those who pull the strings. They are mere puppets of the trade union movement, and that only affects and impedes and slows small businesses across Australia, who need every bit of help from this disappointing government. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  As the minister said in her second reading speech, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They represent 97 per cent of all Australian businesses, around 40 per cent of private sector jobs and 30 per cent of GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses deliver growth, innovation, productivity, employment and support for local communities. I'm very proud of the small businesses in Wentworth who are doing all these things. Some of those businesses, such as florists and cafes, you'll see as you walk down the street, but many of those small businesses will be businesses in the B2B sector. They're people that you don't see, but they are also critical parts of the supply chain. They are the beds of our innovation. There are so many businesses I've seen in Wentworth who may be small now but aspire to great things. So many of the Australian businesses that we have in the community today were small businesses once. It is that innovation, that talent and that drive that we, in this place, need to harness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come to the Payment Times Reporting Amendment Bill, this is a really important bill on the basis that there are important relationships between those small, medium and large businesses. According to the BCA, trade between small and large businesses represents around $700 billion a year. That is enormous. At the same time, in looking at that trade, we need to recognise the environment that our small businesses are operating in right now. It is a hard time to be a small business. Coming out of the COVID pandemic, when lockdowns were in place and demand slumped, businesses now face the enduring effects of inflation, supply chain bottlenecks, a struggling economy, high material costs and, still, difficulty in finding people to employ in their businesses. It is a really difficult time to be in business, and that's something that I hear constantly from the people I know in the business community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, smaller businesses are facing a skewed business environment in the hands of large local multinational organisations that can exert power in different ways. That exertion of power actually stops smaller businesses growing and developing in the way that they would like to. I think this is an important area to address in the parliament. One area where this plays out is in payment times. As a former small-business owner, I know firsthand how difficult it is to manage the timing of cash flows, along with everything else. According to ASIC, inadequate cash flow is the most common cause for insolvencies in Australian businesses, and often, as a small business, this can be out of your hands. My mum often told me that when she started her business she learned very quickly and very early on that you have to get paid. That was a big part of what she used to do, as someone who supplied clothes to bigger businesses. As the owner of a new business starting out she was as obsessive about that as she was about the quality and fit of the clothes she made—because you have to get paid. If you don't get paid, you don't have a business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The small business ombudsman found, in 2017, that large businesses were extending payment terms and delaying payments to better manage their own inventory and essentially using delayed payments as a form of cheap credit. This is undertaken often without consideration for the impact on small businesses dealing with their own cash flow issues. In 2020, the original form of this act established the Payment Times Reporting Scheme to address this issue. The scheme required regular payment time reports from eligible entities to be published on a register which could be accessed by small businesses. The idea was: greater transparency, faster payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A review of the original act published two years later, however, found that the register had no material decrease in payment times and found no evidence that small businesses were rejecting customers based on the reports published. That makes complete sense to me, because, if you're a small business, most of the time you don't get to pick and choose your customers. You're trying very hard to get and build your customer base, so, even if someone is a late payer, if you believe they're going to pay you you're going to stick with them. As of this week, the average payment time is still at 32 days, above the 30-day target period outlined in the legislation, with payment times in many instances extending well beyond this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill strengthens the act from 2020 by implementing greater enforceability and compulsion powers for the regulator. Under this new law, the regulator will have expanded powers to gather information beyond just payment times from large businesses and to enact penalties for the slowest payers and those who fail to comply. The explanatory memorandum outlines that slow payers will be required to publish a statement on their website and other relevant documentation, including procurement documents, invoices and other commercial documents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise what this bill is trying to achieve but I have concerns that, for all its good intentions, it may not achieve the outcomes it seeks. That's because piecemeal solutions without the muscle behind them may not do anything substantial to affect small businesses and may instead just increase the volume of regulation in the economy. Despite the change in this bill, the legislation fails to address the fact that the 2020 review found that small businesses generally don't have the luxury of being choosy as to with whom they conduct business. Even if large companies have to publish their track record, small businesses are unlikely to turn down a major contract because of payment delay. Previous reviews tell us that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mechanisms of this bill are also somewhat dependent on the average. The explanatory memorandum states that the bottom 20 per cent of late payers will be subject to penalties, but currently not even the average payment falls within the target 30-day period. While it means that the most egregious offenders will be punished, there is little incentive for those businesses safely in the middle of the pack until the bottom quintile get their act together. My question to the minister is: is this the best that we can do to get rid of slow payments in our economy? For instance, would the government consider implementing a policy to not use slow payers in public contracts as an additional incentive to see if that's one way that we can actually drive better practices for small businesses?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the government is bringing this legislation forward to try to protect small businesses. I support the ethos and I support what the bill is actually trying to achieve. My big question is whether this will have the muscle to make the difference in the payment times for small businesses that I believe the minister would like to make and that I know small businesses critically need. One last issue I want to raise is that regulators that are established without powers or the means to make meaningful difference to the business community are worse than useless. I see this in the current ACCC, which only has a capacity to deal with 42 per cent of competition complaints, only 70 per cent of which are conducted within the target time of 12 months. So, if we have a regulator that can't actually deliver on the protections, then we don't actually have the protections in place, as much as we might feel that we are passing those protections as we stand here giving speeches in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will support this legislation because I believe this is a significant issue. However, I'm not convinced that it will significantly improve the lives of small businesses in the way that we would like it to. I hope I am proved wrong.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I want to commend the member for Wentworth for her contribution. I was listening intently, and the member is right: unless there's a tough cop on the beat, it's not going to make a difference. It was a wonderful contribution explaining the importance of cash payments. When the member was talking about her mum, I had a flashback to my former boss, good friend and mentor Andrew Blain, who owned Yarra Valley Snack Foods, where I was lucky enough to work for seven years. He spoke to me about the importance of cash flow and used to always say, 'Aaron, just remember: a sale isn't a sale until we get paid.' That's the reality for small business. They don't have millions of dollars in cash reserves. They don't have money sitting there to afford it. On a balance sheet of assets, profit and loss is important, but the lifeblood of a small business is cash flow and having more cash in the bank to be able to pay your employees, pay your suppliers and survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality that we need to acknowledge for many small-business owners and family businesses across Casey and across the country is that, when they don't have the cash, the people that go without are the owners. The owners always pay themselves last. When they don't have the money, they will pay their employees, they will work with their suppliers and, many times, they will go weeks without payment themselves. So we need to do everything we can in this House to make sure that we're supporting small business, that we're creating the conditions for them to succeed and that, when they do make a sale to a big business, they get paid. I want to take a moment to thank all the small businesses in Casey and across the country for everything that they do. You are the engine room of the economy, you drive innovation, you drive economic growth and you take risks, in many cases putting your family house on the line to chase your dream. Our role and our responsibility is to make your life as easy as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments should not be picking winners. Governments shouldn't be backing multinationals and billionaires. They should be focused on creating the economic conditions so small business can thrive. In my community and in many communities across the country, it's the small businesses that give so much back. Anyone who visits a sporting ground in their community will see that. They will see it on the signs around the boundary. Every one of those sponsors is a small and family business giving back to their community. I've seen lots of IGA signs at sporting clubs across my community. I've never seen a Woolworths or a Coles sign at a sporting club in my community. That's why we need to back small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent 15 years working with and in small businesses, dealing with companies like Woolworths and Coles. Let's understand some of the behaviour of these big businesses—some of the behaviour that we need to stamp out. I hope this legislation will have an important role in doing that. As one example, Woolworths and Coles, in their negotiations with small businesses, will say to them, 'We'll pay you within 90 days, but if you give us an extra per cent out of your margin, we'll pay you within 60 days. If you give us another per cent, we'll pay you within 30 days, and if you give us another per cent, we'll pay you within 14. Give us five per cent and we'll pay you within a week.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about this behaviour: this is Woolworths and Coles using their market share to bully small businesses—small family food manufacturers trying to survive—and prop up their profits and their margins at the expense of those businesses. That is some of the behaviour that we are talking about. That is some of the behaviour that we need to eliminate, because, if small businesses don't have cash flow, they won't survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the most challenging time businesses have had. I was speaking recently to a business leader in my community, a man who is not prone to hyperbole or exaggeration. His family business has been operating for three generations. He's been in the business for over 37 years and he said to me that this is the toughest economic environment that he has endured. It is a time when revenues are coming down because people are spending less, and we saw that in the national accounts. Their revenues are less but their expenses are going up. Every expense is going up for them: their rents, their mortgages, their energy bills, their insurance, the raw materials that they're getting from suppliers. Everything is going up and, unfortunately, we're seeing that when we walk through our communities and there are empty shopfronts. We're seeing it in the insolvency numbers. We're seeing it every day. We know it's challenging for small businesses, and we think: what is the government doing to support small business?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always stand in this House and speak on any legislation to support small business, but I was thinking this week that it had been a while since I'd had the opportunity to speak on legislation about small business in this tough economic environment, so I asked my team to reach out to the Parliamentary Library to do a little bit of research. I asked them a simple question: how many pieces of legislation directly related to small business has the Minister for Small Business introduced into this House in the last two years? I was waiting to get that answer, and it shocked and disappointed me when I got the response from the Parliamentary Library, because the fact is that this is the first piece of legislation that the Minister for Small Business has brought to this House in two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are two years into the Albanese Labor government. We are in an environment where small businesses are struggling, and they are getting no support from the government. This week the Parliamentary Library gave me the data that this is the first piece of legislation that is directly related to small business that the Minister for Small Business has brought to this House. We are two years into the government, and it shocks me.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr VIOLI:</span>
                    </a>  It's not always about regulation, Minister for Small Business. It's about supporting them. It's about providing opportunities to help small business grow. The interjection from the Minister for Small Business is: 'You don't want to regulate small business.' That shows how out of touch this government is. Talk about a government that doesn't understand small business! It tries to defend the fact that, in two years, it has brought in no support and no legislation for small business. This is coming from the Parliamentary Library. If you want to dispute the Parliamentary Library, feel free to. But this is the first piece of legislation that the minister has brought to this House. I believe she is on her feet next. She can contradict me and contradict the Parliamentary Library if she likes, but it's not about what you say; it's about what you do. For two years, the Albanese Labor government have abandoned small business. They have abandoned small and family businesses in my community and across the country, and those businesses know it. They tell us every day. The member for Page knows. They tell us that every day when we are talking to them. They feel abandoned. The facts show that they have been abandoned by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation—let's be clear—was enacted in 2020. This was a piece of legislation enacted by the coalition government. It commenced on 1 January 2021. The review was called for by the minister in December of 2022. The minister then got the review in September of 2023. It took until December of 2023 to get a response. We are now in June of 2024 and we've finally got the legislation in this House. It then needs to be enacted. It then actually needs to operate. When you are a small business and your cash flow is under so much pressure, days, weeks and months matter. They make a difference. But, for two years, we have had no legislation from the minister. They have sat on this report for months and years. They're finally bringing it to the House. The first piece of legislation to support small business that the minister brings to the House is actually a coalition piece of legislation. I don't think anything else can sum it up more than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's heartbreaking, because so many families are doing it tough. I was talking to a hospitality venue in my community. The husband and wife who own that venue are now working over 80 hours a week each just to keep the business afloat because they cannot afford to pay the wages of their employees. They are sacrificing time with their family. Their children are having to pull out of sporting organisations and organised sport for two reasons. They don't have the money to pay the fees and for the uniforms and they don't have the time to take their children to the events. They have sacrificed everything for this business. They are sacrificing everything today. They are working so hard. The sad part is that they have been abandoned by this government. That's the reality. That's one story. I could share many more. It is disappointing to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, two years in, we've finally got a piece of legislation and it is a coalition piece of legislation that has been worked up. I think that sums up the Albanese Labor government and the disrespect and disregard they have for small business across Casey and across the country.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I would like to thank those who have contributed to the debate. I know how important small businesses are to the electorates that we represent. The Payment Times Reporting Amendment Bill 2024 is an important part of the Albanese government's commitment to delivering a better deal for small businesses. The bill implements important amendments to the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 to level the playing field by promoting fair and timely payments from large businesses to their small-business suppliers. Our government recognises how crucial prompt payments are to small businesses and their cash flow. We are supporting small businesses to support broader economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a framework of transparency to name best- and worst-paying large businesses. This will create reputational pressure for large businesses, encouraging them to improve their payment times, terms and practices. It is important for the regulator to have appropriate powers to ensure big businesses are meeting their obligations under the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill broadens the regulator's functions to include undertaking research and publishing analysis on payment performance and practices on reporting entities. This research will identify the causes of slow payment practices and barriers to improvements and will provide the public with tools and data to understand and interpret the payment performance of large businesses. At the same time, this bill reduces regulatory burden for entities covered by the act, streamlining processes and removing inefficiencies from the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in this bill implement the government's response to Dr Emerson's review of the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 and complement the other measures the Albanese Labor government is taking to support small businesses. Our budget is helping to ease the pressure on Australia's small businesses by providing more than $640 million in practical and targeted support. We're extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off to make it easier for small businesses to invest and grow their business. We will provide further targeted energy bill relief of $325 to around one million eligible small businesses through the Energy Bill Relief Fund, which builds on the up to $650 rebate that is being provided this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is investing over $60 million to help small businesses uplift their cybersecurity and digital capabilities. We're investing in free mental health and financial counselling support for small-business owners. We've updated the Commonwealth procurement rules, and small businesses are getting a bigger slice of the $75 billion in contracts the Australian government spends every year. We've made unfair contract terms illegal so small businesses can negotiate fairer agreements with large partners. We've responded to Dr Michael Schaper's review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, supporting changes to ensure a fairer franchising sector by requiring all agreements provide a reasonable opportunity for franchisees to make a return on their investment and provide greater access to low-cost legal advice if disputes occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on the government's commitment to improve payment times to small businesses. I am pleased that this important bill will receive support from the opposition and members of the crossbench. I trust members understand how important these reforms are, and I look forward to seeing this bill supported in the Senate. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

We didn't put our heads in the sand and we didn't turn away from this. We made sure that we could face up to the world in saying to them that this is the standard that now everyone must meet. By cutting and running, which isn't the Australian way—not while we're in government, anyway—you will have perverse animal welfare outcomes because that standard will be lost.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you what I did to reform this industry when I was agriculture minister. It was about the stocking density rates on those boats. It was about making sure that we had science and that we reformed the methodology of how we assessed the success of a shipment, whether it be cattle or sheep, to anywhere in the world. It was to make sure that was predicated on world-leading science that was created right here in Australia to make sure that the community had confidence and we set the standard internationally. That science was so intricate that we went from a mortality methodology where the assessment of deaths on a boat of over 60,000 to 70,000 sheep had to be reported if there was one per cent mortality on that shipment to now being down to half a per cent. Instead of going by the mortality, we overlaid that with the cause of that mortality: heat stress. That heat stress is what we made the reforms around. That was very scientific. It was done by eminent scientists and veterinarians that could give us confidence. It went to the very heart of the principle of the reforms that we put in place to make sure that these animal welfare standards would lead to us leading the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, that sheep that travel on these boats now actually put on weight. As someone from western Queensland, let me tell you: animal husbandry is pretty simple. If animals are fed, watered, can walk around and can have a lie-down, they're pretty happy. When they're happy, they put on weight. It's a pretty simple philosophy and pretty simple in terms of what is happening to these sheep that we now have on our boats. We have made sure that each individual boat that comes to this country has its own individual score in terms of the air that flows through those boats. That's important in setting the stocking density rates to ensure that those sheep are happy and content and that there are good animal welfare outcomes. We score each individual boat by the way that it's built and by how much airflow it has. Then we look at each individual animal before it goes on that boat, and we measure to the millimetre the length of wool on each sheep—they're shorn before they go on—and they're allowed on. We also weigh them, and the weight of the sheep is very important as well because that goes into the stocking density rates you can put on these boats, in the pens. That's important because, if you have airflow and you have the weight and you have the length of the wool, that reduces heat stress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we went a step further. What I wanted to do when I was the minister and what our government wanted to do was have truth and proof. We wanted to prove to the Australian community we were leading the world in animal welfare standards in the shipment of sheep to the Middle East. I put in place independent observers that gave truth and proof about how the exporters were treating those animals on the export voyage. That was about making sure we had certainty and currency in what we were doing and what we were saying. They made sure that they built on that science of not just the airflow that was going through the boat, the stocking density predicated on the length of wool and the weight of those sheep; it was also about the pants per minute. We could work out whether sheep were heading into a heat stress situation by the number of pants they were taking per minute. This is a shipment of 50,000 or 60,000 sheep, and we were able to demonstrate that because of the reforms we put in place we would then have precautionary principles taken over by those exporters to ensure there was artificial airflow to reduce the humidity, to allow the airflow to go through and to reduce those pants per minute to ensure there was a good animal welfare outcome. That is something no other country in the world had ever done before, and that is what we did here in Australia.</span>

                    </a>  I'm proud of the reforms we put in place. I don't live in an ideological world; I live in the practical world. I live in a world where this industry will continue whether or not we're there. The agriculture minister says this is a declining industry. His own department refutes that. In 2022 there were 380,000 sheep sent to the Middle East. In 2023 it was 654,000. I don't know whether you need a calculator but that's an increase, not a decline.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you why there was a decrease in 2022 and probably even in 2021: there was this thing called a drought. Being from western Queensland, I can tell you that we destocked. A lesson for those from metropolitan areas: what happens when a drought hits is there is no food, water dries up and you sell your stock, but when the rain comes back you have to restock. Instead of sending sheep from Western Australia to the Middle East, we were sending sheep across the Nullarbor and they helped replenish the east coast and electorates like mine in western Queensland with over two million sheep we did not have and, in fact, would not have been able to procure. We would have had to try and produce, which takes time; I don't think I have to explain to the member for Clark, in particular, about how that happens and the time of gestation. That's about cashflow for farmers; that's about paying the bills. The practical reality is that this industry is in incline, and the only time it isn't is when it's a safeguard for the east coast. When we have challenges on the east coast it's an opportunity to draw on those stock from the west coast and to give us the ability to make money, to pay for taxes and to pay for you and me to sit here in this parliament and make changes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry will continue. Let me tell you: this is not just about us. It is so arrogant for us to sit here and say to those countries in the Middle East, like Qatar and Kuwait and the UAE, 'You are not trusted with our live sheep because we don't believe you have the animal welfare standards.' This is not just about food security; this is cultural as well. This is about respecting their cultural beliefs and giving them the food security they need. This industry will continue whether we're there or not. If we're not there, the countries that will take this market up will be countries like Ethiopia, Sudan and South Africa. I talk about the science of stocking density rates on boats. But they don't work on animal welfare. They work on a mortality methodology—the one that we came from. But they don't work on any stocking density rates at all. Their methodology is to put as many sheep as they possibly can on a boat, and what they get paid for is what is left at the other end. That is horrific.</span>

I actually had the courage, unlike the current minister, to go to the Middle East, after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, and explain to them and give them confidence that we would continue to send live sheep but that there would be conditions and there would be reforms about animal welfare, many of which they had already adopted, not only in terms of shipment but in terms of the processing. They were prepared to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So important is it to them and their food security and their cultural beliefs that they are prepared to spend tens of millions of dollars on new abattoirs. The one that I visited in Kuwait City was brand new, the size of a rugby league field, complete with a viewing area for 2,000 people and a playpen in the corner for the kids. What happens is that you come in, you go out to the yards, you put your tag around the sheep that you want, you wait for the number to come up, you go up to the glass and you watch the sheep being processed and you see that it is processed in the way in which their culture expects it to be. That's respect. That's respect that we've given these countries around their cultural beliefs and their food security. That's the investment that they've made and the importance that they place on it. So that Australia is actually able to send them these sheep, to give them that food security, they live up to the standards that we are asking them to process those sheep in. Now that will be lost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The animal activists jump up and say that there is leakage out of the supply chains and that you see people take sheep out of the pens and put them in the boot of a car and take them home and slaughter them at home. Well, that's going to become the norm. That's what happens when Australia cuts and runs. That is the animal welfare standard that this government is going to sign sheep from around the world up to. How do you value the welfare and the life of one sheep above the welfare and the life of one from another country? If you are morally invested in this as much as those opposite say they are, then how can you do that? How can you morally sit there and value the welfare of an animal from one country over the welfare of an animal from another? I can't. I'm going to stay and get this right. That's why we'll reinstate this industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is this folly about: 'We'll be able to process them all in Western Australia.' Let me give another little agriculture lesson for those opposite. There are some practicalities around this, around agricultural production and understanding the seasonality in terms of supply. If you want to build an abattoir in this country, it's going to cost you the best part of $50 million, probably a bit more. To get a return on an abattoir, you actually have to have it running 365 days a year. That takes a lot of money. It costs a lot of in energy, particularly when you've got an energy policy like this mob have. But you've also got to have the staff. In Western Australia, because it's a seasonal industry, these sheep come off and are sent to the Middle East in a seasonal pattern that goes with their production cycles in Western Australia. You can't keep an abattoir going for 365 days a year. No-one is going to take a punt on $50 million to build an abattoir that can only run for nine months of the year.</span>

How do you find the workforce for six to nine months and shoot them off again? It doesn't pass the commonsense test.

                    </a>  This is the folly that is being sold to Australians—that we can just process them all here—without understanding these decisions. This is what happens when you have a government that doesn't understand agriculture and doesn't understand production cycles. If you were serious about the ideological view you'd taken and you had conviction in what you believed, wouldn't you go and face these people in Western Australia—the 3,000 livelihoods that you're about to rip away? The Prime Minister on election night said that no-one would be held back and no-one would be left behind. That's unless you live in Western Australia. That's unless you're in agriculture. Why wouldn't you go and look them in the eye and say: 'Look, this is the reason why we are shutting down. This is the scientific reason why we are shutting this industry down. This is the economic reason why we are shutting this industry down.' But they have no courage to go and face any farmer or anyone in the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, when the minister went to announce that the phase-out date was May 2028, he flew on taxpayer dollars to Perth to make an announcement at the Commonwealth parliamentary offices by invitation only and Zoomed in every stakeholder in the industry. He didn't eyeball them. He hid in a parliamentary office so that he could do his press conference with Perth in his background. How shallow can a minister be that he doesn't have the courage of his convictions to front up to these people and make an announcement? Go and make the announcement at Katanning. Go to the yards in Katanning and tell them. If you are so convinced about why you are doing this, if you are so righteous, then go and face them. Look them in the eye. That's the Australian way. It's not to just cut and run. If you're going to cut someone's livelihood, have the courage to look them in the eye and tell them exactly what you're going to do and why you're doing it. Instead, this is all ideological.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as that announcement came out, so too did the press releases. The Animal Justice Party takes credit because this is now the reward for the preference deal that they did with Labor in the 2022 election. They did it to get their preferences. It all came out. But we knew that from the start because the animal activists were the ones who announced the closing down of this industry to start with. That's who's running this government. It's not someone who makes decisions predicated on experience or knowledge or industry insight or consultation. That's why you see over a thousand registered trucks and tractors driving through the streets of Perth. They've had a gutful of not being listened to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that but this government is so incompetent. The minister sent his department to tell Kuwait and Qatar that they were going to phase this out. But how incompetent were they? They sent them to the wrong agency. They told the wrong government department that they will no longer have food security because Australia doesn't trust them anymore. They sent them to the wrong department, causing an international incident with a good, significant trading partner from the Middle East. This shows how invested this government has been in its pursuit of shutting down a lawful industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get the passion from some, particularly those from capital cities that don't understand and don't appreciate exactly what happens, but you are talking about the livelihoods of 3,000 Australians, taken away with the stroke of a pen, without a reason, without science, without economics and without acknowledging the reforms that were put in place to protect this industry that this country led and leads the world on. Why would you not have the courage of your convictions to front up and face them and tell them to their face exactly why? Australian governments should be better than that, no matter their political persuasion. They should have the courage to face up and they should have the courage to say to their fellow Australians, 'I'm going to take your livelihood away and this is why.' If you don't then you don't have a social licence to operate, as far as I'm concerned. The people of Western Australia and these producers are, rightfully, wondering where their government is going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way, and we have shown it as a nation, and that's why this industry needs to continue. That's why we still want to see meat processing in this country. We've got to understand the limitations of it in terms of production cycles. It's great for economists and those in capital cities telling us how to operate and how to produce the food and fibre that they enjoy every day, but at some point they might want to have an understanding of the economics of it and how it actually operates. Otherwise, you're going to have a perverse outcome. This is the challenge that we have, and you will see these countries taken up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked the Prime Minister in question time in the last sitting to name one country in the world that has higher animal welfare standards in the export of live animals—anywhere in the world—he could not name one country—zip—because there aren't any. This is the moral dilemma of those opposite who want to take this away. If they're really honest with themselves, when they go and put their heads on their pillows tonight and shut their eyes, they should really ask themselves: 'Have I really saved any sheep? Really? Am I going to save the welfare of any sheep because of these actions?' They won't. The ideology will tell them that; the practicality won't. The practicality of this is that they will have the deaths of millions of sheep—horrific deaths of heat stress, of conditions that we would never support, that no farmer ever supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we did is we led, we reformed and we changed it. We did that with the cattle industry as well. There was an error in 2011—and I mentioned earlier that this government made a knee-jerk reaction and shut it down, which is going to cost about $200 million to $400 million in compensation. But they were given a chance. They reformed it and they reformed the processing sector in Indonesia so that our animal welfare standards were respected in Indonesia. The Indonesians had the respect to lead as well, and to make sure that the animal welfare standards that we expect are delivered there. That's what it is to be part of a global community and to do the right thing, not to cut and run, not to have some ideological view because a minority in this country is asking you for it and because you want their preferences. It's about doing the right thing. It's about leading the world. In regional Australia we have led the world, and we're going to be let down by politicians dripping with self-righteous sanctimony who have zero understanding of this industry. They've never engaged with this industry. They've never engaged with production cycles in any agricultural form, yet they are prepared to sit here and make decisions on these people's livelihoods and futures with the stroke of a pen, without even saying a word to them. That is not the Australia that I know. That is not what regional Australians expect should happen in their parliament. That's not what they expect from their elected members of parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this minister, who voted against a motion we put up last week to have a parliamentary inquiry into this because he failed to go and talk to them, we thought we might get the parliament—and then, within a matter of days, he reverses it and says, 'Yes, there's still a parliamentary inquiry, but let's do it over the next two to three weeks.' That is absolute contempt for those men and women whose livelihoods he has taken away with the stroke of a pen. He's not shutting this industry down till 2028, so wouldn't you think he could give them some respect? Wouldn't you think that he could show the respect to turn up and have a parliamentary inquiry, test his science and test his economics in front of this industry—in front of the men and women whose livelihood he's going to take away. Let's have a debate of ideas on this. Instead, he's shown absolute contempt that they must have their submissions in within less than a week. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's absolute contempt for understanding what farmers and industry are going through. They're not sitting there with bated breath waiting for the minister to ask for a submission. These men and women are out producing your food and fibre. To say that there's limited spaces and limited time for you to go and put your case to your elected officials, to disrespect them and disrespect democracy in the way that this government is proposing to do speaks volumes about them, not the farmers whose livelihoods are being taken away.</span>

Tell us what is enough then? Tell us what would be enough to meet the high standards that this minister believes in, because he'll have to also tell us what the science is.

They can see the contagion that's coming because the animal activists are running this show, and this ban will go from sheep to cattle. It is coming to an industry in a state near you. This is the ideology that's being run by this government.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024. I want to specifically address the measures in this bill which will introduce mandatory climate reporting requirements for large businesses regarding climate-related governance, strategy, risk management and emissions targets, including for greenhouse gases. This will include reporting emissions from supply chains, so farmers in regional elections like mine will be impacted by this bill. Businesses who must comply would meet two out of three thresholds: one, that they have over 100 employees; two, that the value of their consolidated gross assets is $25 million or more each financial year; and, finally, that the business's consolidated revenue for that financial year is $50 million or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome measures that Australia's major companies must now be transparent with and can be held accountable by investors and consumers when it comes to climate change. We must measure how businesses are progressing as they transition to net zero emissions. We're now living in a world impacted severely by climate change. This is accepted internationally. Indeed, this bill makes sure we are in step with international requirements for a credible climate disclosure regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though these measures are necessary, which is why I will ultimately support the bill, I want the House to hear and I want to acknowledge that they will be challenging for some sectors. In particular, the measures will be challenging for the agricultural and primary production sectors. Although some farming businesses won't meet the thresholds for mandatory climate risk reporting, it's important to acknowledge that they are part of the supply chain for larger businesses that will. Emissions from the supply chain are known as scope 3 emissions, and scope 3 emissions reporting will require farmers to report on the emissions from production, including diesel and farm machinery in transport, fertiliser and even methane emissions from cattle. This bill is setting out what is going to happen with or without legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are increasingly required to provide the emission profiles for insurance and banking and to identify opportunities for emissions reductions on their own farms. This may be the case, but I do hear farmers' concerns about meeting emissions reporting requirements. Many farms struggle to calculate and disclose their farm emissions. It's a relatively new part of farming practice. It can be costly, confusing and time-consuming. Many farmers I speak to across my electorate of Indi also tell me that they want to do their fair share in reducing our national emissions but they must be mindful about the expense to their livelihoods. They talk to me about the challenge in balancing these factors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To get the balance right, it's critical that governments provide the resources and support to get farmers up to speed on emissions reporting and don't leave farmers carrying the cost of compliance. Hearing farmers' concerns about emissions accounting and reductions is why, in the 2022 election and last year, I advocated for federally funded agricultural extension officers. Extension officers would work with farmers one-on-one to adopt the technology, products and farming practices that would help them calculate and then lower their emissions to achieve net zero. These extension officers would translate the science into practice, delivering the research on how to accurately measure soil carbon or what nutritional additives could be used to reduce methane emissions in livestock, for example. The advice must be from local, trusted, neutral, independent officers who know the specific environment that the particular farmer is working in, because the techniques applied in low-rainfall, poorer soils will be different from those in high-rainfall, organically rich soils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government funded extension programs have been used historically to help farmers navigate changing times and changing technology. Extension programs have fallen by the wayside in recent times, but I was pleased to see, in last year's budget, the take-up of my idea and the funding of a network of sustainable agriculture facilitators. These facilitators will provide extension services to farmers to build their knowledge of climate-smart practices. This directly replicates my policy, which, I heard from farmers in my electorate, would indeed help bridge this significant knowledge gap. I understand that the design of the sustainable agricultural facilitators is in the final stages and will be delivered by regional development partners, including natural resource management organisations. I very much look forward to learning more as these agriculture facilitators are rolled out, including in my electorate of Indi. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sustainable agriculture facilitators sit within the broader $302 million Climate-Smart Agriculture Program. This program is all about driving agricultural sustainability, productivity and competitiveness by reducing emissions, building resilience to climate change and conserving national capital and biodiversity. Under the latest budget, I was pleased to see an additional $63 million to support the reduction in emissions in agriculture, including $28.7 million to improve greenhouse gas accounting. The National Farmers Federation welcomed this announcement, saying it aligns with what the farming sector has been calling for, giving them much-needed independent advice to make informed decisions about their businesses. More money to help farmers calculate and reduce their emissions is a timely announcement when considering the bill before us right now. It's common sense that the government supports farmers in this way if it is also requiring them to report on climate risk issues like the scope 3 emissions I've just outlined. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the bill, and I will watch the government closely to ensure that they continue delivering the support farmers need to calculate and reduce their emissions. This, in turn, produces sustainable, productive and profitable food and fibre needed to feed and clothe our nation and to remain competitive in international markets. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024. I will focus my comments on schedule 4, which provides for the introduction of mandatory climate related financial disclosures, a positive and long-overdue reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times in this place about the risks posed by climate change, and these are getting greater every day. A few weeks ago, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> revealed that hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists expect global temperatures to rise by at least 2.5 degrees, 'blasting past internationally agreed targets and causing catastrophic consequences for humanity'. Climate change poses huge risks to our society, and there are specific risks for our business community and the financial sector. This includes both the physical risk of a warming planet, like increased fires and floods, and the transition risks associated with moving to a net zero world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Internationally, one of the tools being used to manage these risks is mandatory climate related financial disclosures. These disclosures are a key enabler of corporate climate action because they help companies identify and manage the genuine risks that climate change poses to their businesses, because they provide the transparency that helps shareholders and the public invest in the net zero economy, and because they hold companies accountable for setting and meeting their climate goals. This work has been led globally through the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and, subsequently, the International Sustainability Standards Board—global progress to tackle a global problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandatory standards are now in place in economies worldwide. The UK introduced a mandatory climate related financial disclosures requirement in 2022. The European Union has a directive in place covering both large European firms and more than 10,000 non-European companies. In March this year, the US introduced its own long-awaited disclosure requirements. Once all pending disclosure rules are enforced, it is estimated they will cover nearly 40 per cent of the world's economy, also including Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore, so it is absolutely time that Australia acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst many large corporations listed on the ASX are already preparing sustainability and climate change reports, these disclosures are not consistent, not mandatory and not adapted for the Australian context. If we want a future to be made in Australia, if we want to attract the kind of capital that is critical to becoming a green energy superpower, if we want to meet even our modest climate targets, then investors need transparent and consistent information, and this is what this bill seeks to provide. It requires entities to make an annual climate statement which identifies the climate risks and opportunities they face, outlines their plan for managing these and sets out their climate related metrics and targets, including entities' scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill takes a phased approach to introducing these standards, with the very first reporting period starting on 1 January 2025 for 729 very large companies categorised under the legislation as group 1 entities, which are broadly comparable in size to those listed on the ASX. There are further grace periods for the so-called group 2 and group 3 entities, with medium-sized entities in group 3 not required to provide full disclosures if they can show they have no material exposure to climate change. This phased approach is appropriate, particularly when it comes to the group 3 entities, the smallest companies captured by this regime. I urge the government to take the lead from countries like Singapore, where significant support has been provided to help comply with the new reporting regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is particularly relevant for my community in Wentworth. Over the past two years, I've spoken to many constituents, from those in the banking sector to venture capital investors to clean energy companies, who recognise the importance of this kind of transparency and disclosure being provided for in this legislation. I want to commend the government on the broad support for this legislation which exists across the financial, business and non-government sector. When this bill was introduced, 15 of Australia's most influential organisations representing business, finance, and investors came together to support the passage of schedule 4, including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Property Council, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Australian Sustainable Finance Institute. Together, the group represents more than 900 companies, investors with over $80 trillion worth of assets under management and 7.7 million retail shareholders. It is great that they're backing the bill, as are those across the climate and environmental community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, whilst this is a good bill, I do have some concerns about the unintended consequences of certain provisions in the legislation, specifically the modified liability provisions. Under the legislation, entities must report on matters including their scope 3 emissions, scenario analysis on the impact of climate change on their business, and, critically, their transition plans—that is, the set of steps they are taking to transition their business to a net zero world. These are incredibly important disclosures. They may be challenging to put together in the first instance, but they go to the heart of the kind of transparency and accountability that this bill seeks to mandate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the government has inserted modified liability provisions into this bill, which means that no legal action can be brought against entities in relation to these disclosures for the first three years of the new regime. ASIC will still be able to bring actions against businesses for claims that are misleading or deceptive, but the right of third parties, including investors, to do this has been removed. The weakening of this legal check and balance may undermine some of the policy intent of the new regime. As currently drafted, the bill may prevent action such as the 2021 case against Santos for misleading and deceptive conduct, which was brought when Santos claimed they had a credible pathway to net zero by 2040, despite plans to open up new major gas projects. This bill should enable companies to be more accountable for their climate transition plans, not less.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand there are practical difficulties for businesses having to meet new reporting requirements. It's not easy to get things right the first time, and there are inherent challenges with calculating scope 3 emissions, choosing the right scenarios to analyse climate impacts and plotting your company's path towards net zero. Large ASX listed companies, such as the group 1 entities captured by this bill, have the resources to comply with these new reporting requirements, and many have been making similar disclosures for some time. I'm not sure if they need three years to get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have much more sympathy for medium-sized businesses like the group 3 entities covered by this bill. As a former small-business person, running a small business myself, I don't underestimate the challenge of meeting new reporting requirements. When you're cash-strapped and short-staffed it won't always be easy to get your sustainability disclosures right the first time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the modified liability provisions in this bill, it's a mixed bag. I think it's appropriate that companies, particularly those in group 3, have some protection in the early years. I think it appropriate that these projections go to scope 3 emissions and scenario analysis in particular. And I think there is a role for these projections in helping companies make the most ambitious disclosures possible, rather than focusing very narrowly on regulatory compliance and needing to pull back on their disclosed decarbonisation plans for fear of litigation. I note the strong community support from the business community for modified liability provisions. I also note the bar for litigation for misleading disclosures in comparable regimes such as the UK is far higher than that provided for in this legislation. I'm also concerned that the provisions may make it easier for large fossil fuel companies like Santos and Woodside to greenwash for the next three years and to claim that they're committed to net zero whilst investing in new fossil fuel projects. I'm hesitant about removing these protections entirely, so I urge the government to look at whether they have achieved the right balance between these two competing priorities as this bill moves forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important piece of legislation, and I commend the Treasurer and his colleagues for the broad support it has received. In closing I also urge the coalition to reflect on the support this bill has from the financial and business sectors and to support the provisions in schedule 4. If you're serious about taking action on climate change and seizing the opportunities of the green transition, you need to support legislation like this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not about being pro- or anti-climate. It's not about being pro-emissions reduction or otherwise. This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024, unhappily, is about being pro or anti small business. This is an anti-small-business bill. The bill puts an unacceptable compliance burden on the Australian economy at a time when the government is claiming it will reduce their compliance burden. It puts compliance obligations on Australian companies that are completely out of line with our international peers—with the US, with the UK and with Canada. Sadly, the bill creates the risk that small businesses will only be able to contract with, bank with or sell to larger businesses. It accelerates the trend of debanking we are seeing amongst our farmers, miners and resources industry more generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to get this economy back on track we have to get back to basics, and right at the heart of that is getting red tape, regulation and compliance burdens—which is what this will be, of $3.2 billion, and I think that's a conservative estimate—out of the way. We have to allow small-business people to get on and do what they do—invest, create jobs, take risks and create opportunities for themselves and all their stakeholders like their customers, their suppliers and their employees. You can't do that when you're wrapped in red and green tape, which is exactly what this is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of the bill implement recommendations of the financial market infrastructure regulatory reforms to strengthen the financial market infrastructure. We support these changes, but we have grave concerns about the proposal to remove parliamentary scrutiny of changes to voting power on the ASX. Currently, changes in voting power to the ASX are limited to 15 per cent and any change requires regulations to be altered and subject to disallowance. This amendment instead confers this power to ASIC, with ministerial approval—so the power of disallowance is removed, and we have concerns about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the mandatory climate disclosures, schedule 4 of the bill generally requires that entities that lodge financial reports under chapter 2M of the Corporations Act meet certain minimum size thresholds or have emissions reporting obligations under the NGER Scheme to make disclosures relating to climate in accordance with relevant sustainability standards made by the AASB. Schedule 4 implements a climate reporting regime that is stricter, more onerous and more widely applied than that of any of our trading partners. ASIC chair Joe Longo has described the changes as the biggest change to corporate reporting in a decade. At maturity, the scheme will require all companies with turnovers above $50 million to disclose audited and assured scope 3 disclosure statements. ASIC will have full enforcement powers from commencement, but there will be a safe harbour from private litigation for just three years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the point that this is about disclosure of emissions—not just scope 1 and scope 2, which is what you typically see around the world, but scope 3. What are scope 3 emissions? They are the emissions of those companies that are reporting on their customers. It's a bank having to disclose the emissions of its customers. It's a fertiliser supplier having to disclose the emissions of its customers. It's a merchandise provider or a livestock agent having to disclose the emissions of its customers. Every farmer in Australia should be deeply concerned about where this is going, every tradie in Australia should be deeply concerned about where this is going and every small manufacturer should be deeply concerned about where this is going, because their banks and their other service providers and suppliers are going to have an obligation to start reporting their customers' emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt every activist in the country is absolutely salivating at the opportunity to say to that bank, 'I tell you what; we're going to do everything we can do to put you out of business unless you tell your customers how to run their businesses.' They will be telling beef producers how to run their businesses. They will be telling wool and lamb producers how to run their businesses. They will be telling tradies and builders how to run their businesses. They will be telling small manufacturers how to run their businesses. This is what the government is doing here: they're going to outsource activism to the banks and to other major service providers. When I say 'major', it's only companies over $50 million. The red tape compliance bomb here is unimaginable, and I am deeply concerned about where this is going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a Labor Party that thinks the only good business is a business that's fully unionised, I guess it's completely understandable. It's completely understandable that small business is your enemy when you are in the Labor Party. Small business can't be easily controlled by activist union officials, so what do you do? You wrap it in red tape until you throttle it. You asphyxiate it, and that is exactly what this bill is doing. There is so much that Labor has not explained in what they are planning here. How are they going to prevent activists saying to the banks, 'Stop lending to a farmer who doesn't do as they are told'? That is exactly where this is going to end up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most extraordinary about this is that even the US, with a government that's not on our side of the political aisle, is not going down this path. The UK is not going down this path. New Zealand is not going down this path. The inclusion of scope 3 emissions is a step beyond what is reasonable for small businesses. They will pay a very, very high price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you deal with a cafe owner selling coffee in the lobby of a big company? How is that going to work? They're going to have to disclose their emissions to that big company. Quite seriously, the way this is being done is just beyond laughable. A building supplier—a small tradie—providing office fit-outs to a big company is going to have to work out the emissions from his or her ute and report that to the company they're doing the fit-out for. If you're a manufacturer buying ingredients or components from a big company, or selling them—either way, actually—the law will eventually get you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a kind of outsourcing of activism, which this government seems to love. We know that Labor are funding environmental activists, like the EDO, to ensure that they get what they really want. They get what they really want: the shutting down of some of the most important projects for the future of this country. Labor don't like these industries, so they will asphyxiate them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC made clear in its evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that these compliance costs will be passed on to small businesses. They've made that clear; ASIC haven't sought to hide that. They have confirmed that these concerns are so extensive they have been raised with ASIC by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has noted exactly the same concerns, and it's why the US are not proceeding with scope 3 emissions in their regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor need to see sense here, and we've attempted with this amendment to lay out a sensible pathway forward on this—a pathway that respects the role of small businesses in our economy, that recognises they are actually the engine rooms of so many of our electorates. I know members here, when I look around, would say small businesses and farmers are the backbone. I suspect that's true of those on the other side of the chamber. I know it's true of those on the other side of the chamber. But they have never been inside the Labor tent, so they're not going to get looked after; in fact, they're going to be hit hard by this. At a time when we've seen almost 16,000 businesses go into insolvency since Labor came to power, this is the wrong law. It's the wrong law at the wrong time. We are in the midst of a cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business crisis, and it's absolutely the last thing that is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent research shows that red tape costs the economy more than $176 billion a year, and this is going to add very significantly to those costs. We heard through Senate estimates this week, from Treasury and agency officials, who will bear the brunt of this cost. It isn't big businesses. They'll pass it on. They're not the ones who are going to bear the brunt of it. They have big departments doing this, they hire consultants—they do all of that so they can manage it. Those costs are relatively small in the scheme of the budgets of big businesses, but small businesses, who no doubt are going to have to report all of this to their suppliers and service providers, are not in a position to do it. It's not the multinational companies that are going to bear the brunt of this; it's small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury analysis confirms that this bill imposes $2.3 billion in compliance costs in its first year of operation. Of course, there's no productivity benefit whatsoever in it, but productivity is not something that those opposite seem to care about. That's why productivity has gone backwards savagely under Labor. It has flatlined, according to the latest national accounts. Someone among those opposite is going to have to explain to me how you get inflation down and the economy growing at the same time as labour productivity is in freefall. The truth of the matter is that it is just not possible. It is just not possible to achieve that, and when we wrap small businesses in more red tape, as this legislation is doing, we just make the situation worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way than all of this. There is a better way to get the country back on track, and it is getting back to basics. It's recognising that you've got to get the productive side of your economy right, and the heart of that, as I said earlier, is small businesses and farmers, which are the engine room of our electorates, the engine room of our economies, the engine room of our communities. Every local member knows—we regional members in particular see it—that it's a few terrific, outstanding businesses, led by great businesspeople, in our local areas—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I thank the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hume, for his amendment and wholeheartedly support the commonsense, back-to-basics solutions to what is a draconian bill that's going to have a significant impact on every Australian. This is going to drive up your cost of living. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, this government is going to add an extra $2.3 billion worth of red tape costs to those people in particular who are producing the food that you enjoy every day. This mandatory reporting around scope 3 emissions means that farmers in my electorate, little old Maranoa, such as a beef producer in Roma selling their beef to Woolworths, will have to be able to disclose to Woolworths and to their bank their emissions profile. That's an enormous cost. There's not even the science for these farmers to do that at a reasonable cost, so that cost is going to have to be borne by you, the Australian taxpayer, because you're going to have to pay more at the checkout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would you impose an extra cost on farmers when there are families today that are making real decisions at supermarkets? They're putting fresh produce back on the shelf because they can't afford it. They can't afford a meal. They're actually feeding the kids rather than themselves because they don't have the money to go to the supermarket to have three meals a day. In a country of 27 million people, we produce enough food and fibre for 80 million people, and we have a cost-of-living crisis where people are making those decisions in this country today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as legislators have an opportunity to do something about that, to reduce the costs, not increase the costs. We had the Minister for Climate Change and Energy and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry turn up to Toowoomba about a week and a half ago for a sustainability conference with the agricultural industry, telling them that we would never impose mandatory reporting of scope 3 emissions of farmers—'We wouldn't impose that on you.' Well, in this bill they're not, but they're doing it by stealth. They didn't have the courage to look those farmers and those industry people in the eye and tell them, 'Well, actually, we are, because, when you go to the bank, they're not going to be able to lend you a cent unless you can give us your emissions profile.' They are doing it by stealth. If you believe so passionately in this ideology, then have the courage to look Australians in the eye and tell them the truth: that you are going to ask little old farmers out there that are producing the food and fibre that you want. You're going to hit them with another cost—$2.3 billion a year. That is what's going to be added to everything we do in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, no-one's against us trying to reduce our emissions, but there is a uniquely Australian way of achieving it. Part of that should be common sense. Unfortunately, what this bill fails to achieve in any way is common sense. To actually impose this on primary producers when you've already had 16,000 small businesses go into liquidation since Anthony Albanese came to government—you've got to ask: why would you continue to put pressure on those who employ people in our country? Governments don't create jobs; small businesses do. The only jobs that are created here the poor old taxpayer pays for. So you should be creating an environment for our small businesses—and that includes farmers—to be able to employ people. If you impose this type of ideology on our primary producers, then it has to get passed on to taxpayers. I say to this government, when you go and look people in the eye and you give them a promise that you wouldn't be mandating around climate disclosures, and you do that publicly, then you should follow through. What this means is it's not just the banks; it's also the Elders agent and the Nutrien agent who sells them chemicals or cattle, because they get caught up in this. They have to report the scope 3 emissions of their customers. That's the little old farmer in Roma and the little old farmer in Wagga sitting there producing your food and fibre. The ideology doesn't meet the practical reality of what it's going to cost the Australian taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can have all this grandiose ideology, but, ultimately, there's one simple principle in life: someone's got to pay. That's what this mob is forgetting—someone's got to pay. There's also a little chestnut in the top drawer of this government that they've been in consultation with the agricultural industry around. It's around the safeguard mechanism and methane and the fact that they signed up to an international pledge of a 30 per cent reduction in methane by 2030. The agriculture and meat industries are all for trying to reduce emissions, but the safeguard mechanism was put in place to allow technology to be created and then adopted over time by 2050 to allow industry to reduce their emissions. There is no technology, no scientific way, to reduce methane from cattle. We can't do it yet. Instead, the consultations with this government—and on their past record of what they did in Toowoomba a couple of weeks ago, saying, 'No way in the world will we mandate this'—have been telling them that the big beef producers in this country will fall into the safeguard mechanism. They must reduce their methane emissions by 4.95 per cent every year between now and 2030. There's no technological solution to do that, so the only way to do that is to reduce your herd numbers, and, if you reduce supply, prices go up. If you think it's tough buying meat at the check-out at the moment, wait until that little chestnut hits you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the insanity of it. Our 20 biggest beef producers are now being threatened with effectively being put under a safeguard mechanism that will actually drive up the cost of food. At some point, the ideology has to get to the practical reality about food security for every Australian. They should be able to go to a butcher or a supermarket in this country and not have to miss out on a meal. I would have thought this place, this great institution that we have been given the privilege to stand in, would have thought primarily that that is one of the core responsibilities that we have been given—to ease that burden on our fellow Australians so that they can have three meals a day. I think it's a shame on all of us that there are families making those heart-wrenching decisions at supermarkets every day today. So why would you make it worse? Why would you add $2.3 billion of extra costs onto farmers in this reckless race to try to achieve a goal by 2030?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a human toll to this. That human toll is those young families and those young people who are at university or in low-paying jobs who are making those decisions today. I would have thought it was up to every one of us to make sure the decisions they make at that supermarket are about making healthy choices, about having the freshest and best-produced food in the world—from Australian farmers. Unfortunately, this government is going to put that continually out of the reach of those people. That's the human toll the decision this government is going to make today will have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Australians need to understand the ideology of this government. While I respect they have a different view to me, and I respect their ideology is different, I just believe there's a different way we can achieve this. There is a uniquely Australian way. We can use some common sense. We can use the sovereignty of the resources that we have been blessed with in this country to achieve all our international commitments without the human toll—without the heart-wrenching toll on people right around this country every day. But, if this government is hell-bent on this ideology, understand that human toll will grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not what we should be about in this place. That's not what we've been given the privilege to come and do. We've been given the privilege to come here and make Australians' lives better and easier. But, instead, an ideology has got in the way of the practical reality. So I commend the amendment that the shadow Treasurer has made, because that is the basic common sense that we've got to get back to. You can't keep spending Australian taxpayers' money to solve the nation's problems and you can't keep taxing them into submission, because there is a human toll and that human toll will be squarely at the feet of the Albanese government.</span>

                    <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the amendment moved by the member for Hume. There's a lot in this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024. Some of it we agree with and some of it we would wave through. I'm going to touch very briefly on the payments reform part of this bill, and then I really want to go in and talk about the mandatory climate disclosures and what that is going to do if this bill goes through as drafted by the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, with the payments reform, as the member for Hume said, we're very concerned about the proposal to remove parliamentary scrutiny over the changes to the voting power on the ASX. Currently those voting powers are limited to 15 per cent, and any change requires regulations to be altered. We've moved amendments on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's go straight to the mandatory climate disclosures. I think that, if you were to look at any bill and any legislation that passes through this parliament, somewhere in there you'd see, I hope, good intentions or something altruistic that is good for the community, good for the country, good for businesses and good for families. I suppose, in some way, you can see what this government is trying to do here, and you can see an altruistic plan that they have about this. But, again, as the Leader of the Nationals just articulated, what this bill does and what this really quite extreme left-wing government that we have in power at the moment—I'll actually say this is probably the most extreme left-wing government we've seen in this country for many, many decades.</span>

                    </a>  Since the last Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOGAN:</span>
                    </a>  I think they're much more extreme than the last Labor government, with all due respect, Member for Riverina. They're more extreme than the last Labor government. They're more extreme than the Hawke-Keating Labor governments. This is an extreme left-wing Labor government, and I think that this legislation is showing that and proving that. Why am I saying that? Well, let's go through it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the terminology that's been used is quite accurate. Their ideology is making them blind to common sense. Their ideology about what they want to achieve altruistically means that they don't have any regard for what that means on the ground for the men and women of Australia, whether that be families or businesses. They are oblivious to that because every form of legislation that they have is completely fixated on ideology. They say: 'This is what we want to achieve, and we're going to go for that even if that decimates business or makes the cost of living higher. Whatever the cost is, we don't care.' That's what makes this government so dangerous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They get up every day and talk about the cost of living and say that dealing with the cost of living is the No. 1 topic on their agenda and that they are working every day as a government to deal with the cost of living. This bill alone increases the cost of living, and there are many other examples. In fact it's the case for most of the legislation they move through this place. So they can say what they like. They can say whatever they want in here to try to get a sound bite that they think may resonate on a news clip with the families and the business of Australia. That news clip might be what they think Australians want to hear, and it probably is if it's a grab. But let's look at what they're doing here in practice and what they're doing with this bill in practice. This bill that we are debating right now that was drafted by the Labor Party and that they want to pass is going to increase the cost of living for every Australian—full stop. I don't think you'll hear any of them try to get up and defend it and say that it won't. This is not us saying that; this is independent analysis about what the cost of this bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is going to cost over $1 million for any business that does this. I'll repeat that. This was said in Senate estimates this week: it will cost over a million bucks for a business to go through this. Again, we have moved an amendment, but we will be opposing this bill without that. I note other speakers have said this as well. The ASIC chair, Joe Longo, has described the changes as the biggest changes to corporate Australia in over a decade. This is not a minor bill. This is not just something little going through with Labor trying to do the right thing. What they are doing is making a drastic change to the reporting requirements of businesses in Australia that is going to cost the economy billions of dollars. Guess who'll pay those billions of dollars in extra costs? It will be the Australian family and the Australian consumer. Well, thanks for that. The next time you get up and bleat on about the fact that you think that the cost of living is important, have a look at the legislation you are passing every day on the back of this. It is just ideology. They don't have common sense. It's ideology over everything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through this and talk about it. I know a lot of people in Australia might not necessarily understand what we're talking about. We've talked about scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are reasonably easy for a company to determine. It's really just, if you're making something—say, you're a small manufacturer—you measure the emissions that you put out. Most companies do that now and have a fairly good idea about that. Scope 2 emissions are the electricity ones, and most electricity providers have really good systems for measuring the emissions they put out. That's not complicated. But scope 3, which is what this government has in this regulation, is where the problem is. This is where the reporting is going to be difficult. This where the cost is going to be put onto business. This is a higher compliance than in places like the US, New Zealand and the UK. They haven't got it. The US didn't go there. Look at how left-wing Joe Biden and his government are. They haven't done this. They haven't regulated this. But this extreme left-wing government, this exceptionally ideologically driven government, don't care about the increased costs, don't care about the onerous compliance costs, don't care about the cost this is going to put onto small business and don't care about the costs that are going to be transferred to Australian consumers, families and businesses. That's what we're talking about here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to repeat some figures because it is important that we hear them again. This is a $2.3 billion-a-year compliance cost. This is at a time when cost of living is really difficult. Small businesses are doing it really tough. We know that everyone's electricity bill has gone up. Inflation is very high in Australia, most of it homegrown. This government does not care. If this government cared about the exceptionally high inflation rates that we have in Australia, it wouldn't be throwing on top of us a $2.3 billion-a-year compliance cost to strangle business and which will be passed on to families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the type of people who are affected by this as well. With scope 3, all the financial institutions will be starting to look. All the activists will be on this. The government is also funding the Environmental Defenders Office to make sure this is done properly. That's just a team of activists—talk about ideologically driven. I don't think they will care if a business is shut down if they don't like what the business does or they don't think that business is doing the right thing. They don't have any compassion for the business or the people who work there. They will be the police of this. This will part of the requirement of this, which will be disastrous as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said, this will be a creeping thing. So this will not just affect big business. Big business is obviously the first round of this. If you are over a certain size of turnover and staff you will have this obligatory reporting. Those financial institutions and some of those businesses will be looking down their supply chain for some scope 3 issues. They will be coming to farmers, small manufacturers and a lot of other businesses and saying, 'You need to measure and tell me what emissions you have in your business.' I say to those opposite: you are talking with a forked tongue when you say you care about cost of living when in the same breath you are passing this legislation and other legislation, which we might be talking about later today, which is the same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You were saying you care about the cost of living; your words say that, but your actions say something exactly the opposite. Australian families and Australian businesses are going to suffer because of this legislation and other legislation that you're putting through. Your words do not match your actions. Your words say you care about the cost of living; your actions say you do not care about the costs and the extra costs you're putting on Australian families and Australian businesses. They will be worse because of the government you are—the extreme left-wing government you are—and the legislation you keep passing. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow the member for Page's contribution, and I also note the contributions from the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Nationals earlier in this debate. We were just upstairs in the Federation Chamber talking about the appropriation bills and reflecting on the vast difference there is between what this government says and what it actually does. I say frequently to people, 'Don't listen to what they say; look at what they do, because nine times out of 10 they are two completely and utterly different things.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member from Page has quite rightly pointed out, this bill will not help reduce the cost of living. It will actually increase the cost of living for each and every Australian. We've moved a set of amendments to try and make this bill better. I doubt the government is going to support those amendments we will move, because we don't support this bill because we think it's fundamentally antibusiness. As you look at this bill it reaches into every aspect of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people probably don't realise that we already have some reporting requirements for large businesses in terms of scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are emissions that they've either directly generated or indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity or other inputs into the business. What we're talking about essentially in this bill now are scope 3 emissions, which are indirect greenhouse gas emissions that aren't included in the scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions but occur in the value chain of an entity including both upstream and downstream emissions including financed emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medium-sized business could be caught by this. There are three groups of entities. Group 1 entities have consolidated revenue of $500 million or more or consolidated group assets of a billion or higher, group 2 entities have consolidated revenue of $200 million or more or consolidated gross assets of $500 million or higher, while group 3 have consolidated revenue of $50 million or higher or consolidated gross assets of $25 million or higher. All of those entities are required to report or will be required to report the scope 3 emissions from all of their suppliers upstream and downstream. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens to a small manufacturing business in the electorate of Forde that supplies four or five of these companies? How do they account for the emissions that they generate? By the way, they don't have to do this currently. They're exempt from the current scope 1 and scope 2 emissions regime. So, they've got to bring in a set of consultants to go through their entire business and work out what their emissions are so they can start to report them. How do they account then to each of their suppliers what the emissions component of the goods that they supply them are?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that in this bill there's an estimated cost of $1.3 million per year for these large businesses that have to comply with these requirements and an overall estimated economic cost of some $2.3 billion in regulatory impost for no productivity gain whatsoever—zero. We're already in an environment where productivity is declining. We're seeing a new set of regulations that's only going to make productivity worse because it is of no productive value to the country whatsoever, unless you're a consultancy business that actually has to calculate these emissions for all of our small businesses across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are small businesses that don't have HR departments and don't have in-house accounting teams. They get up each and every day and open their doors, putting that families' livelihoods and futures on the line to employ Australians and produce goods that those opposite say they want produced in Australia under their Future Made in Australia goal. But, again, what are they doing? They're just putting another roadblock and another hurdle in the way of the small businesses in this country, which take the risks to innovate, grow and develop the ideas that will benefit this country into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that they want to spend several billion dollars on their made in Australia fund they're actually making it less attractive for business to stay in Australia. The Assistant Treasurer, who's in the chamber at the moment and I'm sure will sum up after I've finished, made a comment in the Federation Chamber earlier, in consideration in detail, about where we want products to be manufactured. I can tell the House that I want products to be manufactured in this country by Australia so that they can afford to keep a roof over their heads, feed their families and build the wealth and creative capacity of this country. That's what I want to see, but as I look at this bill I don't see that happening, sadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking to one of my local manufacturers, a textile manufacturer, quite recently. That manufacturer is actively discussing shutting down and moving overseas because it is just becoming too difficult to do business in Australia. What is one of the key inputs that is becoming so expensive for them? It is electricity and gas. Yet this government promised before the last election that they would reduce electricity and gas prices. They've done nothing of the sort. Rest assured, that business that I just mentioned will be caught in this legislation, which will make it even less attractive for it to stay here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure the House that the estimate of a $2.3 billion impact on our economy is so far short of the mark that it is beyond funny. I would suggest that that $2.3 billion cost has been calculated on those group 1, group 2 and group 3 businesses. I doubt very much that the government or Treasury has done the work to identify the economy-wide costs for every single business in our economy of having to comply with the regulation in this proposed legislation. This is on top of the myriad of other things that this government is doing to make life difficult for business. Whether you're a small manufacturer in my electorate of Forde or a farmer in the electorate of Riverina, you are going be impacted by this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody has really talked about or mentioned at this stage what is also potentially going to happen. We have seen it occur overseas or at least raised as a question overseas. What are the banks going to do with their finance facilities and businesses that are caught up in this? What reporting will businesses have to provide to their banks as part of their loan application process? What if they have an existing finance facility rollover or upgrade of their finance facilities? What about at review time? What additional information will they have to provide? If the bank doesn't like the questions that the business is providing—bear in mind that the banks are caught in this, potentially—what is the risk that the bank says, 'We don't want you as a customer anymore because we don't believe you're doing the right thing with reporting your emissions,' or, 'We don't think you are reporting them properly,' or, 'There is an increased risk to your business because of your emissions profile'? What happens in that case? Can they go to another bank and get their finance facility refinanced or not?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many holes in this piece of legislation and so many risks being introduced into our economy as a result of this that it is beyond belief that those opposite can stand there, hand on heart, and say that they're a government that supports small business, as we saw the Minister for Small Business do this morning. Virtually each and every piece of legislation they bring into this place—and this is a classic example—says exactly the opposite. When 98 per cent of businesses in this country are small-to-medium businesses that employ more than 50 per cent of the Australian workforce, what is the economic impact of this piece of legislation? I would suggest that it is way more than $2.3 billion. Each and every Australian will pay the price for this. All of those sitting in the gallery, everybody that's watching this and everybody out there in the Australian community—everybody will pay the price for this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Page quite rightly pointed out, the government is funding environmental activists, like the Environmental Defenders Office, to ensure that these regulations are complied with. We know their track record. We know what a court said about the Environmental Defenders Office recently, and I can say that it wasn't very flattering. It wasn't very flattering at all. To think that the government is empowering a group of people that want to shut down our economy or shut down particularly businesses they don't like because they don't fit within their zeitgeist, with the economic consequences for our country that that entails, is extraordinary. I thought they were supposed to be a government that govern for all Australians, not just their selected vested interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that we as a coalition are opposing this bill, and we will make every effort to try and ensure that it doesn't pass this parliament, because of the cost-of-living consequences and the risk to business in an already difficult business environment where electricity costs have been going up and rent costs have been going up. If you think there's a rental crisis in the housing market, which there is, there is a rental crisis for many small businesses as well, with the inflation rates that they have been subject to by this government, which doesn't seem to know how to get inflation back down to any sensible level. It's now stuck at one of the highest levels around the world. This is only going to compound this. As these costs flow through the economy, businesses will put up their prices. If they can't put up their prices, they're going to let people go. Where we already have the situation where households with average mortgages in my electorate and across the country are $35,000 a year worse off as a result of this government's inaction, what are the broader economic consequences of this legislation? I think the government should take this and go away and rethink it, or actually put it in the bin, because it will be extraordinarily detrimental to our economy and will make the situation worse, not better. I'm pleased, as I said, that the coalition opposes this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  For the benefit of all members of the House and any members of the public who might be listening in, I thought I'd draw people's attention back to what the subject matter of this legislation is, in complete contrast to the febrile contributions from the member for Hume, followed and backed up by the member for Page, who painted a very dark picture of their own imaginings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 does two things. The first thing that it does, through schedules 1, 2, 3 and 5, is that it amends the Corporations Act 2001 and makes a bunch of consequential amendments to establish a crisis management regime for clearing and settlement facilities in Australia. It's absolutely critical we do this, because clearing and settlement facilities play a critical role in the smooth operation of our financial markets. It's important that the Reserve Bank has the powers that it needs to move decisively to resolve, if needed, a crisis at a clearing and settlement facility. Any unmitigated crisis at a clearing and settlement facility could rapidly spread across the financial sector and into other areas of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that, I was astounded that the member for Forde, who is generally sensible on matters concerning financial markets regulation, has vowed to fight tooth and nail against the passage of this bill, a bill which empowers the RBA to deal with a crisis in our equities market, particularly in relation to clearing and settlement facilities. The bill does empower the RBA to, amongst other things in the event of a crisis, appoint a statutory manager to take control of domestic clearing and settlement facilities, transfer the business or shares to a third party and issue binding directions. In certain circumstances, these powers can also be used in relation to related bodies corporate of a domestic clearing and settlement facility. The bill also empowers the RBA to assist a foreign regulator to resolve a crisis in an overseas clearing and settlement facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill strengthens the regulatory powers of ASIC and the RBA in relation to financial markets infrastructure, giving them further powers to monitor, mitigate and reduce risks. Stronger day-to-day regulatory powers will help the regulators to take necessary action to mitigate risk and head off a crisis before it happens. I repeat that: to head off a crisis before it happens. Against that background, it beggars belief that somebody who wants to be the Treasurer of Australia and somebody who wants to sit on the front bench of an alternative government would vow to block the passage of this legislation. If your party espouses the principles of sound financial and economic management, it seems to me that this is rudimentary housekeeping business that any sensible government would want to do. Indeed, the Council of Financial Regulators has recommended these changes to the government and asked that we pass them as a matter of priority, and we will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with schedule 4 of the bill, which seems to have sent a wave of excitement, if not understanding, across members of the coalition parties. It deals with provisions for corporate climate risk disclosure. I just want to read a quote about the importance of this:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To maintain Australia's place in the global economy, the group considers it's essential there is a climate reporting framework that incentivises high quality, useful and internationally aligned climate-related disclosures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to read that again:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many members of this House, after listening to the febrile contributions from the member for Page and the member for Hume, might be asking themselves: Who is this group that is recommending and saying that it is absolutely essential that we introduce this framework as proposed by the government? Could it be the International Socialist Network? Could it be the Australian Greens, whose leader has had a fair bit to say in this House and elsewhere over the last 24 hours? Could it be the Trotskyist internationals advocating such, according to the member for Page, 'a radical, left-wing, extremist Communist proposition'? It must be, given what we've heard from members opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'm delighted to inform the House that this group is the peak bodies of 15 organisations, which include the Business Council of Australia, that far left-wing group of businesses; the Financial Services Council; the Governance Institute, the Property Council of Australia—now there are a bunch of red-rag, left-wing extremists. The Property Council of Australia—if ever we've seen an extreme left-wing organisation, you'd have to include them in the brackets, wouldn't you? The Business Council of Australia and the Property Council of Australia are amongst the 15 peak organisations who are recommending these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very simple reason why they are recommending these changes is that all of the concerns that members opposite have expressed about what's going on in financial markets—decisions and questions that are being asked by operators within financial markets about the businesses that they are investing in—are happening right now, but they are happening in the absence of a set of clear understandings, standards and reporting mechanisms upon which everybody can agree and through which everybody can make investment decisions and their credit decisions. They're happening overseas; those standards exist overseas. They don't yet exist in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You ask why we're doing this and why the 15 business organisations have issued a press release saying that these standards are absolutely essential and the government's got it right. You ask why they support this proposition. It's quite simple: they want the rest of the world to buy Australian goods and they want the rest of the world to invest in Australian businesses. Any party that proclaims itself the party of business and sensible economic management would have to understand that and support those two propositions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we are introducing this. We're doing it in a graduated way that understands there is a difference between large listed entities and large private corporations and small ones. There are graduated entry points. There's been extensive consultation and discussion with business, including finance businesses and the production sector, before we brought these measures before parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make these points simply to inform those members of the House who might have been listening to the disingenuous, febrile contributions by those members opposite which speak to the dark imaginings of their minds. This bill has nothing to do with what they're talking about, and the bizarre consequences that they seek to excite members about have nothing to do with what is proposed and what will operate as a result of this legislation. I say that with confidence. You don't have to accept my word on this. You don't have to accept the words of the government on this. You don't have to accept the words of the investor community on this. Just accept the words of the peak business organisations throughout this country, who are saying to this government, to this parliament—not just to Labor but also to the coalition—'For gods sake, will you get on with it, because we need to join the rest of the world and ensure that our standards are internationally aligned. We want to do it because we want the rest of the world to buy our goods. We want to do it because we want capital markets internationally aligned to be investing in our businesses.' With that contribution, I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome this legislation, as outlined in my second reading speech my community and I are concerned that, as it currently stands, it includes a broad modified liability approach for the commencement of sustainability reporting for the first three years of the scheme. While the government argues that this is designed to ensure reporting entities, auditors and directors are allowed time to develop experience and practice to report in line with the required standards, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry found many experts had concerns regarding the inclusion of a three-year modified liability. In many instances, their concerns were tied to the fact that in Australia we already have high rates of corporate greenwashing, with at least one in two companies surveyed by the ACCC in 2023 having been found to be promoting concerning claims about their environmental credentials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The right for third parties and consumers to hold companies, businesses, governments and individuals to account for making false or misleading statements is crucial not only to our society's general health but specifically to the proper functioning of any market. At a time when urgent climate action is critical and consumers and communities are demanding faster action to regear our society towards a future-focused economy, it's essential entities are held to account for greenwashing and promoting false solutions to the climate crisis. We are so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to adopting this reporting framework. Many of the companies that will be covered by the proposed modified liability arrangements here in Australia are actually already working to them in other markets. At the same time, many have voluntarily been reporting on climate-related risks in Australia also. Beyond those two facts, the truth is that the government has been signalling that this reform was coming, and the entire economy has had sufficient notice of proposed reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For this legislation to be as effective as it can be, my community argues that it should include a higher standard for those companies that have already begun to report in this way, while allowing room for the development of competency among those businesses which may be stepping into this reporting model for the first time. We agree that some form of indemnity provisions would be appropriate given the scale of this reform, and transitional measures would encourage more fulsome reporting and proper understanding of the requirements by companies and directors. We agree that we need to get the balance right. But we also argue that we should go as far as fast as we can, as we are already so far behind other markets, and we should not excuse wanton abuse to date by building an escape hatch for those businesses who should know better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that I am proposing remove immunity relating to transition plans, while retaining the rest of the bill's modified liability plan. Transition plans are company-led initiatives which are based on company business models. The integrity of these plans is important for investors and capital allocation, and any information contained within them should be considered to be of the highest calibre. In the exposure draft of this legislation, the only statements covered by the three-year immunity from private litigant action were those made in the sustainability report about scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and scenario analysis. The exposure draft did not prevent third parties from taking action in relation to a company's transition plan, meaning it would have been open to third parties, including investors, to take action against a company for making misleading statements in relation to its climate transition plan. Following a period of public consultation on the exposure draft, the federal government made two amendments which significantly broadened the scope of the immunity provisions to include transition plans and any forward-looking statement made in a sustainability report during the first year of the regime. In doing so, the government strengthened the protection for entities against liability for greenwashing. I fear that has left many of us concerned that there are indeed businesses currently in our market making false claims, and they are being told they are getting extra time to tidy their house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of transition plans in the immunity provisions is a significant departure from both the proposals in the exposure draft and the general application of misleading and deceptive conduct provisions in the Corporations Act, the ASIC Act and the Australian Consumer Law. Given that any business already presenting these transition plans has developed a level of proficiency in their creation, they should not be able to tap into immunity from private litigation. I commend my amendments to the House and thank the minister and his team in advance for considering them seriously. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I rise in support of the amendments moved by the member for North Sydney. They are very much in keeping with amendments that I had also circulated around concerns for the provisions to allow a grace period per se, or an exemption from prosecution in relation to a failure to properly report or mistakes. We know greenwashing is a major problem. As the public becomes more and more aware of the importance of the corporate transition to net zero—reducing their emissions to sustainable levels and reducing the footprint of their supply chains—we need to ensure there is corporate accountability in this space and that major corporations and entities caught by this legislation are, in fact, doing what is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of these disclosure frameworks and requirements are already in place in a voluntary way and are the general expectation internationally. It's important for us to understand that Australia is not a first mover in this space. We are, in fact, behind similar jurisdictions in relation to this requirement of disclosure. So it would be wrong to think that corporate entities are somehow being caught by surprise by this requirement to properly assess and disclose their exposure to risk, especially in relation to their supply chains. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important for legislation to find the right balance between putting additional requirements on corporate Australia and acknowledging that for some this might have some transition issues. I understand there's already been negotiation with the government to extend the timelines in which some of the provisions will come into play for the different groups of corporate entities to allow them additional time. With that in mind, I don't see the necessity for a provision which gives a further grace period in relation to misreporting. I very much support that provision being taken out of this legislation.</span>

I don't doubt for a moment the genuineness of the sentiment which motivates them to bring these amendments to the House. Ultimately, these are questions of balance and judgement, and on balance and judgement we won't be supporting the amendments. Many of the factual contributions they've made are correct, and I don't cavil with those, but we've had to get the balance right.</span>

It's not as if that through the transition period there is no enforcement available. There is enforcement through ASIC in its function as the corporate regulator responsible for the enforcement of these and other provisions under the Corporations Law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise today, on 6 June, in support of Labor's Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024, Nature Positive (Environment Information Australia) Bill 2024 and Nature Positive (Environment Law Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. I mention the date of 6 June because, as all sensible people know, this is Queensland Day. I'm wearing a maroon tie today, and I'm sure my whip would note the maroon tie, because I think there was a game of rugby league last night that was apparently quite significant—but I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills introduce reforms that will build a nature-positive Australia. Before I go to the substance of the bills, I want to particularly thank Labor Environment Action Network, LEAN, volunteers from all around Australia for the great work that they have done to ensure that this legislation came to the chamber. I particularly call out their leader, Felicity Wade, and also, in Queensland, Peter Casey and his team of incredible volunteers who've done so much for the environment over the years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does 'nature positive' actually mean? The short answer is: repair and regeneration rather than decline and destruction. It means strengthening our ecosystems and all their component parts. It also means recognising our unique environment as a natural asset to be protected and strengthened—recognising the environment as an asset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to government two years ago, the Minister for the Environment and Water released the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report. This is a five-yearly report. It is a report card, if you will, on what is happening in the environment. It should've been handed down in December 2021, when the Morrison government was on this side of the chamber, but the former minister, the now deputy opposition leader, did not release the report. That was undoubtedly because the report card stated: must try harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't mean to be flippant, as the decade of environmental neglect from those opposite is definitely no laughing matter. The report said that the Australian environment was in very bad shape and was declining. To this day, it is sobering reading, a national catalogue of shame. The report said that Australia had lost more mammal species to extinction than had any other continent—and remember that most of our mammals are found on no other continent. The report card said that Australia has more foreign plant species than native species. The report described how land the size of Tasmania had been cleared. It's hard to imagine the scale of ecosystem destruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also noted that up to 80,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometre are littering our oceans and that the flow of Murray-Darling tributaries had reached record low levels. I say that as someone who grew up beside those rivers—besides the Balonne River.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How cowardly was it of the former minister not to release that report with that last election looming? The coalition, the party of climate change deniers, had spent their decade in office promising schemes they would never deliver, cutting funding and, yes, even notoriously laughing at the plight of Pacific island nations faced with rising sea levels. Do you remember that from the member from Dixon? He was standing under that boom mic laughing at the plight of our Pacific island family, our own neighbours. This subsequently spoiled relationships in our own backyard, making it more dangerous for the next generation of Australians and enabling other actors who are not necessarily intent on doing good to go into the Pacific region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition sabotaged the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, they ignored the Samuel review, they set recycling targets but didn't deliver, they reduced the size of marine parks and they cut funding to the department by 40 per cent. Is it any wonder they received an F—F for fail—on their report card. By the end of their time on the Treasury benches, the coalition had all the freshness and vitality of <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend at Bernie's II</span>. Now, in their third instalment, they've actually got Bernie running the show when it comes to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all that on their record, it's alarming that the Leader of the Opposition still wants to weaken our environmental laws and give the go-ahead to damaging projects like Clive Palmer's coalmine right beside the Great Barrier Reef. The only renewable resource that the coalition believes in is ignorance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see that, in May 2022, the Albanese Labor government had urgent work to do both to address the environmental vandalism and the related effects of a decade of neglect and to design measures to repair and regenerate our environment. Last year, we passed legislation that established the Nature Repair Market, which is a world first. We also enhanced our environmental laws to ensure that the minister must assess all unconventional gas projects that trigger the environmental legislation that the Commonwealth government is able to implement. Remember, we are bound by that thing called the Constitution in terms of what we can make environmental laws about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature protection suite of bills is the second stage of our plan, and I'm proud to be talking about them today. This second stage of reform focuses on stronger environmental powers, faster environmental approvals, more information about the environment and greater transparency. The legislation is good for the environment, good for the people of Australia and good for business. We're fixing laws so that they are less bureaucratic and provide more certainty for business. However, the key focus remains on repairing our environment. It is important that we let businesses know what they can and can't do, because most businesses, if they get certainty about a decision early, can move on and do more positive things. But, as I said, the key focus remains on repairing the environment, protecting our unique flora and fauna and preventing extinctions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently hosted a community forum with the Wilderness Society in my electorate. From the discussions at that gathering, I know that this is what my constituents and all Australians want. We all value our environment and we're proud of its uniqueness. Australians expect Labor to look after the environment, and that's what we're delivering with our Nature Positive Plan. No government has done more for the environment and climate than the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an election promise to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency, to be called Environment Protection Australia, or the EPA. The minister describes it as 'a tough cop on the beat'. This agency will be strong, national and impartial and will ensure compliance with environmental laws to better protect the environment and, as I mentioned earlier, make faster decisions. It's important to note that the EPA will be enshrined in legislation as an independent statutory authority, giving it that arms-length protection. It will be separate from the department and the government and will have its own chief executive officer and commensurate budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's crucial that we establish the EPA as soon as possible. It will enable a smoother process during the transition of responsibilities from the department to the agency. And we need it up and running before it is tasked with implementing our new environmental laws. The EPA will implement and integrate environmental data collection. We need to have meaningful, consistent and reliable data to make evidence based decisions that will support our drive to protect 30 per cent of our land and oceans by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that community forum, I was shocked to see how much land is still being cleared in Queensland that does not reach the trigger point for the EPBC Act. I see my next-door neighbour nodding in agreement. It is a concern that people are able to do broadscale tree clearing in significant old-growth parts of Queensland and they do not have to consider all the koalas and other things that are in that environment. That's something that we need to work on with our state counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The EPA will also have the responsibility of fixing the current regulatory system, which everyone agrees has major flaws. Its decisions will uphold regulations and be transparent, accountable, efficient and focused on nature positive outcomes. I'm sure that the National Party, with its new-found enthusiasm for ensuring that no trees are cleared for solar panels or wind farms, will also embrace the idea that nature is protected for the inherent benefit of that asset rather than just for the anti-renewable jihad that they're on at the moment. The idea that you can have somebody riding around tilting at windmills—I can just see the member for New England on his old donkey, tilting at the windmills, saying: 'We must stop it. We must stop these dragons from taking hold of our landscape.' It's bizarre to think that that line of argument is occurring in 2024. So the EPA is going to have a big responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want the EPA to be something Australians have faith in and are proud of. The EPA will be a truly national regulatory body, responsible for issues that affect us all, from recycling and waste exports to hazardous waste, dumping at sea, the wildlife trade, improving air quality and protecting the ozone and underwater cultural heritage. That's a wide range of responsibilities, and they are all necessary to repair and regenerate our environment. Having a tough cop on the beat is crucial when you consider that the Samuel review found that the regulator is not fulfilling this function. This was backed up by a government audit which found that one in seven projects using environmental offsets under current legislation had either obviously or potentially breached their approval conditions. An additional audit indicated that one in four projects had potentially failed to secure enough environmental credits to offset the impact their project was having on the environment. This unacceptable situation must stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Samuel review also showed that serious enforcement action is seldom implemented, and recommended that penalties need to be stronger—not just the cost of doing business. That's why this legislation increases the penalty for a serious breach of federal environmental law, up to $780 million in some circumstances. The EPA's strong new regulatory powers to monitor and enforce compliance are a key part of the generating trust in the new body. If an organisation does not mitigate against environmental damage or commit to an offset then Australians deserve to trust that the EPA will ensure there are serious consequences. The EPA will use high-quality data to deliver proportionate and effective compliance and enforcement decisions to the minority of businesses who intend on doing the wrong thing. The EPA will also have the power to enforce a stop-work order in urgent circumstances where the risk to the environment is both significant and imminent. This will reassure Australians that environmental protection outcomes are a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect of the work of the EPA will be to advise the minister in government. They'll be able to make decisions as required, but, in practice, decisions will be made on the advice of the EPA. The EPA will also be required to provide feedback on improvements to environmental laws. They will work closely with the head of Environment Information Australia—the ABS for the bush—which is a position that will be established through these reforms. The head of Environment Information Australia will be an independent position with the legislative mandate to provide transparent information and environmental data to the EPA, to the minister and to the public. Environment Information Australia will work with scientists, First Nations people and other experts to collect information and to produce reliable and consistent tracking information on the state of the environment. This will enable the EPA and state and territory governments to have better access to reliable data for planning and decision-making. Good data is the foundation of driving a nature-positive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This data will be used not only by governments but also to provide evidence for investment and for policy and regulatory decisions by the private sector, by community groups, by academics, by scientists and by philanthropic groups who are doing great work in revegetation. One example of the use of better data is choosing better sites for development which minimise the impact on their environment and high-value habitats. When a minimal impact site is chosen, projects are able to be approved more quickly and more easily.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have mentioned the word 'independent' multiple times in this speech; that's by design, because the EPA is all about ensuring independence in reporting. This means that no more Australian governments can hide the truth about the state of the environment and hold it over to a more politically convenient time. The stakes are too high for political games. The reports will come out every two years—not five—under this legislation. We know that there's more work to be done, and I am hoping that the opposition, the Greens, the Independents, the Teals and all the crossbench engage with us on these reforms in good faith. There's too much at stake. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills respond to the Samuel review and our own audits, and set us up for the next stage of our complex environmental law reforms. We have chosen to protect our environment. We have the opportunity to repair and replenish. I urge all MPs to look at the benefits of the strong EPA; to say yes to tougher penalties for those breaking environmental laws; to say yes to better data to inform future planning and decision-making; to say yes to defining what it means to be nature positive in law; and to say yes to more programs, projects, policies and actions to create a nature-positive Australia. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

I had the pleasure of attending their 30th birthday celebration recently—and not one of them forgot who I was!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jokes aside, I congratulate Janet, Margaret and the social committees on their efforts in ensuring those who are in their later years of their lives have events to look forward to. They have physical and social activities which include exercise programs, health talks, craft activities, theatre groups and card games. Most important are the information technology sessions available to them, to stay connected with their family and friends. Groups like Mackay over-50s-and-better might seem simple from the outside, but the work they do to ensure the vulnerable older members of our community don't experience social isolation is invaluable. They always celebrate in style, with dress-up events and decorations to make every event a fantastic get-together.</span>

The food was delicious, the conversations were robust and the entertainment was second to none. Happy birthday, and I look forward to attending many more of your birthday events. Congratulations, and keep up the good work.</span>

After 22 failed energy policies, they want us to believe that nuclear is the answer and that this is a credible position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent report by the CSIRO concluded that nuclear power cannot be delivered before 2040. Combine that with the fact that 90 per cent of Australia's coal power will close by 2035, and it is clear those opposite would see Australians sitting in the dark for five years before nuclear is connected to the grid. What might it deliver? Higher bills for Australian households and businesses. Both the CSIRO and AEMO have concluded that nuclear energy is the most expensive form of energy, costing up to eight times more than firmed renewables.</span>

They've refused to detail in whose backyard these nuclear plants will go. Unlike those opposite, this government is getting on with delivering cheaper and cleaner renewable energy for Australians. Unlike those opposite, the Albanese government has a plan to fix the mess that was left behind in our energy system.</span>

Beenleigh came together as a community on Saturday 11 May to commemorate our century-old-and-then-some cane traditions. Usually I'm behind the microphone and on the judging panel, but this time I joined my team with our float going around the parade route, and it was great to catch up with so many local people and have a chat along the way around.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the festival made its much-anticipated return in 2021, the Beenleigh cane festival and gala ball has become one of the biggest events in the Logan City calendar. Colourful floats, marching bands and local groups showcased the rich heritage and spirit of our community, and it was a terrific, spectacular day. It says everything wonderful about our special part of the world that so many members of our community came out to be part of the parade and celebrate the rich history and tradition of the Beenleigh area. But it's also great for the newer members of our community to see and celebrate and be part of celebrating that rich tradition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I want to thank the Rotary Club of Beenleigh for the enormous amount of work they do each and every year to make these events happen. They need to be congratulated for the tireless work they did in organising and running the event. I am looking forward to the 2025 Beenleigh cane festival and parade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to know where Peter Dutton would like to put the nuclear reactors in our wide brown land. Yes, we do have a lot of land and we do have a lot of sunshine, so it makes absolute sense to say, as most Australians will say to you, 'I completely back renewables.' When you talk to them about nuclear and you say, 'Well, where do you think those reactors should go? Do you think they should go in the Hunter?' people say, 'No, Mez, I don't think that's the best fit.' 'What about Tomaree Headland in Port Stephens, a beautiful place with plenty of water around there? Perhaps Mr Dutton might want to put a nuclear reactor there.' 'No, hang on.' They're not so keen on that. People do have some legitimate concerns about wind turbines off our coast, and I understand that, and our government has been working with them on that. I'm really proud of the way my community has worked with me, and I thank them for that. But, when I talk to them about nuclear, they are definite that they do not want it. What they do want is a government like ours that is prepared to take the decisions, lay out the plan and have the policy backup. We're going to keep the lights on, and we're not going to make it reactionary.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Since becoming North Sydney's MP, I have learned a lot about the myriad of small communities that make the electorate of North Sydney such a rewarding and enriching place to live. One thing that has consistently stood out is how much education is valued and how fortunate we are to have so many wonderful schools in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'd like to make special mention of an important milestone for just one of our celebrated educational communities, that being the 90th anniversary of Willoughby Girls High School, the only comprehensive government girls school in the Lower North Shore of Sydney. Since 1934, this community, including principals, staff and parents, has nurtured, educated and inspired thousands of young women under the motto 'Courage, truth and loyalty'. These women include the highly respected and renowned Evonne Goolagong, Justice Ruth McColl of the Court of Appeal, and the legendary June Dally-Watkins. In addition to its widely acknowledged and celebrated high academic achievement, Willoughby Girls High School is proud of its diverse student body. I wholeheartedly congratulate principal Ms Adrienne Scalese, the teachers, and the P&amp;C, who all work incredibly hard to support the school and help so many young women to reach their potential and enrich their communities in a variety of ways. The celebration last Saturday was no exception. I very much enjoyed meeting so many of both the current and past students and standing alongside incredible community leaders, department representatives, family and friends to mark this memorable occasion. I hope the best years for Willoughby Girls High School are yet to come.</span>

The following Australian towns and regions may be renamed 'Springfield' and play host to a nuclear power plant: Gladstone, Newcastle, Gippsland, Barossa Valley, Collie, Anglesey, Bribie Island, the Whitsundays and Jervis Bay. I'm certain that residents and members will be glowing with anticipation. Welcome to the coalition's world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Simpsons</span> economics, where a nuclear power plant can just magically appear, is fantastically cheap to build and quick to get operational, and will have no other issues associated with it. What we know is that for at least 12 weeks, if not longer, the Leader of the Opposition has known exactly where he would locate his nuclear reactors, but he's been having some trouble telling the Australian people exactly where they would be. He's obviously concerned about the fallout. At least Mr Burns had the decency to be transparent with his evil plans. Those opposite may have gotten away with secret ministries, but I very much doubt they will get away with secret power plants. As I said last week, while this government is committed to a renewable future made in Australia, the opposition are committed to a future made in fiction.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Yesterday we saw Labor and the Liberals unite to defend the State of Israel as it carries out a genocide. Labor and the Liberals are on a unity ticket when it comes to supporting Israel's invasion of Gaza. They can come together to condemn the Greens, but where's the action against Israel's genocide? Over 35,000 Palestinians have been murdered, children have been burned alive and babies have been dying in their mothers' arms as they're starved to death by the State of Israel. And what does Labor do? Well, for 48 days they stop UNRWA funding. In February this year, Labor signed a $917 million contract with Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems. That's the company that made the drones that murdered the Australian aid worker. Labor authorises the export of parts for the F-35 jets that are used in Israel. That is complicity in genocide.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than getting angry about being called out and joining with the Liberals in a major-party alliance, how about Labor members in this place take some responsibility? Labor is in government. It could ban two-way arms trade with Israel, but it won't. It could expel the Israeli ambassador, but it won't. Labor can't even recognise the state of Palestine, when 143 countries around the world already have. Even thousands of public servants in the federal Public Service are calling on the Australian government to cease military trade with Israel, lest they be complicit in genocide. This is a government full of cowards and sellouts, and you should all hang your heads in shame.</span>

But where are the details? At this stage it's just a nuclear fantasy that is costly, half-baked yellow cake and ill informed. It's a fantasy that experts say is impossible before 2040 and would cost up to eight times more than renewables. Unlike the coalition, we have a plan to tackle climate change with clean, reliable energy that will reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that people in my region want to know is: will there be a risky reactor on the Surf Coast? The question is credible because the only thing we do know about the coalition's thought bubble is that these nuclear reactors would be located in disused coalmines. I can tell you the people of Anglesea on the Great Ocean Road fought passionately to get rid of the Alcoa coalmine. They certainly did not do this to make way for a nuclear reactor. While the member for Wannon has denied that Anglesea is a potential site, we are yet to officially hear this from the Leader of the Opposition. I urge the opposition leader to come clean and declare where his reactors will be located.

If you go onto their website, ramint.gov.au, it shows where they are, including eight locations in Victoria.</span>

But for me it's 'Sleepytime'. For many of us in this building and for those who work away from family, you know what it's like to not be with your children quite regularly. I like this quote said to Bingo: 'Remember, I'll always be here for you, even if you can't see me, because I love you.' In that, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bluey</span> captured something we all know well—that night-time is important for children and families, and, in those moments when we're not together we're still there and we still love them. And we love you, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bluey</span>.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  If you've been reading some of the self-propelled commentary about Josh Frydenberg lately, you might be forgiven for thinking that he is the Liberal Party's chosen one. Just like Anakin Skywalker, Josh was prophesied to be the hero of our time. It was said that he would destroy inflation, not raise it, and bring balance to the budget, not leave it in deficit. Yet that's exactly what he left us: spiking inflation and $1 trillion of Liberal debt with nothing to show for it. Here we are, two years on, with a new hope. Balance has been restored, unemployment is down and real wages are growing, but the Liberals want to take us back to the prequels, back to when we had higher inflation, higher taxes and higher hopes for Josh Frydenberg.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These days, Josh is more of a phantom menace. One second he's fuelling speculation of a return to politics; the next he is but a humble investment banker. The Australian people are not tempted by this dark side. While the Liberals opposite reminisce about the glory days of the Scott Morrison empire—we might remember it was when a dark overlord overthrew his former master and consolidated power from the shadows—the Albanese government is getting on with delivering real wage growth and lower taxes for every single Australian.</span>

They do this without ever asking for anything in return. So, once a year, at the brigades' annual dinners, we have a special opportunity to reflect on the achievements of our volunteers and on the sacrifices they make. In the past month, I've had the honour of attending the Mooroolbark and Lilydale CFA dinners.</span>

It's pure fantasy to believe that our country, with its natural resources of solar, hydro and wind, needs or can handle nuclear energy. But we shouldn't forget that it was a previous coalition government that tried to dump a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the role of nuclear energy in producing nuclear isotopes for medicine and the great things that it can do, but a nuclear power industry in Australia will come too late, will be too expensive and will come with side effects, like dealing with nuclear waste, that we can ill afford dealing with. If you go to the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor now, you will see warehouses full of nuclear waste that they can't get rid of. What are we going to do if, in 10 or 20 years time, we have more nuclear power stations? It's an absolute joke, a complete fantasy. I just cannot understand why the coalition is persisting with it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians of all ages want us to ensure that they keep their lights on by using renewable power sources. Under the coalition government, over 20 coal plants were closed but weren't replaced. We need to do more with renewables. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We were protesting federal agricultural minister Watt's introduction only the day before of the enabling legislation to phase out live sheep exports. The atmosphere was buoyant as farmers, livestock transporters, shearers, feed producers and rural families united under the banner of 'Keep the Sheep'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ben Sutherland, vice-president of the Livestock and Rural Transporters Association of WA, let me ride in his 600-horsepower B-double, aptly named The Last Straw. Benno had travelled 500 kilometres to muster and lead the convoys through the major arteries of Perth. There were kids in pyjamas cheering from the sidewalks and commuters honking their horns in support, and the police were impressed at our convoy management. I want to congratulate all of the organising committee on a great day out.</span>

We won't be dictated to by Canberra, so, if we can't overturn this bad Labor policy, it's time to overturn the Labor government and keep the sheep.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  All the evidence, all the expertise and all the inquiries have made it crystal clear there's no case for nuclear energy in Australia. With each passing year, renewables and storage get cheaper and more efficient, and yet nuclear takes longer and becomes more expensive. This is a 70-year-old technology with enormous decommissioning costs and no technical solution for the permanent storage of nuclear waste. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition is having a laugh when he claims the nuclear industry is going strong elsewhere. The truth is that nuclear peaked as a share of global energy back in 1996. Today it is half that. The number of reactors peaked in 2002. In France, nuclear generation in 2022 was less than in 1990. In the US, nuclear has hit a 25-year low. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only France, South Korea and Russia build reactors overseas, and the French company EDF was renationalised last year on the brink of bankruptcy. In 2022, the Korean state owned utility booked a record $25 billion loss. Last year, the world added 348 gigawatts of renewable energy, but only four gigawatts of nuclear energy. Sadly, last August, Japan commenced a 30-year program of discharging contaminated water from Fukushima into the Pacific Ocean. There are still 27,000 people displaced in Japan, and the clean-up cost is listed at US$223 billion. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I've always actively reached out to the community of McPherson to listen to and best understand their concerns and feedback. Today I'd like to report to the House the top issues that are being raised with me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me start with transport. The widening of the M1 is well supported, but the work needs to be completed sooner. The light rail remains contentious, with an increasing number of people opposing further extensions beyond the current stage 3 to Burleigh. There's overwhelming support for the extension of heavy rail south from Varsity Lakes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there is development—and specifically overdevelopment—along the Gold Coast Highway. Residents are concerned not just about the disruption to their way of life that high-density housing brings but also that the developments are not providing the affordable housing that is so desperately needed right across the Gold Coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there is crime. Not a day goes by when there aren't concerns raised by residents about houses being broken into, cars being stolen and people feeling unsafe at shopping centres, walking their dogs and in their own homes. Often these crimes are fuelled by drugs. The criminals are high on drugs or they need money to buy more drugs. Clearly, more work needs to be done at our borders, and this means more support for the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth is the cost of living. Rising prices are hurting absolutely everyone, from young people trying to get ahead to older members of our community who are struggling to pay their rent, let alone their electricity, food and transport costs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  If this round of media backgrounding can be believed, we are only days away from the Leader of the Opposition announcing his big policy glow-up on nuclear energy. We've heard this one before, 674 days ago, and we have heard nothing but excuses as to why the dog ate their homework and all of the details. We thought that they would release it around the time of the budget, but they left us in the dark yet again. A policy matching its subject perfectly—something that will cost more and take significantly longer to deliver than what they promised at the start. It's just like Malcolm Turnbull's NBN, 'It will be faster, cheaper and more affordable.' We've heard that one before, right? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But good news, everyone. The vault door is finally going to come off, and we can finally behold it in all of its splendour—the big power trip; more accurately, a power fumble from those opposite. You really must wonder why it has taken so long to release a policy. It isn't as if they have scientists working on it. They're all woke because they resoundingly give nuclear power in Australia a big fail, along with the attempts of those opposite to make it happen. Sunlight can be the biggest disinfectant and also a great form of renewable energy. In this case, I hope it illuminates us all regarding how far they are willing to go to avoid a renewable energy future for Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just lastly, regarding the proposal around the Barossa Valley. Seriously, the member for Barker came in here the other day worrying about the wine export market. How the hell do we sell glow-in-the-dark wine products? What a joke.</span>

These three hardworking athletes, Sophie Hills, Bella Shaw and Abbie King, being just 17, 16 and 15 years old respectively, have already achieved a swag of wins between them and all three rank in the top 10 in Australia for their ages in several events. Their coach, Ketrina Clarke, said this will be their first opportunity to experience open competition at an Olympic trial and they're exited about the opportunity to compete alongside some of the best swimmers in the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sophie Hills is Swimming Tasmania's current multiclass champion, holding several S9 state records, and dominated her class at the Tasmania sprint and long course championships, earning 12 individual gold medals. Abbie King won 10 individuals golds and is the Tasmanian age champion in individual medley, butterfly and freestyle. Bella Shaw achieved two national qualifying times and won six backstroke gold medals. The girls have all shown great dedication to their chosen sport and worked very hard.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations go also to their coach and the South Esk club, who guide and support them. I give a shout-out also to their parents and families, who do so much to support their dedication, with many mornings, late nights and long drives to training. Good luck with the next challenge, girls. We wish you every success in Brisbane and beyond.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  The Leader of the Opposition, 674 days ago, announced his plans for a nuclear powered Australia. That's a really long time to have no detail, no sites, no costs and no plan. To put that amount of time in context, I thought I'd do a little web search and see what else it would take 674 days to go. Get this. It took 210 days for Jessica Watson to circumnavigate the world in her yacht. In 674 days, she could have done it three times and still had two weeks to spare. So it takes 210 days to circumnavigate the world, but the Leader of the Opposition can't even circumnavigate his own party room in 674 days. Pat Farmer is a great Australian. How long do you think he took to run around Australia? A thousand days? Eight hundred days? It was only 191 days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Pat Farmer can run around Australia, the Liberals are giving us the run-around. Their nuclear delusion is just another attempt to derail our transition to a net zero economy. In those same 674 days, Labor have boosted renewables in our grid by 25 per cent and we have cut emissions from the energy market to all-time lows. Labor is getting on with the job of decarbonising our economy while the Liberals are in a nuclear la-la land. It's time to put up or shut up on their nuclear fantasy once and for all.</span>

The most important job of the Prime Minister is to keep Australians safe and he has failed to do so, with devastating consequences for our community. The boats keep coming and the borders are not secure under this government.

There's $27 billion for 36,000 new public servants and $600,000 for a speechwriter, and that's just the latest. Don't forget the almost $500 million on a failed referendum. This is waste from this government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to inform the House that the Governor-General, David Hurley, and Mrs Hurley are in France representing Australia at the commemorations, and I spoke to them yesterday. Indeed, this is a remarkable occasion where many former veterans as well, not just from Australia but from the Allied forces, are gathering today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">D-Day was an unprecedented feat of collective willpower and daring—the free world's decisive reply to the poison of Nazi tyranny. It rightly holds a place in our collective hearts as one of the most extraordinary turning points in global history—and it turned on the courage of nearly 160,000 soldiers, sailors, aircrew and medics on that first day alone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cinema has given a sense of how it looked. Yet what will always remain elusive to us is how it truly felt: the chaos; the noise; the desperation; and, yes, the fear; yet also the determination; the camaraderie; the overwhelming sense of purpose. From that fierce cauldron of heroism and sacrifice would flow a force that ultimately swept half a continent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among all the British, Canadians and Americans, our tendency is not to think of D-Day as a story with masses of Australian voices. So many Australians were, of course, defending us much closer to home by then. Yet there were 3,300 Australians serving on D-Day, and they acquitted themselves as bravely and nobly as in any theatre of war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was even an original Anzac among them: George Dixon, a Tasmanian who was wounded at Gallipoli after managing to enlist—showing some creativity—aged just 15. Think about that. So he was no stranger to fateful shores when, decades later, he took charge of one of the Canadian tank-landing craft at Juno Beach. His story is just one of the thousands of those who were there at the beginning of this most extraordinary mission, this headlong drive to lift Europe out of the darkness into which it had been plunged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eight decades on, we are reminded tragically often that peace is far from a foregone conclusion. Yet, as we remember D-Day, we are also reminded about one of the most important truths: peace is always worth fighting for. On those French beaches eighty years ago, that is the great light those courageous thousands held up for the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his fine words, and I join him in commemorating this 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings. There were many turning points in the Second World War: Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, Stalingrad, Midway, El Alamein—to name but a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this day, historians have different opinions about what events marked the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end, but one thing is certain: victory against the German war machine, the defeat of Nazi tyranny and the liberation of Europe would not have been possible without Operation Neptune, the Normandy landings; and Operation Overlord, the Battle of Normandy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">D-Day, 6 June 1944, was the day of days. Winston Churchill said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He described it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Churchill said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thank God, we enter upon it with our great Allies all in good heart and all in good friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What can be forgotten is that Operation Overlord was years in the making. Supreme commander General Dwight D Eisenhower said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This operation is planned as a victory, and that's the way it's going to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, no effort was spared in planning, arms buildup, training, secrecy and one of the most sophisticated deception operations in military history: Operation Fortitude. Hitler kept some of his best forces in Norway and around Calais and awaited an allied invasion that would never come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">D-Day saw a combination of night-time airborne drops behind enemy lines to secure key crossroads, causeways and bridges; pre-assault bombardments of the German defensive positions; and five beach landings. By the end of the day, more than 155,000 Allied troops had secured a foothold in Normandy, from which they would go on to win the war in Europe. But the first day of the great crusade, as Eisenhower called it, came at a terrible cost, with more than 4,400 Allied troops killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, it's our honour as a nation, it's our privilege as a parliament, to acknowledge, to commemorate and to pay tribute to the 3,200 Australians who were involved in D-Day, including the 13 Australians who were killed. By extension, we pay homage to the thousands more Australians who helped to liberate Europe from tyranny following D-Day and the hundreds killed over the course of the campaign. Those who served and sacrificed in the Second World War were truly the Greatest Generation. So many young men set aside their futures to ensure the future and freedom of others. On the Normandy beaches, some didn't make it one foot out of their landing craft. In the skies above Normandy, some didn't make it out of their aircraft. So many more fought and fell on European soil in the days and months that followed. Others made it all the way from D-Day to VE Day, returning home from the horror of war to find what peace they could, each in their own way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this 80th anniversary of D-Day, we are reminded that democracy and freedom are the result of neither luck nor natural occurrence. We are the beneficiaries and custodians of the great inheritance of democracy and freedom, which the Greatest Generation defended and preserved through their service and their sacrifice. Our gratitude to them must never wane. Our duty to them is to never drift into complacency when peace is threatened in our times. Our memory of them must never fade. Their lives and endeavours are a reminder of the commitment needed to repel tyranny, of the courage needed to preserve liberty. May they continue to be an inspiration, to our generation and those that follow us, of the importance of such commitment and courage. Lest we forget.</span>

Last weekend, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, I met with Lloyd Austin, the United States Secretary of Defense, and I remarked to Lloyd that, in the last two years, of all my counterparts he is easily the one with whom I have met the most. At one level that's unsurprising, given the significance to Australia of America as our ally. But, when you consider that I would be just one of many defence ministers around the world who would make the same observation, it says a lot about America's continuing presence, about the remarkable role which Lloyd Austin is personally playing and about the impressive way in which the Biden administration is managing America's place in the world. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the most momentous day in the entire history of human warfare. On that day, Australians and Americans stood side-by-side, as we have in every conflict since the First World War. In April 1945 we also stood side-by-side as Australia sent a delegation, led by Frank Forde and Doc Evatt, to the peace conference in San Francisco which established the United Nations. Having endured the greatest calamity ever, this meeting—one of the most important meetings of all time—was underpinned by an abiding commitment that, in the future, disputes between nations should be resolved not by reference to might and power but by reference to a set of rules: the global rules based order. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, as we have stood with America in conflict so too we have stood with them and others as guardians and protectors of this global rules based order. In Singapore on the weekend this was the topic, because the global rules based order today is under more pressure than it has been at any point since the end of the Second World War. In all our meetings with the United States, with our partners in ASEAN, with Japan and Korea, with our friends in NATO and with China as well our message was clear and simple: the global rules based order remains today, as it was imagined in 1945, the greatest hope for enduring human security, because the global rules based order provides full sovereignty to all nations, large and small, not just great powers. The global rules based order is at the heart of Australia's strategic interests, and the maintenance of this order must continue to be the single most important contribution that all of us make to global peace.</span>

The member for Corangamite understands how important it is that we give a tax cut to every taxpayer in her community and right around the country and that we provide energy bill relief to every household in her electorate and right around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The national accounts yesterday were confirmation that the economy is soft and that people are under pressure. We saw it in the savings numbers. We saw it in the consumption figures. We saw it in the impact of rents and rate rises on our economy and on household budgets. These are the conditions that we anticipated in the budget because we don't just acknowledge and understand that times are tough for too many people; we're actually doing something about it in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary way that we're doing that is with our cost-of-living relief: our tax cut for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper medicines, getting wages moving again and our help with rent and with student debt. At the same time, we're making really important investments in housing, in skills and in the industries which will power the future in the context of the global net zero transformation—all at the same time as we repair the budget. We turn big Liberal deficits into Labor surpluses and pay down the debt that we inherited from those opposite when we came to office. Our approach is responsible. It is methodical, it is considered, and it is calibrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We reject a lot of the free advice that we got around budget time—that we should have slashed and burned in the budget, when the economy was already weak and when people were already under enough pressure. We reject as well the chaotic and catastrophic approach which was pitched up by those opposite. We know that they didn't want everyone to get a tax cut, because they called for an election over it. We know that they don't want people to get energy bill relief, because last time they voted against it. They described the indexation of the age pension as 'overspending' in the budget. They called for the type of slashing and burning in the budget which would have smashed the economy and left people to fend for themselves at a time of extreme pressure. They have proven again and again—before, during and after the budget reply—that their nasty negativity is no substitute for economic credibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these difficult circumstances, the best thing to do is to provide cost-of-living relief in the most responsible way, invest in housing, skills and industry, and repair the budget without smashing the economy. That's what our budget is all about. The national accounts showed again why that's so important and why the approach that we are taking in the budget and in our economic strategy is exactly right for the challenging circumstances that we all confront.</span>

This year, Labor awarded a $917 million contract to Israeli weapons corporation Elbit Systems, the same company that made the drone that Israel used to bomb the World Central Kitchen convoy and kill Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom. Elbit is one of the largest suppliers to the Israeli military as it carries out a genocide in Gaza. Elbit Systems is already blacklisted in other countries for violations of humanitarian law. Why won't the government cancel the Elbit Systems contract?</span>

It is a fact that there have been no weapons or ammunition exported to Israel in the last five years. That information was confirmed in Senate estimates. Just this week, Defence officials confirmed that recent data published by DFAT referring to the export of arms to Israel in February refers to the export of a single item for the Australian Defence Force that will return to Australia once it's fixed, disproving the misinformation being peddled by you. At that time, it is a fact that defence export permits that were issued to Israel over the last five years were for items other than weapons and ammunition, such as components of ADF equipment which was being repaired.</span>

Australia is one of 18 like-minded nations, including Norway, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands, who operate the F-35 and contribute to its global supply chain. They know that that is the case as well, but they seek, in a divisive way, to raise these issues in order to then weaponise them and cause division in the Australian community.

Two years ago, the member for Chisholm promised her community that we would make medicines cheaper, and over the past two years we've been busy delivering on that promise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just the first three months of government, we slashed the maximum amount that millions of pensioners would pay for their medicines across a given year by 25 per cent. In the first 12 months, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, a cut that saves general patients more than $20 million each and every month. In our first 18 months, we finally allowed doctors to prescribe common medicines for chronic disease for 60 days rather than just 30, saving patients lots of time and even more money. And, in our first 24 months, we've made more than 200 new and amended listings to the PBS, giving Australian patients access to the world's best treatments at affordable PBS prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those listings include three high-cost listings included in the Treasurer's budget last month, like Camzyos, which is a new treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition that thickens the heart muscle and blocks blood flow, causing chest pains, shortness of breath and swelling right through the body. One patient, Dionne, told us that this condition made it impossible for her to exercise and made it a struggle even to take her dog for a walk. But, after taking Camzyos, Dionne told us, 'I've got my life back.' After the Treasurer's listing, almost 4,000 patients every year will get their life back. Instead of paying $30,000 for this treatment, they'll just pay PBS prices. PBS prices under this budget, as well, will be frozen for up to five years, as part of the agreement that I signed earlier this week with the Pharmacy Guild and in legislation that I introduced into the House of Representatives this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest cheaper-medicines measure alone will save patients almost half a billion dollars in co-payments over the next five years. And we know on this side that cheaper medicines are good not just for the hip pocket—although they obviously are—but also for your health, because they make it much more likely that people will take the medicines they need. That is why it's so hard to comprehend how the Leader of the Opposition can justify trying to jack up the price of medicines by up to $5 a script in his horror health budget he delivered 10 years ago, almost to the day. The Leader of the Opposition tried to make medicines dearer. We're busy making them cheaper.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, we don't want to get that heavily rehearsed pointy finger again from the shadow Treasurer! The point that I'm making is: if the shadow Treasurer is angry about inflation with a '3' in front of it, he must be filthy about inflation with a '6' in front of it, which is what we inherited from those opposite. If he wants to talk about managing the budget, he should be honest enough to tell the Australian people from the dispatch box that the cumulative bottom lines in the budget are $215 billion better as a consequence of our economic management. And he should tell the Australian people about the $80 billion of debt interest that we're avoiding because we're paying down the Liberal debt we inherited. And he should be honest and say that inflation now is almost half what we inherited when he was a cabinet minister in the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are under no illusions about the conditions in the economy right now. We've been very upfront about the weakness in the economy, the softness in the economy, laid bare by yesterday's national accounts. We know that people are under pressure as well. But more than acknowledging that, more than understanding that, we're acting on it, and we're acting on it despite the kind of nasty negativity and reflexive opposition we hear from those opposite. I mean, if those opposite were fair dinkum, they'd come to the dispatch box and they'd say to all those millions of Australians who are getting a tax cut because of us that they'd rather people didn't get it. And they'd come to the dispatch box and say they don't think people should get energy bill relief or help with their rent or cheaper medicines and all the other things they opposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the point that I made, and I come back very specifically to the question the shadow Treasurer asked, is that if you factor in the conditions that exist in the economy right now—in the national economy and indeed in household budgets as well—the approach that we're taking is very important, and it is calibrated for the conditions people are facing and the cost-of living pressures and other pressures they're under. Our responsible economic management is getting the budget in better nick, providing cost-of-living help and investing in the future—all the things they failed to do when they were in government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Indeed, we are taking action on the cost-of-living, because that is our No. 1 priority, and the recent budget showed that. I'm glad that we get some questions about the economy, and the budget, of course, which is the focus on this side of the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July, in less than a month now, there will be lower taxes for every single Australian taxpayer—all 13.6 million of them, not just some. There will be $300 in power bill relief for every single household and more for small businesses; stronger Medicare in every community, with 29 new urgent care clinics being added to the 58 that we have already opened; more homes in every part of the country, with our $32 billion Homes for Australia plan; a better deal for every working parent, with superannuation on paid parental leave; HECS relief, wiping $3 billion off student debt; as well as help for people who are renters, the first back-to-back increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years. We're making these responsible decisions to fight inflation—investing in our skills, our energy security and our supply chains. Of course, we're delivering the second consecutive budget surplus, the first time that has happened in nearly two decades. It comes on the back of the cost-of-living relief we provided in our first two years: cheaper child care, energy bill relief, cheaper medicines that have saved $370 million.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked how this compares with the major economies around the world, the G7 countries. Australia has faster economic growth than Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. We have a lower unemployment rate than Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. We have faster employment growth than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the UK. We have a higher participation rate than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the UK. Of course, Australia has a budget which is in surplus, unlike every single G7 country, and we have the smallest gross debt. This is all a direct result of the conscious decisions that we have made to make sure we provide cost-of-living relief while continuing to put that downward pressure on inflation, whilst also planning for future growth through our Future Made in Australia plan.</span>

Labor has weakened the economy, hurting families and small businesses with its economic decisions. Yesterday's national accounts show Australia has been in a GDP per capita recession for the last five quarters. Business owner Stuart Knox told 10 News: 'If the GFC was 10 out of 10, this is 20 out of 20. This is as tough as I've ever seen it.' Does the Treasurer seriously believe that business owners like Stuart are wrong and his economic plan is right?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  It's gutsy to ask a question about Stuart and small business when they voted against helping small businesses with their energy bills. If you really cared about Stuart and his small business, you wouldn't have done that. Mr Speaker, they wouldn't have done that. So I think people see through these sorts of questions from those opposite. Those opposite couldn't give a stuff about people who are doing it tough. If they had their way, inflation would be higher, growth would be weaker and the budget would be in worse nick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Stuart, I say to the small-business people of this country, I say to families and pensioners right around Australia: we recognise that the economy is soft and that times are tough, but, more than that, we're responding in the budget with cost-of-living relief and support for small business. I'm asked about small business, and it's a perfect opportunity to tell everybody here and everybody who might be tuning in at home that every time those opposite have had the opportunity in the Senate to vote for tax breaks for small businesses they've been voting against them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about that which makes it particularly comical, from their point of view, is that on the same day that the Leader of the Opposition was giving his budget reply, talking about support for small business, they were in the Senate voting against helping small business by providing them a tax break. This is the kind of chaos and confusion and hypocrisy that we hear from those opposite on a daily basis.</span>

We've said that on a number of occasions, even before this week's national accounts. That's why we're responding in the way that we are in the budget. I'd say to Stuart that if he wants the parliament to support small business then he should tell those opposite to vote for small business in the Senate when they're given that opportunity. I'd remind Stuart that, when it came time to support small business with energy bill relief, this side of the House voted for it, and that side of the House voted against it. I'd say to Stuart that the approach put forward by those opposite to slash and burn in the budget would be diabolical for small business in this country. </span>

As members from regional Australia, we do understand that people in our regions and across the country are under pressure at the moment. It is why the government's priority has been cost-of-living relief for Australians. It's why our budget is carefully designed to deliver cost-of-living relief, of course, without adding to inflation. </span>

Just like every taxpayer is getting a tax cut, from 1 July every household will get energy relief. </span>

I went through my file about when did the ministers of the government start talking about fraud. I went through all of the seven coalition ministers for the NDIS. They never put out one press release on challenging or detecting fraud, not one—zip, nada, zilch! So the assumption that the opposition member is making is that somehow, under this government, fraud has started and it never existed under the previous government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I want to thank the wonderful member for Werriwa for her question. In the budget, we're wiping around $3 billion dollars of HECS debt for more than three million Australians, including about 26,000 Australians in the member for Werriwa's electorate. That helps with the cost of degrees. We're also providing financial support for the first time for teaching students, nursing students and social work students while they do their prac. That helps with the cost of living while they're at uni. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also doing something about the cost of a lot of young people missing out on going to university altogether. Almost one in two young Australians in their 20s or 30s have a university degree, but not everywhere—not in the regions and not in our outer suburbs. In Mosman in Sydney, 71 per cent of young adults have a uni degree today, but 50 kilometres away in Mount Druitt it's 33 per cent. In St Lucia in Brisbane it's 75 per cent. In Logan City it's 20 per cent. In Elizabeth Bay it's 68 per cent. In Elizabeth in South Australia it's only seven per cent. That's not fair, and it's also not good for our country because the fact is we need more people to go to TAFE and more people to get a crack at university. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Universities Accord set a target that, by 2050, 80 per cent of our workforce will have a TAFE qualification or a university degree. It says that we're not going to get there unless we help more people from our regions and from our outer suburbs to get to uni and to succeed when they get there. One of the things it recommends is university study hubs in our outer suburbs. We already have them in our regions, and we're rolling out more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, for the first time, we're going to put study hubs in our outer suburbs. Applications for 14 are now open, and I'd encourage all members who represent the outer suburbs of our big cities to work with your local community and put in an application. We've got to smash that invisible barrier that makes a lot of young people in our outer suburbs think that university is not for them and that it's somewhere else for someone else.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just about fairness. It's good for our economy because more people going to TAFE and to university means more skills and more jobs and more people earning more money. Economic analysis from the Department of Education indicates that if we hit that 80 per cent target $240 billion in additional income will be earned across the country over the next two decades. That's more Australians earning more money and it's more jobs in our cities, regions and outer suburbs. </span>

Prime Minister, it's obvious the government doesn't want a gambling advertising ban because it's scared of a backlash from the media and big sporting codes and doesn't want to lose donations from the gambling companies. But this is at entirely at odds with community expectations and what a parliamentary inquiry unanimously recommended a year ago. So why don't you do your job and ban the advertising? Why don't you get it done?</span>

We've agreed with states and territories on new minimum classification for video games with gambling-like content. We've introduced nationally consistent staff training.

You may not like the answer or be happy about what's in the answer, and it may not be addressing what you'd like to be in the answer, but, if you're going to get up and raise a point on relevance just because of that, that's not how the standing orders work.

                  </a>  I'm going through the actions that we are taking. Gambling advertising is about getting people to gamble. That's what it's about, and I'm going through the measures that we have put in place already. We have legislated a ban on the use of credit cards for gambling, which is a major issue and a source of grief out there in the community. That certainly was something that was considered by the committee when it was developing its report. We've also required online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements outlining wins and losses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is continuing to examine further issues and what more can be done, including further restrictions on gambling advertising, but it's not much good if you're shutting down an ad in one place only for it to pop up somewhere else. The truth is that these issues are complex because people in 2024 don't just have televisions or radios; they carry with them devices where ads can pop up and appear and where people can get access not just from Australia but from overseas as well without any controls whatsoever because of the nature of the accounts, the nature of those devices and the nature of the way that the internet operates with VPNs. So we want to make sure that any measures that are taken actually can deliver on the outcome that we want. We want people to not engage in gambling in a way that damages families and causes harm and addiction, because we know that that can have a devastating impact on the community. But we do want to make sure that any measures are got right, and that's why I would encourage the member to continue to work with the government on these issues to make sure that indeed we do get it right.</span>

Labor knows that people are doing it tough, whether that's in McEwen or indeed in Cowan. Since the Albanese government came to office, we've been laser focused on delivering real cost-of-living relief for Australians without adding to inflation. This is not just something we say. It's something that we do by ensuring that people can earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election, the Prime Minister promised to absolutely back an increase to the minimum wage. And now, in government, we've overseen and supported not one, not two, but three wage increases for low-paid workers. From 1 July, the latest increase in the annual wage review will see another 2.6 million workers better off. For early childhood education workers—those dedicated professionals who care for and educate our most precious asset, our children—that's a further 3.75 per cent pay rise. On this side of the House, we see decent wages as part of the solution, not part of the problem, to the cost-of-living challenges. It's why we're not only getting wages moving again but also delivering tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. For an early childhood educator, Labor's tax cuts and the wage increases mean this: an extra $109 per week back in their pockets since we came into office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, the incredible work of early childhood education workers has been overlooked and undervalued. That's why we've also made an historic commitment to provide funding towards a wage increase for early childhood education and care workers. It's an important step to properly valuing them but also an important foundation for the reform that we want to see to the vision that we have for an early childhood education and care sector that is universal in that it is accessible, it is affordable and it is, importantly, inclusive. We've already delivered more affordable early learning for more than a million families, down by 11 per cent on average. We're already delivering cost-of-living relief to our early childhood educators, with more to come.

It's most unfortunate that, when we came to government, we faced a situation where the numbers in our Defence Force were going backwards. This has meant that we have had to be bold when we've looked at what to do to grow our Australian Defence Force. That has meant looking at issues such as how we can engage the permanent resident population of Australia. I was very pleased, along with the Deputy Prime Minister, to be able to announce earlier this week—</span>

I just remind the opposition leader that it's not an opportunity to restate the question, but I appreciate that he is entitled to raise the point of order on relevance. The minister was asked about policy regarding recruitment, so he's going to have to now, at just under one minute in with a preamble, address the question, take it on notice or resume his seat.

                  </a>  As I was trying to get to, the policy that we announced this week, which is very important, about expanding our Defence Force, looking at how we can use permanent residents and making sure that they're suitably vetted goes to New Zealanders from July this year and goes to permanent residents in Australia from Five Eyes nations from 1 January. As I said on Tuesday, as did the Deputy Prime Minister, we have spoken about then looking at our Pacific island neighbours—those that are in our region—and we'll look in that direction after we've moved through New Zealanders in July and then other Five Eyes nations from 1 January. That's what I've spoken about and that's what I've advocated for, and I thank the member for his interest in this, as much as I also thank the member for Canning for his support for the same policy approach as well.</span>

There are 95,000 taxpayers in his electorate, who are heading on 1 July towards a tax cut, and there are also a whole series of award workers among the 2.6 million around the country who get a pay rise on 1 July this year. Those pay rises and tax cuts are possible because we have an Albanese Labor government. That's why they're there. A Labor government will always fight to get wages moving, while a coalition government will always fight to keep wages low.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not simply the award workers who are seeing changes coming. Gig workers, delivery riders and truck drivers are now on a pathway to having some minimum standards where previously they had none, because we changed the law. Aged-care workers have a 15 per cent pay rise because you have the Albanese Labor government. Retail workers are now bargaining with companies that had left the bargaining table for years because the bargaining system was broken but that, because we changed the law, are back at the bargaining table now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers and support staff in non-government schools: there are a whole lot of teachers and support staff in non-government schools who for years went from one short-term contract to the next. Some of them would have qualified if they were permanent for long service leave, yet they still didn't have a secure job. Those workers are now finding themselves being transferred to permanent, direct, secure employment. Sheet metal workers—the people who put the air-conditioning systems together—because we changed the bargaining system, now have a single-interest enterprise agreement, a multi-employer agreement, together, which means they're looking down now at six per cent pay rises every year for four years because we changed the law.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are women working in the finance sector who used to not be able to find out what the men were being paid, because of secrecy clauses that those opposite voted to protect. They weren't successful, we changed the law and people are now able to see where pay equity needs to be fixed. Early childhood education and care workers are at the bargaining table now for pay rises because we changed the law. Coalmine workers are already getting employed directly and seeing increases in their pay because we changed the law. Flight attendants are now seeing—because we changed the laws on same job, same pay—that they're going to be paid properly. Manufacturing workers are now looking down and knowing that they have a government that is backing their secure employment with a future made in Australia. On every one of these, the common factor is that it has happened because of the Albanese Labor government and those opposite said no.</span>

Prior to the 7 October terrorist attacks, approximately 15,000 trucks a month delivered essential humanitarian aid, including food, fuel and water, to Gaza. I understand that approximately 2,020 trucks entered Gaza last month—only 13 per cent of previous levels. Many Australians have grave concerns of impending levels of catastrophic food-and-water insecurity and that a famine may soon be declared. What steps within its power is the government taking to ensure essential humanitarian aid, food and water gets to Gaza?</span>

Indeed, Australia does remain deeply concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. We continue to call for safe, unimpeded and sustained access for humanitarian supplies to enable lifesaving support for civilians in Gaza. We've committed $62.5 million in humanitarian assistance to the region since 7 October—that includes: $41 million to support people affected by the conflict; $11.5 million to refugee programs in Lebanon and Jordan to address the ongoing regional refugee crisis; $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children in Gaza; and $2 million to the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator's new mechanism to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza. Our funding is being directed to conflict-affected people, with a focus on women and children, including to support food, water, medicines and shelter. We're also supporting efforts by Jordan and the UAE to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. We've supplied 140 Australian Defence Force aerial-delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the UAE.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have continued to reiterate our opposition to the ground offensive in Rafah. We called that out, including in advance with a joint statement by me, the Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime Minister of New Zealand. We said this:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is growing international consensus. Israel must listen to its friends and it must listen to the international community. The protection of civilians is paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are clear that a sustainable ceasefire is necessary to finding a path towards securing lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. Ultimately, a negotiated political solution is needed to achieve lasting peace and security. Australia, Canada and New Zealand remain steadfast in their commitment to a two-state solution. We also have supported the call by President Biden and the US proposition which would see an end to the conflict. We have consistently voted month after month in the United Nations for UN resolutions calling for a cessation of conflict. As President Biden has said, a deal would allow the United States and our partners to begin the work to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities destroyed in the chaos of war.</span>

I am very pleased to have had a very small part in helping to make the transition by now ticking-off on 51 renewable energy projects since we came to government. That is enough energy to power well over three million homes. On top of that, we've got another 136 renewable energy projects in the pipeline before us right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, those opposite have a different plan. For 10 years, when they were told that 24 coal-fired power stations were closing, they did nothing to plan for the energy that would be required to replace that electricity in the grid, but they've come up with a plan now. They've come up with a $387 billion fantasy of a plan to roll out nuclear power across the country. We know that Australian homes and businesses are calling for affordable power now. Instead, they are offering the most expensive form of energy in decades to come. We've had the Leader of the Opposition running up and down the east coast of Australia and elsewhere saying: 'Oh, the wind farms! The koalas! They'll be hurt by the wind farms. The whales will be hurt by the wind farms.' What he wants to do is dump John Howard's environment laws so he can build nuclear reactors anywhere. What we know about those opposite is that it's the fast track for nuclear and the slow lane for renewables.</span>

In January 2023, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'If you google "small modular reactors", then have a look at what a company like NuScale is doing.' Very good advice! I always take the Leader of the Opposition seriously; someone's got to. So I did google NuScale. The first item says 'Flagship US nuclear reactor project collapses owing taxpayers $930m'. The second one says 'Small modular nuclear reactor that was hailed by coalition as future cancelled due to rising costs'. The third one says 'Cancelled NuScale contract weighs heavy on new nuclear'. It was all about small modular reactors, and then the Leader of the Opposition doubled down and told journalists—he told Sky, I believe it was, in March 2023: 'I don't support the establishment of big nuclear facilities here at all. I am opposed to it.' Pretty clear.

Indeed, when we depart from this place this afternoon there will be a couple of weeks and then we'll be back, and then it will be almost July—almost at that point when every single taxpayer will get a tax cut on 1 July, almost at that point where every household will get $300 of energy price relief. Our budget will deliver that cost-of-living support Australians need. It will also be the case, importantly, that there will be a third consecutive boost in the minimum wage for 2.6 million low-wage workers. Australians, from 1 July, will earn more and they will get to keep more of what they earn, and that will be important. It will happen whether they live in Anglesea or Gippsland or around Jervis Bay or Newcastle or Gladstone or Collie or perhaps even Bribie Island. All those, of course, are potential locations for the nuclear reactionaries over there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they know they'll get a tax cut, they know they'll get household energy relief, they know they'll get a wage increase—but will they get a reactor with it? Twelve weeks ago this Leader of the Opposition said it would come in two weeks, so maybe if we just forget about that period in between—we'll just wipe that off! We need to see the colour of this Leader of the Opposition's money. The same people who couldn't build a commuter car park, who thought the NBN should be built with copper rather than fibre, want us to believe they're going to build nuclear reactors here in Australia. Where are they going to go, who's going to pay for them, what's the cost, what's the timeframe and what will they do in between the 15 years at least it will take to ensure our energy security?</span>

                  </a>  I am happy to withdraw the word 'deliberate'. Let's just remind the House what was said by the minister for the NDIS. He made the factually incorrect claim that none of the seven ministers for the NDIS under the previous coalition government had issued a media release in relation to fraud. He went on to emphasise that statement with the use of words like 'zip' and 'nada', but what he said was completely, factually incorrect. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make the point that on 18 October 2018 a media release was issued by the now Leader of the Opposition, together with me, then Minister for Families and Social Services, and the minister with responsibility for the NDIS at that time, headed 'NDIS taskforce makes first arrest'. It read:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition Government established the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Fraud Taskforce in July to tackle potential fraud against the NDIS.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was not a one-off. That was not the only media release issued over a period in which a number of coalition ministers had responsibility for the NDIS. For example, on 22 April 2021, a media release was issued by the then Minister for Home Affairs and the then Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That media release was headed 'Morrison government moves to protect NDIS from organised crime'. It read:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an investigation being carried out in relation to alleged fraud against the NDIS, and a media release was issued by two coalition ministers, including the coalition minister then responsible for the NDIS.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The media release spoke of the specialist National Disability Insurance Agency Compliance Response Team.

But, in fact, we know that there was a deal done under which Chiquita Mushrooms workers, represented by the AWU, ended up with terms that were not as good as many other workers'. There were unusual payments to the union. The union received a $4,000 payment per month over six months in return for what the union, then led by the current member for Maribyrnong, claimed was for health and safety training.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that it may be the case that the member for Maribyrnong is used to operating in environments where he could get away with making statements that are entirely factually wrong and, by consequence, make claims against individuals and indeed people who have had significant positions of responsibility in this nation which are entirely factually incorrect. He may be used to working in environments where he's able to do that. But this is not such an environment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you make a statement in this place which is clearly demonstrably and factually wrong, and if you make that statement and preface it with clear evidence that you have prepared making that statement and that you've gone through your files, you can hardly then say, 'It was an accident; I somehow managed to miss the five media releases', which I was able to find with the assistance of my hardworking staff and other hardworking coalition staff in about 15 minutes. Five media releases—there may very well be more. We haven't found just one that proved that what he said was factually incorrect. We haven't found just two. We haven't found three. We found five in literally a few minutes. I doubt there has been, certainly in this term of parliament and perhaps for a very long time, such an exercise in making a statement which is clearly untrue and which is clearly calculated to provide political advantage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the minister was seeking to do was position himself as some kind of holder of virtue on this matter as the person who has solely twigged to the fact that there may be a risk of fraud. He should have twigged to this a very long ago, because he was the genius who created this in the first place. Every one of those coalition ministers worked very hard to try and clean up the mess he created. In the two years that he has been in government, he has done very little about it. The best he can do is make statements which are entirely factually incorrect about the record of coalition ministers. So this minister needs to return and apologise.</span>

The suspension of standing and sessional orders is very important because we now have one hour and 15 minutes left of parliament this week and it's so important that the member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for the NDIS, responsible for one of the most important parts of government, comes back into this chamber and explain why he has, accidentally or otherwise, misled the House on this very important issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He cannot have gone through his files and found that the coalition, when in government, did nothing about fraud in this important space. To say otherwise is to malign those very good, hardworking ministers of the coalition who did absolutely everything to make sure that any fraudulent activity was not only addressed but brought to heel by the then government. The member for Maribyrnong has been here since 2007. He knows better than to go to that dispatch box and suggest that something otherwise was done. Indeed, we put in place measures to absolutely crack down on fraudulent activity. You heard from the member for Bradfield, who feels slighted by the fact that something else was suggested, that the member for McPherson produced a media release that absolutely said that not only were we cracking down on fraudulent activity but there was a fellow who was arrested for that very thing.</span>

Maybe his speechwriter has suggested otherwise and he has his mind on other things, maybe ambassadorial roles. But he knows better than to go to that dispatch box in question time, where the truth is important. The truth is important. When you are a minister, you have to tell the truth. Whether it was an accident or otherwise, we do believe he has absolutely misled this House. It's important that he has an hour and 12 minutes to come back into this chamber. The House practice absolutely demands he do so. We are requesting that he does so. Convention of the Westminster system absolutely makes it crystal clear that he should come back into this House and explain himself, come back into this House and admit that he was wrong. It's not hard to say you were wrong. It's up to him to say that he was wrong. He knows that he was wrong. He can't suggest that the coalition never put out a media release and his file suggested there were no media releases, because we know and have proven in these statements that the actual fact was otherwise.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's rather damning to suggest that the coalition when in government did not do anything about fraud in the NDIS space. The minister, the former opposition leader who led Labor to the 2016 and 2019 elections—not quite sure how that went for him!—is very senior. He's been in this place as the member for Maribyrnong since 2007. It's incumbent upon him to come back into this chamber, explain himself, admit that he got it wrong and admit that perhaps that speechwriter to whom we're paying $600,000 worth of taxpayers' money got it wrong. Somebody got it wrong, but the buck stops with him because he was the one who said it. He was the one who erroneously claimed that the now opposition—the then government—did nothing to crack down on fraud in the NDIS. We did, and we've had minister after minister say that very thing. We've got the media releases.</span>

The member for Maribyrnong says he hasn't got them in his files, but he would have. He only had to ask his department and they would've produced them. To suggest anything else is breaching convention. It is breaching the Westminster system. It is breaching House of Representatives practice and it's breaching the good grace of this parliament, where truth is important.</span>

This minister, today, has not been any of those things, and it's up to him to come back into this chamber now, and if the member for Watson, or whoever is following me in the speech, has even an absolutely slight consideration of how important House practice is, how important the Westminster system is—and here he is, thankfully! Hopefully, he's going to make that truth be accountable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  I said in question time that the now opposition, when they were in government, did nothing to tackle fraud and allowed the circumstances to dictate whether crooks could come in. Did I hear in this motion any outrage about that? No! I also said that they didn't reform the NDIS and that they allowed a set of circumstances where participants were not getting a good deal or being looked after. Did they complain about that? No, they didn't. But what I should've realised is that the only way you can get something more than a heartbeat out of the opposition is to say that they didn't issue a press release. I apologise for missing the five press releases you did in nine years—or the six or the 10.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I'm most amused about—and I don't know if there is a capacity for insight and self-reflection on the part of whoever dreamed this tactic up—is that there was no outrage about the NDIS, no outrage about their lack of effort in reform and no outrage about the payment systems they allowed to occur, but, 'Goodness me! I will fight to the death if you insult me for not putting out a press release.' How do you find a lost coalition politician in the forest? You stake an allegation that they didn't issue a press release and they will find you!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the Manager of Opposition Business and I waited for him to go through all of the actions they took to fix up NDIS fraud. But, to be fair to him, he couldn't talk about it, because you did nothing. You did absolutely nothing. This is what we found out upon coming to government. We found out that, under the current opposition, they had a payment system in the NDIS where thousands of invoices were submitted, and each day they would check 20—20 out of thousands—before they paid it. On a really good day, apparently they could go up to 21.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we also found out—and I'm sure, when I say this, the little voices inside some of the coalition members' heads are going to say, 'How could that have happened?'—that between 5 pm and 6.30 pm on any day when these characters were mismanaging the NDIS, if an invoice whistled in—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission—the poor old NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. For those of you who aren't students of history, we called for a disability royal commission in 2017. The former Prime Minister Mr Turnbull panicked and said, 'Oh, we can't have a royal commission.' That didn't work so well for him. He said, 'Instead we'll set up a quality and safeguards commission.' It opened its doors on 1 January 2018. The problem was that they put only 350 people into it. Then what happened was that those people weren't able to do their job properly. What we've seen since we came in, on top of our Fraud Fusion Task Force, our extra investigators and the range of other measures I've already outlined, such as changing payment system so we scrutinise them—that's a revolutionary idea!—is that we've now doubled the staff in the safeguards commission.</span>

When I became the minister, there was $231 million of NDIS payments under scrutiny. There's now several billion. When I came in, they had 41 investigations underway. There are now 220. There are now 510 compliance actions underway. We have 20 matters in court and another 12 matters with the DPP waiting to be progressed to court.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have broken their promise to reform our environmental laws. Under the existing laws, hundreds of fossil fuel projects have been approved, millions of hectares of critical habitat have been cleared and record numbers of species have been added to the threatened list—that's patently not environmental protection. Instead, Labor have listened only to their mates and their generous donors in the fossil fuel industry and have delayed these crucial reforms. Environmental protection can wait, but, if you're a fossil fuel company, Labor won't hesitate to act on your directives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of actually, practically, directly reforming our environmental laws, we get this damp-squib, this wet-blanket, set of bills that are designed to do nothing more than placate those who've been fighting for decades for better environmental protection. This agency will be a glorified department that will be enforcing the same set of laws that we already know are completely inadequate. This is nothing less than a betrayal of the environment, of threatened species and of the millions of Australians who voted for climate action and environmental protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the Greens who are critical of this disastrous decision to delay environmental law reform; it's the Australian Conservation Foundation, who said they are 'frustrated and deeply disappointed'. It's also the Wilderness Society, who said the proposed EPA 'lacks the independence and integrity needed to shield development and environmental decision-making from undue influence by vested interests'. What these groups know is that Labor's EPA bill won't save our wildlife, it won't stop native-forest logging and it won't stop the expansion of climate-wrecking coal and gas mines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who does approve of these reforms? There are no prizes for guessing. It's the mining industry and it's the gas industry. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia called it '"better for business" objectives'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>The Minerals Council of Australia love that the new laws contain a ministerial veto, because, of course, that means they can use their influence to get decisions they don't like overturned. In my electorate of Ryan, which is so blessed with large areas of bushland, beautiful creekways and wildlife, there are many active volunteer environmental groups working tirelessly to preserve, nurture and restore our precious natural environments. It's an uphill battle, though, while this government continues to cause the climate change that is cooking our planet and destroying nature, while it wilfully embraces the gas cartels, letting the likes of Santos and Woodside virtually write their environmental policies, and while it announces more gas exploration despite the looming climate catastrophe. This is not a transition to net zero as they claim; it's a transition to climate disaster and the devastation of our natural environments and systems. This legislation does absolutely nothing to address that catastrophic outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So happy World Environment Day for yesterday, everybody, but it's hard to celebrate that when we are on track for 2.5 to three degrees of warming. This means that the world as we know it will be unimaginably changed. We'll have more frequent and intense floods and droughts that will cause major environmental damage. This dystopian vision is not hyperbole; this is what our eminent scientists are telling us. Is this government—a government that promised climate action—so ignorant, so uncaring or simply so beholden to their mates in the fossil fuel industry that they're comprehensively selling out the future of our children and grandchildren?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent review into the EPBC Act by Professor Graeme Samuel way back in 2020 contained 38 recommendations. The need for reform is urgent. It's very clear that the delay in acting on these recommendations is not about finessing the final legislation but about Labor yet again bowing to the fossil fuel lobby. The Samuel review was also highly critical of the existing act 'not fulfilling its objectives as they relate to the role of Indigenous Australians in protecting and conserving biodiversity, working in partnership with and promoting the respectful use of their knowledge'. Additionally, the review noted 'a culture of tokenism and symbolism', meaning that the views of First Nations people about their own land and their knowledge of their own land are not being incorporated. First Nations people are entitled to expect stronger protections of cultural heritage and the incorporation of their knowledge into management practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we have a bill that is an environmental protection smokescreen. Again, this is Labor putting up legislation to give the impression of doing something—smoke, mirrors, a vibe. Tragically, though, it does nothing to avert the cascading crises of species extinction, habitat destruction and climate catastrophe exacerbated by Labor's inaction. For these reasons the Greens will oppose this bill in the House. We will reserve our position in the Senate and await the findings of the Senate inquiries into this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise to speak to the substance of this bill before us, the Nature Positive (Environment Protection Australia) Bill 2024. What a load of rubbish I've had to listen to, about how it's not going to do anything. This is a significant step forward in protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know everyone in this place thinks that the area they represent is special and unique, but the area that lies within and surrounds the electorate of Macquarie is World Heritage listed, and the Blue Mountains is the only city within a World Heritage area anywhere in the world. Our World Heritage area has eight protected areas: the Blue Mountains, Wollemi, Yengo, Nattai, Kanangra-Boyd, Gardens of Stone and Thirlmere Lakes national parks, and the Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve. It's 1.03 million hectares of eucalyptus dominated landscape, one of the largest and most intact tracts of protected bushland in the country. The diverse plant communities and habitats support more than 400 animal species, of which 40 are threatened. There are 52 mammal species, 63 reptile species, over 30 frog species and about one-third of Australia's bird species. There are vertebrates like the platypus and the echidna, and, although invertebrates are still poorly known, there are around 120 butterfly and 4,000 moth species. The richness of our fauna and flora is almost beyond comprehension. It includes, of course, the Wollemi pine, something from the time of the dinosaurs. Ongoing research continues to reveal the rich scientific value of the area as more species are discovered. This exceptional biodiversity is complemented by equally special Indigenous heritage as well as post-European-settlement cultural values, geodiversity, water production, wilderness, recreation and natural beauty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I chose to live in this World Heritage area more than 30 years ago, and now three generations of my extended family live in the Blue Mountains, so I care, and my community cares. I would not be backing this bill if I didn't believe that it is a significant step forward, a step in reversing the extinction and destruction of native species and protecting our environment better than it ever has been before. Finally we will have an independent national environment protection agency, which will have much stronger powers than anything the current department has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right upfront let me say that I know, as I'm saying this, there are good people thinking, 'Yeah, that's great, but we want more.' Well, of course we do. We all want more, and it is Labor's commitment to do more, to build on the traditions of past Labor governments and shift the protections. Our job is as hard as any Labor government's has been: to make sure we have laws that are fit for the 21st century, where our scientific knowledge means we know much better than any Labor government before us how vital it is that we get this right.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  If anyone is still in denial about the impact of climate change and the need for action, this past summer in WA should lay that to rest. Last week it started to rain in Perth. This is the first significant rain on record since September 2023. That's more than eight months without rain. The rain last week was far too late for the forests, scarp, heathlands and shrublands that have turned brown and died north and south of Perth, from Shark Bay to Albany. This mass death of vegetation we're witnessing in WA is known as a forest collapse. Forest collapses change the structure of our forests, which results in a higher risk of bushfire. Animals and plants are stressed and experiencing cumulative decline. This is the land equivalent of a mass coral bleaching event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over generations, our unique WA flora and fauna has evolved and adapted impressive ecosystems. WA plants know how to cope with a hot summer, but this summer was off the charts. In so many places in my electorate of Curtin you now see dead trees and plants: walking around Lake Claremont or Lake Monger, on the dunes in front of Scarborough Beach, along Nedlands foreshore, through Bold Park, in Point Resolution Reserve or along Minim Cove in Mosman Park. It's heartbreaking, and it should be the wake-up call we need. A forest collapse sounds dystopian, but it's happening right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2022 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the environment</span> report painted a particularly dire picture for Western Australia: a catastrophic combination of climate change, habitat loss, invasive species and resource extraction. Climate change models have long highlighted the south-west of Western Australia as a warming and drying hotspot. The heatwaves in February were a tipping point and habitats are now at risk. In a briefing from climate scientists and IPCC author Joelle Gergis on Monday, I heard that 2023 was the earth's warmest year in at least 125,000 years, and we may now be seeing the signs of the start of abrupt climate change, where feedback loops are triggered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, an area the size of Western Australia was found to be missing from Antarctic sea ice. Today, the Secretary-General of the UN announced that new data from the World Meteorological Organization shows that we've breached the 1.5-degree target in the year to May 2024. We know what is causing this change in our climate. CO2 accounts for most of the damage, but natural gas or methane is 80 times as damaging over a 20-year period. About half of the CO2 accumulated in the atmosphere has been emitted since 1990, when the first IPCC report was released warning the world about the impact of fossil fuels. We know we have to reduce our carbon emissions, but you wouldn't know about it in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WA's carbon emissions levels this year are going to be 20 per cent higher than 2005, which would make our 2050 net-zero target pretty much impossible to reach. The WA parliament is currently debating the WA Climate Change Bill. It was introduced in November last year but still hasn't passed the lower house. This legislation should be an opportunity for the WA government to be ambitious and decisive and show how serious it is about climate change and our rising greenhouse gas emissions. But, as drafted, it falls well short. The WA legislation includes no targets for 2030, or any other year before 2050, and no plans for how we will get to net zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time the WA parliament debates the introduction of its climate change act, the federal government has introduced its policy platform called the Future Gas Strategy. The government describes this strategy as its 'plan for how gas will support our economy's transition to a net zero partnership with the world'. But it reads like a plan to maintain and expand gas beyond 2050. We cannot expand fossil fuels to get to net zero. The science just doesn't work like that. Neither the gas strategy nor the WA Climate Change Bill reflects a commitment to address the urgent climate change imperatives we're facing and the work we need to do to transition to net zero. Neither strategy nor bill will halt the devastating impact of climate change on our environment like forest collapse and set us up for a livable and prosperous future. We need to speed up our transition away from fossil fuels and we need to do it now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Three thousand everyday Aussies—dads and mums, grandparents, police officers, nurses, schoolteachers, students, veterans, truck drivers, children—commit suicide every single year in Australia. That's nine everyday Aussies every day. It is the leading cause of death among young people in Australia. Seven out of nine of those everyday Aussies that take their own life every day are everyday Aussie men. In fact, men aged 18 to 44 are the most at-risk group for taking their own lives. Seventy-five per cent of suicides are accounted for by men. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the start of my speech in this adjournment debate is a very raw, hard-to-swallow and hard-to-comprehend state of affairs. But I can tell you, it is so much harder for the families of those who deal with the grief, the questions and the what-ifs every day after suicide impacts them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At home in South Australia, I recently attended a Men's Meals and Mental Health dinner. The event was run by the incredible Breakthrough Mental Health Research Foundation. John Mannion and his team from Breakthrough brought together 600 everyday Aussie men to talk to confront a very serious issue. In doing so, the Breakthrough Mental Health Research Foundation raised in excess of $360,000, with money going towards the establishment of a suicide prevention fellowship in men's mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredible courage was shown by South Australia's police commissioner, who took the time to confront the audience and speak about the loss of his dear son, Charlie. The event was tough at times, but incredibly well thought out and incredibly well received by the audience. For me, the highlight of the event was an audience engagement activity called 'step to the line'. In this activity with 600 other men, we gathered around the Adelaide Oval face-to-face and were encouraged to be brave, to be vulnerable, to step forward as a declaration and to identify to ourselves what thoughts and actions were affecting the 600 everyday men gathered together that evening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this moment, it brought up circumstances, events and personal feelings that I too felt, like the loss of my father. Following his passing, I had a period of time when I went down that rabbit hole—that place that takes you into a dark area and you start to contemplate what's good in your life. I have to say it was my wife, who was one of my best friends at the time, who helped pull me out of that dark hole, showed me the light and got me back onto the road to recovery so that I could get on with my life and continue to contribute the way that I do now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated earlier, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people in Australia. Upon reflection on my own journey, I knew coming to this place as an elected member, this was something that I would have to confront, and help to make change so that more support is available to young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly grateful that the community I represent, the northern suburbs of Adelaide, will be home to a new headspace centre. Headspace is the primary national platform for young people aged 12 to 25 years old who are experiencing or at risk of mild to moderate mental illness. Headspace services provide care in four key areas: mental health, related physical and sexual health, alcohol and other drug support and vocational services. Our government has invested more than $290 million into the headspace program in the 2023-24 financial year. The new headspace centre, to be located in Gawler, is good news for local families and the whole community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, there is always more—more money, more initiatives and more ideas. As a society and a community, there is every day. Every day, check on those that you know are doing it tough. Every day, be kind to that hospitality worker running between customers to serve you. Every day, stop and have a chat with your neighbour when putting the bins out and checking the letterbox. Every day, take time after school to sit down with your children and to ask them if they are okay. What we know is that thoughts are not always worn on one's face or in one's disposition. The mask of bravery hides the pain, the isolation and the compounding thoughts that there isn't any hope. Every day we all need to do our part for our fellow everyday Aussie. If you're in need of help, please reach out to one of the following: Lifeline Australia, 131114; Beyond Blue, 1300224636; or headspace, 1800650890.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Can I commend the member for Spence for speaking on such an important topic. He's providing the leadership that we need on this issue, and I'm sure that, if all of us here were honest, we would all have our own stories to tell. Thank you very much, Member for Spence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation picks its victims very unfairly. I'm sure that any of us who go around our electorates will meet those who are unfortunate enough to be bearing the full brunt of the cost-of-living crisis that we're going through, but we'll also see people who have come through this not just unscathed but ahead. That's the way inflation works. Some people bear the cost more than others. This causes me to bring the moral case forward for a reduction in government spending, which is what I will be talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a per capita recession here in Australia. We have been for the last five quarters. The national account figures that we saw released yesterday confirmed that. What this means is that we're going backwards, and this is sadly being papered over because of the government's deployment of immigration policies which are increasing the size of the pie, but everyone's small bit of it has just got that much smaller. That's what a per capita recession is. The government is very keen to keep us out of a technical recession. To be very clear, I hope that we are able to stay clear of that. But they're keeping us out by the deployment of this immigration policy. We brought in 500,000 people in the 12 months leading up to last September. This is an unprecedented amount. It is the only thing that's keeping us out of that technical recession. I want to raise this, because, when we look at our electorates, we'll see the different demographics who are hurting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The group that troubles me most is the 21- to 29-year-olds, who have seen their discretionary and non-discretionary spending go backwards. They're the only demographic that has had that happen to them. Their ability to save for a house is reduced because the cost of everything is going up, and, even if they are able to get a loan from the bank of mum and dad, their ability to service a loan on a house is non-existent as well. These are people at the start of their careers, probably on lower wages, and they are experiencing cost pressures across the board. To make things worse, we saw in the media just yesterday that the government's housing plan has not delivered a single house yet and, according to the industry experts, will not deliver another house in this term of government. So the answer that they have been given is empty. The promise, 'No, we'll sort out housing,' is empty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I have concern for that group, and I have concern for pensioners who are renting on a fixed income. The cost of everything around them is going up. These are people who have contributed to our society and contributed to the economy. In what should be their golden years, their standard of living is going backwards. I can't help but look across the economy and say, 'This isn't the Australia we want.' This is the problem with inflation. It doesn't lay like a blanket evenly across us. Some people hurt more than others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every major economist has come out and said that this budget and the government's policies are not helping fight inflation. In fact, they are inflationary. We have a situation where the RBA is trying to pull money out of the economy by raising interest rates, and we have a government that is pushing money back in. That's why we're stuck here. We're not moderating; we're stuck. We were supposed to see an interest rate drop this year. Now we've got the Governor of the RBA still keeping alive the prospect of a rise in the next 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing spending is not something that is only a partisan point of view. I go back to the fact that the last government that reduced spending three years in a row was the Hawke government. They had to. It was a position that they had to take. When I raise the issue of reducing government spending, I get back this position as if there's something inherently negative within the Liberal Party. No, this is sensible government. There is a narrow path we must walk together with the RBA and with the Australian people, back into that target band of two to three per cent inflation. We're not going to get there if the government and the RBA are fighting against each other. By continuing to pour fuel on the fire, the government is keeping inflation up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation picks its victims very unfairly. There is a moral case for reducing government spending, and I think we need to take that case up and take it to the Australian people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Earlier this week Julie Ware, Rebecca Wilmott and the dedicated team at the Brotherhood of St Laurence opened the Thrive Hub, in Frankston. In her opening address, Julie Ware, from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, described the hub as a place for young people in Frankston, where they can get meaningful support and assistance:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Hub is a service designed to meet the unique needs of individuals from the one place—combining access to employment and training opportunities with a range of services including mental health, drug and alcohol, homelessness, education and disability supports…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said the Thrive Hub 'is aimed at knocking down barriers and building capability and resilience'. Last month I also attended the Brotherhood of St Laurence's Community Investment Committee, led by Rebecca Wilmott. The aim of the committee is to engage employers and community service organisations in the co-design and creation of local solutions like the Thrive Hub for young people experiencing disadvantage so they can transition into work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Thrive Hub and the Community Investment Committee are critical initiatives delivered in Dunkley to address the issues of youth disengagement and youth unemployment. Youth unemployment in Dunkley sits at 16 per cent, which is double the national average. The committee brings together representatives and experts from headspace, the David Scott School, the Frankston Mornington Peninsula Local Learning and Employment Network, Totally Workwear, Lendlease and Chisholm TAFE. This meeting supports the people participating to understand the barriers for young people into unemployment, which include transport accessibility and disengagement of young people from secondary school post COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bek, the head of Youth Transitions, highlighted the issue of disengagement from school. She regularly receives phone calls from distressed parents about their 13-year-olds refusing to go to school. She stated to me, 'We are seeing the effects of COVID on young people in significant numbers.' That is a comment I continue to hear as a parent and heard across the Dunkley by-election campaign. Bek explained that the Thrive Hub is a person centred service that has been established to provide connections both to young people and to their parents. It is a one-stop shop linking young people and parents to the service system, ensuring they receive the help they need when they need it—like Tayah, who spoke at the launch of the Thrive Hub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tayah is 17 years of age and shared with those at the event that she had disengaged from school. After engaging with the team at the Brotherhood, she was supported to identify her goals and chose to complete a number of microcredentials. The process of being supported to identify goals empowered her to return to education and re-engage in the love of learning. Thanks to the guidance and support from Brotherhood staff, Tayah has completed a traffic control course and has taken up a traineeship with Lendlease at the Frankston Hospital redevelopment. She is currently undertaking a cert II in construction, working four days for a plumber, and plans to complete a cert IV, after which she will undertake an apprenticeship. This is an exceptional story. Tayah's transformation comes from the provision of individual support from Brotherhood staff. Their commitment to supporting young people to live up to their potential is central to the success of young people like Tayah.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Thrive Hub model is focused on building respectful and supportive relationships between young people, their parents and staff. This focus is central to the success of the service. Having worked with young people to deliver employment, training and personal development programs for 20 years in Frankston, across the state and nationally, I know the value and impact of place based collaborative initiatives that provide a one-stop shop for young people, their parents and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the Brotherhood of St Laurence for establishing this initiative. I am pleased that the Thrive Hub is located in Dunkley. As the federal member for Dunkley, I will advocate for this initiative and the opportunity we have to support more young people so that no-one is left behind and our young people can get ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I ask a question that I ask Australians and other members of my community right now: are you better off or worse off after two years of this Labor government? The answer is universally, 'I am worse off.' The figures that I'm going to read out now are the figures that explain why families and businesses are feeling worse off now than they were two years ago. We saw this week the quarterly GDP number come out at 0.1 per cent. Except for the two quarters we had during the pandemic, which were obviously very unusual, that was the weakest quarterly growth that we've seen since 1991. When you take GDP per capita—that means GDP per person; we were growing by taking more people into the country at the time—it was actually a fall of 0.4 per cent for the quarter, and we've now had five quarters of negative GDP when you look at the growth in the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity—this is a really scary one—has fallen 5.2 per cent under this government from March 2022 to March 2024. That's saying we're becoming less productive, less efficient, in what we do and how we do things. It is more expensive. That's a very scary figure for the future of our country right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From March 2022 to March 2024, Australian households have been paying 20 per cent more income tax. Interest payments—this is huge, as I know you know, Speaker—paid on mortgages rose 3.9 per cent for the quarter and have increased 30 per cent since the election. Most people's mortgages have almost tripled. Prices have increased 9.8 per cent from May 2022 to April 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another figure that explains why families and businesses are feeling poorer. Real household disposable income has fallen nearly two per cent over the year on a per capita basis, and since the election real disposable income has fallen nearly eight per cent on a per capita basis. The household savings ratio, at 0.9 per cent, is down 9.9 percentage points since the election. As we know, we've had big population growth through that, which has affected some of those figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us, as MPs and parliamentarians, go around our communities all the time, and the biggest issue of the day for the whole of the two years has been cost of living. When you look at a typical family—we've used this on a number of occasions on this side of the House. We talk about where a family is today relative to two years ago. The figures say that a typical family is $35,000 a year worse off. You could ask, 'Where do you get that figure from?' This is a typical house with a mortgage, and a big part of that—over 20 per cent—is their increased mortgage cost. An average mortgage is around $700,000 to $800,000. When you look at the increase in mortgage cost over that period, that's over $20,000 extra taken out of an average family's income. We also have food up 11 per cent, housing up 14 per cent, rents up 13 per cent, electricity up 20 per cent, gas up 25 per cent, health up 11 per cent, education up 11 per cent and financial insurance up 11 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side we all acknowledge that, especially at the initial stage of this inflationary upswing, some of this was global. We did have Ukraine. We had some supply chain issues as well. There were some inflationary pressures around the world. But the Reserve Bank and our leading economists are now saying our inflation is homegrown, not necessarily like it was two years ago. It's homegrown now after two years of this Labor government. Core inflation is higher than the US, the UK, Japan, Canada and the euro area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is this government doing that has caused our inflation rate to be higher than others? One thing is government spending. They're now spending $315 billion more than we were two years ago. That's a lot of increase in spending, which is inflationary of itself. We had a bill today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024, which was in part about scope 3 emissions. Accounting for scope 3 emissions has added to the inflationary pressures. We had the truckie tax that they introduced, which was basically a tax on getting anything to a supermarket and which was inflationary as well. Something that is yet to come through but is not going to help either is the ute tax. So Australians are feeling worse off than they were two years ago because of this Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  In this sitting fortnight, I've had the opportunity to attend two briefings from aid workers who are providing aid in Gaza. One was organised by my Labor colleague the member for Reid, Sally Sitou, and that was with workers from UNICEF who are currently in Gaza and who joined us online. We were able to talk with them and hear from them directly. Another was on Monday this week, a briefing organised by Senator David Pocock with Medecins Sans Frontieres, where we heard from Arunn Jegan, head of mission for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, where he's responsible for MSF's health related programming in Gaza; from Scarlett Wong, a clinical psychologist and mental health activity manager for MSF, responsible for coordinating the mental health emergency response in southern Gaza; and Dr Sanjay Adusumilli, who was working as a surgeon there. There were many from the Canberra community at Senator Pocock's briefing in the theatrette here in Parliament House. I want to thank the member for Reid and Senator Pocock for organising these briefings, because I think it's incredibly important that people have the opportunity to hear from people who are there on the ground in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, both of these briefings were incredibly confronting. We saw horrific injuries, particularly of children; we saw a health system that has been completely destroyed to the point that it was incapable of really helping these people, in spite of the wonderful help of these workers; and we saw a worsening humanitarian crisis, with people unable to access water and food. I was really struck by the bravery and selflessness of these aid workers, people who updated their wills, wrote goodbye letters to their loved ones and headed into what is currently hell on earth to help others. I want to very sincerely say that we all owe these aid workers our deepest gratitude and admiration for what they are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What really struck me was the senselessness of this—the senseless killing of innocent people, so many of them children. So many people have had their lives destroyed because their entire families have been killed. People have suffered horrific injuries from which they will never recover and, of course, trauma from which they will never recover. This is man-made, inflicted by others, and it includes the man-made starvation that is happening there. Little children and babies are being treated for severe malnutrition that could so easily never have been caused and could easily be prevented if aid were able to get in there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This must stop. We need an immediate ceasefire, and we need an enduring path to peace. I note that it's been six months since our government joined many other countries at the UN in voting for that ceasefire. We also reiterate calls that hostages be released so that this can be progressed. The Netanyahu government must heed the calls of the international community to halt their attacks on Rafah, where almost half of Gaza's population went to shelter and were told they would be safe. International law and the ICC must be respected. Just last night 27 people were killed and dozens injured in an Israeli strike on a school in al-Nuseirat. This is part of a renewed operation in central Gaza by Israel. The school was run by UNRWA and was housing hundreds of displaced families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge so many people in my community who are rightfully deeply distressed by this, and I want to thank them for continuing to write to me about this. I acknowledge their right to peaceful protest, and 'peaceful' is an important word there. I understand where they are coming from. I talked with a young woman who was protesting outside my office and who said, 'I just want to stand here until this stops.' I say to my community that I feel this and that we all do. We all want this to stop. I thank them for their advocacy, but I say: please know that I am listening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-GeneralBold">)</span> (<span class="HPS-Time">09:40</span>):  This is a historic day for the Federation Chamber, so I'm going to begin with a brief statement before going on to constituency statements. I'd like to formally recognise the 30th anniversary of the Federation Chamber, which is in two days time. What was then known as the Main Committee met here for the first time on 8 June 1994, with Deputy Speaker Harry Jenkins in the chair. In 1993, the Procedure Committee argued for the establishment of the Main Committee, noting that it would allow more legislation to be dealt with in a given number of days and enable more time to be given to individual bills. In February 1994, the House responded by amending standing orders to provide for a Main Committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those initial days, the Main Committee had more limited functions than it does now. Bills could be debated and considered in detail. Debate on committee and delegation reports, having been presented in the House, could be continued in this Chamber. Legislation has been a primary focus throughout its history. To date, 1,570 bills have been referred to this Chamber, and members have spent over 2,340 hours debating legislation here. However, since its inception, the role of this second chamber has continued to grow, from the introduction of members' three-minute statements in 1997 to becoming the venue for the grievance debate in 2008. Over time it has also helped to increase the time available for private members' business. Since 2016, Mondays have been dedicated entirely to opportunities for private members. In February 2012, the House agreed to amend standing orders to change the Main Committee's name to the Federation Chamber, in recognition of the importance of the House's second chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a parallel debating chamber, the Federation Chamber has made a significant contribution to managing the work of the House. It has been a way to trial procedures and has inspired other legislators to try new ways of working. The UK House of Commons looked closely at our model before establishing its own parallel debating chamber, the Westminster Hall. Today, on its 1,391st meeting since establishment, I say: happy 30th birthday to the Federation Chamber. Thank you all for being here to celebrate such an important occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Off script, I want to give thanks for the 30 years of service provided by clerks of the table, attendants and all of the members who've preceded us, and I thank the members of the public who've joined us. It's a little-known fact that the Federation Chamber exists, and it's important that we celebrate what has been a very unique and successful Australian innovation in the way we do parliament and democracy here. Thank you for sharing in this special occasion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  In the last year I've been inundated with messages from people right across my community who are at their wits' end with the volume of air traffic over their homes in the densely populated suburbs in and around Hunters Hill, Boronia Park and Lane Cove. These people report relentless air traffic only minutes apart between 5.50 am and 11 pm; incessant aircraft noise that makes it difficult to work from home, disturbs sleep and diminishes enjoyment of outdoor recreation; difficulty hearing themselves in conversation, hearing their television or hearing phone calls; and being exhausted and debilitated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have been trying to raise their concerns with Airservices Australia and the Sydney airport authority for some time, yet their appeals for relief have gone ignored and unheeded. This is despite the fact that for many years now we have had an overarching air traffic framework in place that is supposed to ensure no one community in the Sydney Basin is left carrying a disproportionate share of this burden. In the words of one person: 'I've been keeping a record of the noise levels and quite often they exceed 70 decibels. On a busy day, incoming flights can be every two minutes, so the whining and thumping is almost continuous. Under medical instructions I'm supposed to sit outside every day, but this has become anything but a pleasant experience.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know Sydney's airports are the busiest in our country, and many of us value the ease with which we're able to access them. The aircraft noise generated by these airports, however, is meant to be shared in accordance with a scientifically devised noise-sharing protocol that dictates the use of different flight paths at various times over the course of the day. The negative impacts to the health and wellbeing of those that live directly under a flight path from prolonged exposure to incessant aircraft noise is well known. As such, the principle of noise sharing is one we should uphold. I was surprised to learn that aircraft noise at Sydney airport is not being shared as it should be. Instead, my community is bearing more than double the amount of air traffic and related noise than the agreed noise-sharing plan dictates. No wonder people are at their wits' end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who represents an electorate under the flight path, I hold a seat on the Sydney Airport Community Forum. This position enables me to elevate my community's concerns directly with those empowered to make a difference. That's exactly what my team and I are currently doing. But I stand here today to bring the government's attention to this issue and to urge the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to commission an urgent independent review into the management of aircraft noise at Sydney airport. My long-suffering community deserves nothing less.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:46</span>):  It's with pleasure that I provide an update to the House on some exciting progress on one of the biggest commitments I took to the 2022 election: the $10 million for the establishment of a mines grouting fund for Lake Macquarie. It's no secret that Lake Macquarie suburbs like Charlestown and Cardiff are home to some very old historical underground mines. For new development to safely occur at these sites, the mine voids need to be filled and remediated with cement grout. This can be very expensive, and developers often aren't sure how much grouting is needed, which makes it very hard for them to borrow money from the banks and invest in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where the Lake Macquarie Mines Grouting Fund will come in. It seeks to underwrite developers for the unpredictable cost of grouting above the capped rate, providing them with greater cost certainty, which gives their banks certainty as well. This will give businesses confidence to invest in new developments in our community and also help to address the housing crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I was proud to announce that stage 1 of establishing the Lake Macquarie Mines Grouting Fund was underway. Thanks to $2 million in funding from the Albanese Labor government, Lake Macquarie City Council is currently conducting scoping studies to fully determine the extent of the mine remediation needed, including a base remediation cost. That's anticipated to be completed by February next year. Then stage 2, the actual establishment of the mines grouting fund, will commence. This fund is expected to open for applications from the middle of 2025. This will have massive benefits for our region. Prior to the last election, Lake Macquarie's economic development corporation, Dantia, conducted analysis which showed that a grouting fund for Lake Macquarie would unlock 2½ thousand new jobs and accelerate $450 million of investment in eligible development applications in Charlestown alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Lake Macquarie Mines Grouting Fund will be successful because of what's happened in places like Newcastle. Newcastle had its own grouting fund. Around $2 million of funding was drawn upon for that program, and it stimulated over $3 billion of investment in the city. Let me repeat that: around $2 million from the Newcastle Mines Grouting Fund unlocked over $3 billion of investment in Newcastle. This fund will level the playing field for Lake Macquarie by giving the private sector confidence to invest in our region, which will help unlock our community's economic potential and help create jobs and housing. The Lake Macquarie Mines Grouting Fund will be good for developers, good for local jobs and good for addressing the current housing crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another election commitment I took to the last election—and it's fortuitous that the Minister for Communications is sitting next to me—was to help solve the mobile phone black spot issues in our community. Telstra has been awarded a contract to build towers on Lake Munmorah, Eleebana, Budgewoi, Halekulani and Jewells. I thank the minister for her cooperation on an important program for my community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Transport Oriented Development Program, 20,000 new dwellings are expected within 400 metres of Gordon, Killara, Lindfield and Roseville stations in 15 years. Within 400 metres of a train station or designated shopping area, apartment buildings of up to 21 metres in height will be permitted in areas zoned as high-density residential, medium-density residential and general residential. Between 400 and 800 metres away from a train station or designated shopping centre, apartment buildings of up to 16 metres will be permitted. In areas between 400 and 800 metres away from a train station or shopping centre, on any block larger than 500 square metres in size, the new rules will allow an existing freestanding home to be replaced with several terrace houses, each up to 9.5 metres in height, with multidwelling housing or with so-called 'manor houses'—small, two-storey apartment blocks. Duplexes can be built on any residential block as long as it's at least 450 square metres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 May, the New South Wales government provided each council with a five-year housing target, and the Ku-ring-gai Council's target was set at 7,600. There are several reasons to have concern about the process the New South Wales government has followed and the lack of appropriate weight it has attached to some very important considerations. One of them is heritage. Many suburbs near railway lines have housing stock which is well over 100 years old, reflecting the historic importance of railways in influencing patterns of development. The likely impact of the proposed changes on federation housing stock must be considered. This is a housing type which is distinctively Australian, representative of a vital stage of our history and of which there is a limited stock remaining—and, of that limited stock, a significant proportion is to be found in Ku-ring-gai. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many 'village' communities across metropolitan areas which have a distinctive local character, including many such communities in the electorate of Bradfield. These characters have developed over time, but that could now be at risk. There are also environmental considerations. High-density development can result in reduced tree cover, with consequences including higher localised temperatures, reduced habitat for native wildlife, more concrete cover and, hence, more water run-off and other detrimental environmental impacts. There's also the impact on parkland and bushland, because significant localised increases in population could adversely affect nearby national and other parks and areas of remnant natural bushland. Then there is the impact on local infrastructure in terms of demand for local sporting, recreational, parkland and other community facilities. It is important that these considerations are given proper weight in the planning processes.</span>

For many years, Khalsa Shaouni have shared their generous spirit with our community, going above and beyond to make our community a better place to live in. From their educational workshops to their cultural and charitable events, their work is a reminder to all of us of the importance of service to others, be it during the pandemic, when they prepared over 165,000 meals for those doing it tough, or during natural disasters, when they provided bottled water, hygiene essentials and blankets to those who have lost everything. The work they undertake is remarkable and a true example of Aussie mateship. I want to give a special thank you to Gurdarshan, Avtar and everyone else at Khalsa Shaouni for their hard work. The support they provide has become such an incredible pillar of strength within our community. I'd like to thank them also for welcoming the Prime Minister and me so warmly. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and this is especially true in Hawke. Local volunteers give up their time, effort, and skills to deliver critical programs that bring members of our community together. When you invest in volunteering, you change lives for the better. I'm happy to say that that's exactly what this Labor government is doing. I'm proud to share today that 35 local volunteer organisations have recently received a combined total of more than $60,000 from the Albanese Labor government in grant funding. This includes a $1,000 grant for the wonderful team at Pentland Calisthenics College, who I recently visited in Bacchus Marsh—keeping our youngest generations active and healthy while fostering a culture of self-confidence and teamwork. With this extra support they can expand their investment in their volunteers, delivering more CPR, first aid, mental health and skills training. </span>

I'd like to thank Laura for showing me around, and I thank all the great people at Crossroads Trading, T and K Support Services, Ballan Fresh Fruit and Veg, Springfields Garage and Ballan Local Butchers for taking the time to chat with me. It was great to hear firsthand about the current challenges facing local businesses in Hawke and how we as a government can continue to provide meaningful support. Whether you run a small business or community organisation or you're just proud to call Hawke home, our Labor government has got your back.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55</span>):  In the Prime Minister's election night speech, he spoke about how the government is looking out for all Australians and would ensure that no-one is left behind because 'we would always look after the disadvantaged and vulnerable'—those are the Prime Minister's words. How about looking after the disadvantaged and vulnerable in my electorate? In the 2024-25 grant funding round under the Information Linkages and Capacity Building program for Individual Capacity Building was quietly announced recently, but missing from this was funding for disability peer support organisations in the south-west of my electorate. The South West Autism Network, Down Syndrome WA and Developmental Disability WA were notified that they would not be receiving funding or that their funding would not be continuing. They cannot continue to provide their services to people and families in the south-west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These organisations share a long history of providing for our community, with over 80 years of combined service between them. We cannot underestimate how invaluable their support is, not only for the most vulnerable in our communities and their families but their loved ones, carers and support networks as well. They were given just five weeks notice that their funding wouldn't be continued beyond 30 June. They provide compassionate and caring support, direction and advocacy to hundreds of people in need each week. Without these, service times and wait times will blow out and/or regional people will have to go to the city for support. Advocacy WA, the only organisation with ongoing funding, currently has waiting times of over six weeks. Without local providers, these times will compound and many will suffer. It's appalling that regional Australians continue to bear the consequences of the government's city based priorities, especially in the health space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, the south-west is seeing changes to the priority allocation of GPs, making it harder and more expensive to see doctors and allied health professionals There is a loss of birthing services throughout the south-west at St John of God and at the Margaret River hospital, Centrelink processing times continue to soar and there are record housing shortages and ongoing labour shortages in our region. So, Prime Minister, if you genuinely care about those most vulnerable and want to ensure that no-one will be left behind, the South West Autism Network's ethos is to fill the support gaps in our community. Can you please let them do it? It has done an incredible job with only $460,000 a year in funding. They need to be able to continue this work. I plead with the government and the minister to keep funding these invaluable services. Our most vulnerable need them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  I'm very happy to be on my feet today to advise that the Edith Cowan University Health Centre in Yanchep is due to officially open soon. This new project is jointly funded by Edith Cowan University, the Australian federal government and the Western Australian state government. The Australian federal government will provide integrated multidisciplinary health services to meet the current and future healthcare needs of this rapidly growing northern corridor of the Pearce electorate, which is one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two parts to this project, with the health centre based over two co-located buildings. The highly anticipated Yanchep East building will be opening soon, and a new build planned for the second site will open in 2026. Contained in the ECU Health Centre Yanchep West 2023 stakeholder and community consultation report, we're advised that the mix of health services required fall into two main categories: (1) clinical based services including sonography, childhood and maternal health, cancer treatment, mental health, and chronic disease management; and (2) counselling based and social services to service gaps in Yanchep and surrounding areas in social support groups, aged-care services, home based service delivery and community health. This is highly indicative of the needs of the most northern corridor, with both its ageing population and influx of newer, younger families. Access to health services that cater for all age groups is critical given the significant population growth which is projected over the next two decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report outlined the need for additional child health services, to support the growing number of families residing in Yanchep and nearby surrounds. This includes pre- and postnatal care, development checks for infants and children, child psychology, early intervention programs to support parents and, generally, family based support programs to build resilience in children and their families. The Albanese Labor government is committed to providing urgent care clinics, cheaper medicines and accessible, affordable healthcare services, which is evidenced by our investment in the bulk-billing incentive to help free up local doctors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Cobie Rudd, from Edith Cowan University, was a driving force on this project. I know because I was also involved. I would like to acknowledge the commitment, dedication, hard work and advocacy of the whole team. My congratulations and thanks go to Edith Cowan University, who have turned this vision into a reality, and to the two final-year public health students, who each completed a 75-hour work integrated learning placement working on the 2023 consultation process. The Edith Cowan University Health Centre Yanchep is indeed a welcome initiative, and my community eagerly looks forward to the official opening. I would like to sincerely thank everybody who has been involved in this project.</span>

Shooting these horses from helicopters under the guise of environmentalism is as callous as it is unnecessary. In some cases, horses have been shot as many as—wait for it—17 times and left to bleed out. In some cases, mares with foals afoot have been shot. The foals are left to starve, and the mares have been left to die a cruel and slow death. It is so unnecessary.</span>

Patrick Byrnes of Wagga Wagga comments: 'Shooting an animal up to 17 times, even in the mouth, and letting foals starve—those right from the bottom to the top must take responsibility for their inhumane actions and be prosecuted for animal cruelty. This includes the RSPCA.' Patrick Leary of Coolamon talks about the descendants of our amazing warhorses, the waler. Maria Flinn of Ladysmith says they are 'part of our Australian country history and heritage'. Then we have Linda Pocock of Wagga Wagga saying: 'Animal cruelty—this is so sad. They should be protected. Deer and pigs will be doing more damage than the brumbies.' Georgina Gorman is very supportive of efforts being made as well.</span>

They're using these exaggerated numbers as an excuse to shoot, out of helicopters, thousands of horses. The same people who are saying this is a good thing are then down at Flemington, standing out the front on Melbourne Cup Day—the first Tuesday in November—and saying, 'How cruel is this—horses running around a track.'

Indeed, we've got the RSPCA, who checked a farm at Downside at Wagga Wagga twice and made no attempt to say that anything was wrong even though there were hundreds of horse bones piled up there.

In the May budget we announced $1.9 billion to fund road upgrades and congestion-busting transport across Western Sydney. In Greenway, upgrades to Garfield Road East and Richmond Road through to the M7 will improve safety and traffic flow. This means less time stuck in traffic and more time spent with family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thousands of residents continue to move into the north-west growth area and call it home. The Blacktown local government area population is expected to grow to almost half a million people by 2041. To keep pace, the Albanese government is investing $147.5 million to plan better roads and public transport across Western Sydney. Labor is able to plan and deliver for the future because we cleaned up the infrastructure pipeline mess left by the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to the 2015 state election, the New South Wales Liberals promised to build a hospital in Rouse Hill to cater for the growing population of the north-west. But, in 2019, the commitment was revised to build a hospital in name only—a glorified medical centre without an emergency department—and locals were rightly outraged. They rallied around a community driven campaign to convince the former New South Wales Liberal government to change this ridiculous situation. Now, the New South Wales Labor government is getting on with the job of delivering this 300-bed hospital with contemporary healthcare facilities and an emergency ward. The new hospital will adopt the New South Wales Labor government's full campus model, which incorporates health worker accommodation and childcare services. Construction will support an estimated 1,200 jobs and thousands more indirectly. Critically, it will bring health care closer to communities around Rouse Hill, Talwong, Schofield, The Ponds and Riverstone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well-planned infrastructure builds opportunities, aspiration and community, and it is Labor who is delivering this for the good people who call north-west Sydney their home. As the member for Greenway, I'll continue to advocate for the roads, critical infrastructure and other essential services that our communities deserve.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  Last week, as the shadow minister for Western Sydney, I spoke at the National Growth Areas Alliance conference, which gathered in my electorate of Lindsay. We had mayors and council representatives from many councils across New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. I proudly represent most of Penrith City Council, the LGA, in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penrith, like many local government areas in greater Western Sydney, is the perfect example of a growth area which is in need of funding to ensure infrastructure keeps pace, from our multigenerational farms in the south of the electorate, like Luddenham, to landowners in the north across Londonderry, the manufacturing hubs of Emu Plains in the east and St Marys in the west, and many families are living in the suburbs in between—Caddens, Jamisontown, Glenmore Park and Cranbrook, just to name a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is like many growth areas on the fringe of the city but not quite in the bush, with more people who have gone to TAFE and made a life from their trade or the small business than those who have attended university. We struggle with public transport, roads and infrastructure and the need to upgrade local community halls, which is why it is so important to keep those local funding grants going. Housing approvals are constant, and our schools and hospitals are starting to feel immense pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is some positive that comes with this change, and we know there are many opportunities ahead. There will be Western Sydney International Airport and the surrounding aerotropolis. The aerotropolis will be home to an advanced manufacturing hub with jobs of the future for so many locals, if everything goes to plan, and we have all levels of government and industry working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Lindsay, the Institute of Applied Technology for Construction at Kingswood has opened in partnership with TAFE New South Wales, CPB Contractors and Western Sydney University, which I attended. We have so many growth opportunities but, as I said, infrastructure is holding us back, which is why we find it quite extraordinary that the minister for infrastructure conducted a 90-day review which took a lot longer than that and then cut multiple projects across the electorate and across Western Sydney. It's not just about my patch in Lindsay. There are other communities impacted as well. South-western Sydney communities and those in the north-west of Sydney across Blacktown and the hills have seen big increases in their housing targets, and they need infrastructure to support this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, of course, need better connectivity across the west, which is why even the New South Wales Labor government found it odd that the federal government had taken away their investment for the M7-M12 interchange, and they haven't put it back. The whole community doesn't understand why the Albanese Labor government is playing politics with infrastructure in Western Sydney, and we certainly deserve better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I rise today to talk about the people in my community—people that I have been visiting at sporting events across the last few weeks. I've been to the Werribee Football Club. I've been to the Wyndhamvale Football Club. I've been to the Tarneit Titans football club. I've been to the Hoppers Crossing Netball Association. I've spent some time with the Wyndham Netball Association and the Hoppers Crossing Netball Association representative teams at an enormous event at our recreation centre, Eagle Stadium, recently. And what people have been talking to me about is how tough they're doing it—how tough it is in their budgets at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be able to have these conversations with them and pleased to be able to share with our community today the good news around a 3.7 per cent pay rise for the lowest-paid wage earners in our country which will mean an enormous amount to many in the community that I represent. Of course, we're all looking forward to 1 July, when the 95,000 taxpayers in the seat of Lalor will get a tax cut. That is a tax cut for every taxpayer in Lalor, and the average tax cut will be $1,441 a year. That's because Labor is committed to people earning more and keeping more of what they earn. Our budget also announced $300 in energy bill relief to assist those families and households across the city of Wyndham and in the seat of Lalor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud of the responsible economic management that we're seeing from the Albanese Labor government, from our Treasurer, Jim Chalmers. We're driving down those deficits and giving surpluses in our economy. We're getting wages moving, and the 3.7 per cent pay rise is emblematic of that. That's on top of the 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, many of whom live and work in my community. It's incredibly important to think about that. It's about the HECS-HELP relief for the 19,000 people in my electorate who have a HECS-HELP loan. It's about the cheaper medicines. It's about the rent assistance and the fact that we have 8,000 households who have had an increase in their rent assistance of 40 per cent across the two years we've been in government. This is a government that cares about the people doing it tough and is committed to responsible economic management. This government is doing the things to help people get through the tough times but is keeping the Australian economy on the right track.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Water</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I am so very proud to get up and talk about the environment and water budgets, because no government in Australia's history has done more to support action on the environment, climate change and water than this government, including in this budget. Over coming years, we will invest more than $9 billion in the environment and around $5 billion in water. The Albanese Labor government is doing more than ever to protect our natural world, to fix more of what's been damaged and to care for the places we love. We continue to invest in the environment and water at record levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're expanding our Antarctic science program and spending more than ever to support the wonderful work of Antarctic science. On water, we're taking real action, with record investments in water infrastructure, including to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full—and I know my South Australian colleagues are very interested in this—and to support basin communities as we make these changes. We're investing well over $500 million to manage our precious water resources. I can't disclose some of the dollar figures, for commercial reasons, as we, of course, will be buying water in coming years. This budget locks in an extra half a billion dollars for Antarctic science, bringing spending to record levels, and $353 million on our Nature Positive Plan to establish our first federal Environment Protection Agency and also Environment Information Australia and to establish the Nature Repair Market. We're also using that investment to speed up environmental approvals for all the projects we know will make a real difference to the Australian economy, like renewable energy projects, transmission and critical minerals projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got $65 million extra for threatened species research, $29 million for cultural heritage reform and remediating Jabiru, and $23 million to develop a national circular economy framework and to tackle problematic waste streams. We know how concerned Australians are about plastics, in particular, entering our environment in record amounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. In recent years we've doubled funding to better look after our national parks, like Kakadu and Uluru. That is a very necessary response to years of neglect from the previous government. We've protected an extra 40 million hectares of Australia's beautiful land and sea. An area bigger than Germany has been added to the Macquarie Island Marine Park. And, of course, there'll be more to come as we announce our new Indigenous Protected Areas, for example. I'd remind the House that the tripling of the Macquarie Island Marine Park was the biggest addition to conservation anywhere in the world in 2023—bigger than anything else that was done anywhere in the world. We've kept the Great Barrier Reef off the World Heritage in-danger list by better protecting it with a $1.2 billion investment and the doubling of money for the marine scientists who look after it. The work that's being done to better protect and keep the water that's flowing onto the reef in a better state—for example, reducing the nitrogen loads—has been quite transformational. And we're working to provide World Heritage listing for more of our incredible natural treasures, like the Murujuga Cultural Landscape in Western Australia, Cape York, the Flinders Ranges and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very interested to hear what the member for Riverina was saying about feral horses recently. We are absolutely determined to make sure that feral animals, whether horses, pigs, goats or cats, are properly and humanely dealt with, because they are having a huge impact on our native species. This is a choice between allowing introduced species—feral animals and weeds—to take over our natural landscapes or standing up for Australian plants and animals and landscapes and protecting them from these invasive species. It is literally a choice between the feral horses and the platypuses, echidnas, bilbies and quolls—whether we protect their environments and help them to survive. We're doubling the number of Indigenous Rangers to make sure our special places are better cared for. I will continue my remarks shortly.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for the Environment and Water here today. With regard to her opening remarks, I'm sure her South Australian colleagues are very pleased with the fact that her government is taking productive water that provides employment and amenity from the northern basin in my electorate in attempt to gain votes in South Australia, despite the fact that in many cases they are terminal streams and they can't be delivered!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to water buybacks, Minister, we know that in the Macquarie and Gwydir valleys the northern basin review showed that they'd been over-recovered, largely because of the purchase Senator Wong made in the previous Labor government from the Twynam Pastoral Company in those two valleys. The review showed that the Macquarie Valley was about 38½ gigalitres over-recovered, and, from memory, I think the Gwydir is about nine gigalitres over-recovered. Can the minister tell the House, is that water going to be returned to the productive pool to enable those communities to actually have some sort of economic advantage? Or is that water going to be rolled into the 450 gigalitres that wasn't part of the plan that came in at the 2013 election? The minister's shaking his head. I should point out I did vote for the plan originally. I did not vote for the 450 gigalitres. It was not part of the plan. One of the misconceptions that gets put in this place is that the 450 was part of the plan. It is not. What does the minister intend to do with that over-recovered water?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to Wilcannia, I'm sure the minister is well aware of the issue with the new weir. The previous government allocated $15 million and the state government allocated $15 million. Last year, before Christmas, the state government in New South Wales changed the design of that weir so that it's no longer going to raise the water level by an extra metre, despite the fact that the local community, the local land council, the floodplain graziers and the Central Darling Shire Council are all on a unity ticket for the need for this. We hear a lot of words in this place about our care and love and support for Indigenous communities. This is a project that will actually incredibly increase the amenity of that community by giving them a more reliable water supply. Don't get me wrong; I understand it's a state decision. My question is: has the New South Wales government approached the Commonwealth with more funding to build that weir to its original height? If they have, how much money have they asked for? If that were the case, if the New South Wales government did request more funding, would the minister be prepared to support that project?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some clutching at straws in the briefings I've had around environmental impacts of going higher. This will not take the river outside the bank. In actual fact, the normal rise and fall of the river due to flows is probably higher than that extra metre. There was an attempt to find some Indigenous heritage items which did not, and so it does seem that there is some form of policy directive within the New South Wales bureaucracy around putting weirs in rivers. I'd like the minister's opinion on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to buybacks in general, how much of the 450 gigalitres that the minister has promised to get is now removing the need for the triple bottom line with the environmental, social and economic disadvantage being removed from that? How much of the 450 gigalitres is the minister hoping to purchase from the northern basin, despite the fact that from the top end of my electorate you'd need to purchase 16 megalitres of water to get one megalitre of water across the border into South Australia?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  Like all Australians, I'm interested to hear from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy about how the budget continues to deliver what's required to support Australia's energy transition. That's because people in my community are in no doubt about the importance of bringing our energy system into the 21st century, which has to occur if we want to avoid missing out on the massive opportunities of a global energy and industrial transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that's why this budget follows previous work on legislating net zero by 2050 by funding the essential transmission upgrades necessary to reach 82 per cent renewables by 2030, through the Rewiring the Nation program, with new investment in renewable hydrogen. I understand the budget includes $6.7 billion over the decade for a new production tax incentive of $2 per kilogram starting in 2027-28 and then $2 billion for a new round of the successful Hydrogen Headstart Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable hydrogen on a commercial scale at the right price can deliver a triple benefit: firstly, as an option for renewable energy storage; secondly, as a means of exporting renewable energy; and, thirdly, as a renewable transport fuel, particularly for areas like shipping. So I would certainly be interested in hearing from the minister about how Australia can be a leader in renewable hydrogen, allowing us to convert our world-leading sun and wind resources into a new zero-emission energy export trade. That's what we mean by 'the potential for Australia to become a renewable energy superpower'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the only energy plan we've heard from those opposite in response to the budget is in the form of a deep and delusional desire to go nuclear, and I would be interested in hearing the minister's views on that. I'm not sure you can call the coalition's approach a plan, because we still don't know how many nuclear reactors there will be, where they'll go, when they'll be delivered, who will build them or how much they'll cost, but presumably we're going to hear that pretty soon. Nuclear energy is not part of our plan, because all the evidence, expertise and inquiries over several decades have made it clear that nuclear just doesn't make sense for Australia. It's the most expensive form of new energy generation, it takes ages and ages to build, it's fundamentally uncommercial and uninsurable, and it presents grave risks to environmental and human health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having noted the false and misleading claims the opposition have made in relation to the health of the nuclear industry worldwide, I think it's worth considering the facts courtesy of the most recent <span style="font-style:italic;">World nuclear industry status report</span>. Nuclear power peaked as a proportion of global energy back in 1996. It's now half of its peak level. The number of nuclear reactors peaked in 2002. In the last 20 years, there were 99 reactor startups and 105 reactor closures. Forty-nine of those start-ups were in China, so, if you remove China, you have a net decline of 55 reactors over the last two decades. It is worth noting, too, that solar alone outstripped nuclear energy in China for the first time in 2022 and that non-hydro renewables in China already produce three times the energy of nuclear in that country. In France, which is often cited as the leading example of nuclear energy reliance, total generation last year dropped below the level achieved in 1990. In the US, the largest producer of nuclear energy, generation declined last year to its lowest level in 25 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the commercial viability of nuclear projects, it's worth noting that only three countries build nuclear reactors for other countries: Russia, France and South Korea. The French constructor EDF was renationalised last year after record losses and massive debt put it on the brink of bankruptcy. The South Korean constructor is already a state owned utility, and in 2022 it booked a record US$25 billion loss. Of course, in Japan, which last year began a 30-year process of discharging contaminated water from the Fukushima disaster into the ocean, there are still 27,000 people displaced and the government has estimated the clean-up cost is estimated at US$223 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the international comparison between nuclear and renewables, 2022 saw a record US$495 billion invested in renewables, a 35 per cent increase from the previous year and representing 74 per cent of all new energy investment. New nuclear in that year only amounted to $US35 billion. Renewables added 348 gigawatts of new capacity; nuclear added 4.3 gigawatts in net operating capacity. After 70 years, nuclear now accounts for 9.2 per cent of global energy, yet non-hydro renewables are already at 14.4 per cent. Does that make nuclear sound like a technology that's on the rise? Absolutely not. It's the opposite. Nuclear is 70-year-old technology in decline, and I'd ask the minister: how ridiculous and harmful is this secret, delusional plan?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  Two hundred and seventy-five dollars—I'm sure the Minister for Climate Change and Energy would like Australians to forget that figure. But we can't, because it is etched in our memories, having been said almost 100 times, and in our hearts, which are breaking across the country right now because of this broken promise. In response to a journalist asking if the Minister for Climate Change and Energy was going to be able to achieve the $275 reduction in energy prices, the minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well, of course, that was what we indicated would be the impact by 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're now in 2024, and prices are nowhere near dropping by $275. In fact, Western Sydney residents, where I'm from, need the Default Market Offer's reference price for the next financial year to drop by more than $1,000 to reach the Albanese Labor government's promise. Instead, Endeavour energy customers on a controlled loan will pay almost $3,000 a year for their electricity. This is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ausgrid customers across the Central Coast, the Hunter and parts of Sydney have seen a cumulative price increase of more than 30 per cent under this government in just two years. Essential energy users across regional New South Wales in Albury, Grafton, Dubbo and Taree have had an increase of around $650 on their bills. South-east Queenslanders who use Energex are paying almost 40 per cent more on their bills, and South Australian households are paying 32 per cent more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher energy costs are sending some families absolutely broke, and they are in distress. Tens of thousands of households are spiralling further into the cost-of-living abyss thanks to the Albanese Labor government's energy policies. Hundreds of families are going onto hardship payments with energy providers each week. I understand there is a 59 per cent increase on hardship payments for electricity and a 70 per cent increase for those on hardship payments with gas providers. These are alarming figures. Does the minister admit that a $275 reduction in energy prices, as promised when they came into government, will not be realised by 2025? Will the minister let this place know whether or not the government's $300 rebate for household energy bills is an attempt to hoodwink the Australian public and try to make them forget about their original commitment on energy prices?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many factories in my electorate with energy bills up 100 per cent. They are under threat of closing. These are industries that we need for our sovereign capability for our manufacturing future. There is a small business in Lindsay that has had its energy bills more than double to $27,500. Minister, how is the $325 rebate they might receive going to assist small and family businesses in the long run when their energy bills have gone up so much since the Albanese Labor government took office?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government made an announcement last year regarding the Household Energy Upgrades Fund. Minister, has any of the $1.3 billion of funding gone out the door for the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, and, if yes, how much? The fund was meant to support around 110,000 households to lower their energy bills. Minister, how many households have been supported so far under the fund? Around 60,000 social housing properties were to be upgraded and save one-third of their energy consumption through the upgrades per year. How many social homes have been assisted, Minister, and can the government produce any power bills from these properties that demonstrate they have saved around one-third on their power bills?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the government's renewables-only energy approach is sending so many families into financial hardship. We need a government that will get more supply into the market right now to ensure cheaper bills for households. We need more gas approved and more gas for domestic consumption in this critical time for Australians. We've seen the Australian Energy Market Operator release its latest <span style="font-style:italic;">Electricity statement of opportunities</span>, which highlighted severe reliability concerns in the domestic energy market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, as the grid wobbles, will this Albanese Labor government concede that its all-eggs-in-one-basket approach towards specific renewables is not working? Everyday Australians across Western Sydney are struggling with the costs of energy. Our older Australians are worried about paying their next bills turning on the heater at night through this winter. Action must be taken. We need reliable, cheap power now to keep our manufacturers making Aussie-made. We need reliable, cheap power to ensure families can keep the lights on this winter for their kids.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I'm delighted to take this opportunity to provide the House with a brief update on some of the measures that the government has implemented in the climate change and energy space since we last gathered. I'll deal firstly with electricity, which the honourable member for Lindsay referred to. I might start by referring to the welcome release yesterday of AEMO's winter 2024 outlook, which hasn't been mentioned, as far as I've seen, by any member opposite since it was released. It notes the situation going into winter:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similar operating conditions to last winter are expected this year for Australia's energy systems …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is according to the Australian Energy Market Operator. It goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Months of planning with industry, governments and network businesses has gone into preparing the energy systems for the winter ahead—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which is of course true. Importantly, they go on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a significant uplift in the availability of existing generation going into this winter since last year, as well as an expected 600 MW of new battery energy storage systems and nearly 1,300 MW of new renewable generation connecting to the NEM to meet demand this winter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very good report in terms of winter readiness. Those opposite like to make quite alarmist and dishonest representations regarding our energy system. The member for Fairfax said that there would be blackouts last summer. There was no blackout caused by a lack of energy generation. Of course, every system has to deal with transmission towers being knocked over in cyclones and other incidents. That happens, regardless of whoever is in government. But, in terms of a lack of energy reserves, we saw no blackout last summer. Now the member for Fairfax is predicting blackouts next summer. He'll presumably just continue to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We prefer to get on with the job of ensuring the transition in the energy system and ensuring reliability as we do so, because renewable energy is a reliable form of energy when you compare it to coal fired power generation, which is increasingly ageing and increasingly unreliable. That's no fault of the operators of those coal fired power stations or the people who work very hard in them; they're just very old pieces of kit, increasingly. We see a substantial period of time in which we have unexpected outages in our coal fired power generation, but I'm pleased that last year, AEMO approved 6,817 megawatts of new connections—an increase of more than 2,000 megawatts from the previous financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to hear the member for Lindsay say that we need more supply, because we do. It's partly because, under the last decade, we saw four gigawatts of dispatchable energy leave the grid and only one gigawatt come in. They had the UNGI scheme, which should have stood for 'unfortunately no generation involved' because it delivered not a gigawatt, not a megawatt, not a watt, not an electron into the system. That's what we saw with the 22 energy policies of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fremantle asked me to comment on nuclear. All I will say in relation to nuclear is that it is very much the wrong and risky answer for Australia. Nuclear power plants take a very long time to build, and they are very, very expensive to build. Why you would do that, when you compare it to renewable energy, which is much cheaper to build and faster to build, is beyond me, but that's up to those opposite. They might one day get around to actually releasing a policy, and them we might be able to debate that policy. It was promised 12 weeks ago. It was promised before the budget. In hindsight—I've checked the record—to be fair to those opposite, they didn't say which budget. Maybe it wasn't meant to be this year's.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I might touch on some other matters across the Climate Change and Energy portfolio. I'm very pleased to report to the House, as I think honourable members will recall, that last sitting week the House and the Senate passed the new vehicle efficiency standards—a long overdue reform in the too-hard basket for 20 years. Transport emissions are our third-biggest source of emissions and are on track to become our biggest source of emissions if we don't act. Because we are getting our emissions down from electricity and industry, transport will rocket up and become our largest source of emissions if we don't have the right policy framework. The new vehicle efficiency standards are a very, very big part of that framework. They were promised by the coalition when they were in office. The coalition then squibbed it and couldn't deliver it. I was disappointed that the coalition didn't support our package, given that they had tried something very similar when they were in office. The opposition has become so negative that they oppose not only our policies but also their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased with the progress we're making. We have much more to do. We have the six sector plans well under development. We have a new net zero 2050 plan well under development, which will replace the previous government's technology assumption that somehow something magical in the future will get us to net zero. We'll continue that work. I thank the government members and the crossbench for consistently supporting that work thus far.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I acknowledge the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, who's in the Federation Chamber with us here today. The minister has just raised a few points. Firstly, he spoke about electricity. What was interesting though was that he is celebrating the fact that a report has come out where the operator thinks there may not be blackouts this winter. It goes to the precarious nature of our electricity grid that we have the minister of this country coming into the chamber and celebrating the fact that, in what is a developed country, the lights might stay on. That's how bad this has become. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know, though, that only two weeks ago the operator put out a different report, saying that there is a heightened risk of blackouts this coming summer. The minister was silent about the operator's view in that regard. The minister continues to do this. He will deflect and cherrypick data in the hope of telling a good story. He suggests that everything is going swimmingly well with regard to supply. But we know that all major energy experts in this country are calling out the problem we have with a lack of supply, which not only risks the lights going out but is, of course, driving prices up. He talks about wanting the coalition to release its energy policy, but I note that the Labor Party released its Powering Australia plan in the December before the election, giving the Australian public very little time to consider it. By the way, the modelling there suggested a $275 reduction in household power bills, which I'll come to shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, there is the vehicle efficiency standard, to which the minister just referred. Again, it totally missed the opportunity to get the balance right between price, choice and emissions reduction, and that is why we have seen Australians very concerned about the inevitable increase in the purchase price of vehicles. This is something, again, that the minister has failed to furnish modelling on to suggest otherwise. The only modelling he has furnished suggests electricity prices will continue to come down for those who do rightly opt for the choice, if they wish, to have EVs. That's the only modelling that has suggested that electricity prices are going down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've now had two years of the Albanese Labor government, and the dangerous state of the climate and energy agenda suggests things are only going from bad to worse. A $275 reduction in household power bills was promised by the Labor Party ahead of the last election. We now know, because the regulator has revealed the prices of electricity for next year, that some households will be paying up to $1,000 more than what Labor had promised them. To this day, this minister in the chamber has refused to acknowledge what was an untruth, and he continues to perpetrate and peddle a false prophecy of those prices coming down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they promised a reliable grid, more stability. But what we saw—again, the operator suggests we might have blackouts as soon as this summer—only two weeks ago, was an extension of the largest coal-fired power station in New South Wales. Why? It's because this minister's policy has not delivered and the reliability of the grid is in great danger. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, we have renewables—82 per cent renewables by 2030. Even the most fervent supporters of renewables suggest that that is running at less than half the electric vehicles target, which is 89 per cent of all new sales of vehicles by 2030 being electric vehicles. His own department suggests that it will be 29 per cent. Social licence—we have 92 per cent of people in regional communities saying that they are not happy with the community consultation under this government for the rollout of transmission lines and renewables. There's the 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030. Nobody, other than the minister himself, thinks that this is a possibility. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I would like to thank ministers Plibersek and Bowen for the work being done in the environment and energy portfolios, noting that more has been done under this government than under any previous, particularly in the last decade. People in my electorate of Boothby and those in South Australia more broadly are very concerned about water security and the impact climate change is having on our state. In South Australia we normally see the break of the season on Anzac Day. Anzac Day comes and goes and then it rains. But not this year. Following on from a rainless February and a largely dry March, where we only had three millimetres of rain recorded, the February-to-April period was the driest year since 1923 and—pardon the pun—it was a hot topic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australians are very interested to see the Murray-Darling Basin Plan delivered in full, particularly the environmental flows. We are at the bottom of the river system and we are dependent on our upstream colleagues for water quality and water quantity. South Australia relies on the river Murray for drinking water from towns on the river to as far away as Adelaide and even onto the York and Eyre peninsulas. We also rely on the Murray for agriculture, from irrigators in the Riverland right through to the Murraylands and the mouth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend Sally runs Mundoo Island Station in the Murray mouth at Goolwa, a cattle and sheep station. The farmers on the last station on the Murray Darling River system have long been an environmentalist, as many farmers are, monitoring the water quality around the islands. The Murray mouth gets all the nutrients and contaminants from the entire river system along with the diminished flows, leading to water that is too concentrated to sustain life. Water quality is not only important for the environment, keeping in mind the Murray mouth is one of the 16 Ramsar wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin, so an important environment, but Sally is monitoring water quality for their stock. Water that is too full of concentrates is not usable for the cattle, sheep and horses on the station. I'm aware of some of the off-farm water-saving projects undertaken in Boothby and I'm keen to know what more can be done in metropolitan Adelaide to contribute to the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan through managing demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to see funding in the budget to ensure that projects being funded under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan are evidence based and produce results. South Australia has been hard done by, by previous Liberal governments, federal and state, undermining the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, prioritising eastern states over South Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is about sharing a scarce valuable resource of water between the states. We have heard today they are doubling down on disadvantaging South Australian farmers, communities and residents. I was also pleased to see more funding to ensure integrity in the Murray-Darling Basin Plain system and rebuild trust. Water is very much the lifeblood of our country and nowhere more so than South Australia, the driest state in the driest continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to climate change, a number of my coastal councils have recently been briefed on sea temperatures, predicted sea level rise and the implications for coastal infrastructure and suburbs. Many of the suburbs of Adelaide are built on former sand dunes and, while they have lovely views of spectacular beaches, they are also very vulnerable to sea level rise. There are parts of Adelaide that already have seawater coming up onto the streets through the storm drains when there is a king tide, particularly if there is a storm at the same time. I personally have worked at the council that deployed sandbags as a regular exercise to protect houses and infrastructure when a king tide was predicted. I have to note that I was not personally deploying sandbags.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A one-in-100-year flood sees significant parts of Adelaide predicted to go underwater through coastal inundation. As we have seen interstate, one-in-100-year floods seem to be coming more and more frequently. Having seen recent media reports about the Brunt Ice Shelf and the retreat of glaciers worldwide, seawater infiltrating under ice caps and an increased rate of melting, I was interested to see the budget allocation for expanding the Antarctic science program and the voyage to the Denman Glacier. I'd like to know from the minister a bit more about the types of scientific studies being done on the glacier, what is being done to better understand what is happening in Antarctica with ice melts and what the expected outcomes of the scientific expedition are expected to be.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  This budget delivers the next stage in the Albanese government's plan to deliver a profitable, productive future for Australia's agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector. Over the last couple of years, this sector has risen to new heights. The gross value of Australian farms, fisheries and forests is now $90.8 billion—the third-highest on record. This is due to the hard work of Australia's farmers, fishers and foresters, as well as other workers in those industries and the entire agricultural supply chain. That work is of course supported by a government that understands the importance of an industry that feeds us, clothes us and generates enormous wealth for our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the world changing around us, we can't rest on our laurels. In the previous two budgets, we've laid the groundwork to protect and to grow this sector through record investments in priority areas. This includes funding Australia's first-ever sustainable biosecurity funding model and rescuing a biosecurity budget that had been badly damaged by ongoing cuts. Additionally, we've now pumped in a billion new dollars to protect this industry from pests and disease. It includes rebuilding the agricultural workforce after its collapse through COVID-19. There is more to do, but a lot has happened already. It includes fixing the structural deficit that was left behind for us in the agriculture department's funding and restoring trade links that were shredded or diversifying into new ones. It includes investing serious money to improve the traceability of sheep and goats, and supporting our fisheries sector through country of origin labelling that has long been called for as well as investing significantly in the forestry sector so it modernises for the future. We are delivering real results in partnership with industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having done those things in the previous two budgets, we can now really get moving on helping the sector to mitigate, and adapt to, climate change. The budget takes the next step forward on what is arguably the biggest long-term challenge facing the sector, as well as being a massive opportunity. I'm of course talking about how we secure a sustainable future. The truth is that farmers and Australians living in rural and regional Australia face increasingly severe impacts of climate change. The truth is that, without intervention, things will get worse. Global temperatures are higher now than they have ever been in history, and it is costing our farmers every single day. Drought is now impacting farmers in Western Australia, Tasmania and elsewhere. ABARES has conservatively estimated that on average farmers have lost more than $30,000 per annum due to climate change over the last 20 years, with that figure expected to rise. The recent <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">g2050 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">scenario</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> report</span> by the CSIRO highlighted the need for industry to adapt to climate change to continue its growth trajectory. Bizarrely, we still see some—including some who claim to speak for farmers in parliament—try to paint any action on climate change as being risky for agribusiness. In my view, the bigger risk is doing nothing. That's why the centrepiece of the ag budget was nearly $520 million to support programs and initiatives in a rejuvenated future drought fund. Australians all understand that, when it comes to drought, it's a case of 'when', not 'if'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher rainfall in recent years has allowed some relief in much of the country, but not in all of it. As I say, we are already seeing drought impacts on some parts of the country right now. But also right now we are providing support to farmers and to rural communities who are experiencing drought, including through the farm household allowance, concessional loans, rural financial counselling, mental health support and the tax incentives that have allowed farmers to put away nearly $6 billion in farm management deposits that they can draw on through the tough times. But we also need to do more to prepare for drought, not just respond to it—not just have those sorts of supports in place when a drought arises. That's why the rejuvenated Future Drought Fund will provide for 10 on-ground programs with a much stronger focus on broader climate resilience, greater public benefit through wider sharing of what works, support for longer term trials, and a new program to assist First Nations communities deal with drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, longer and more frequent droughts are only one example of what we're likely to see as a result of climate change. The ongoing battle against a changing climate will be fought on many fronts. The Albanese Labor government recognises the need to do our part. We have an incredible opportunity to bring government and industry together to chart a lower emissions and more sustainable future for Australia's ag sector. Our work on these issues has accelerated over the last 12 months, particularly through the development of the ag and land sector decarbonisation plan. We're using this budget to make some down payments on the direction that's emerged from our widespread consultation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  In my electorate of Dawson, we have over 1,500 farmers and farm managers. We are the biggest sugarcane-growing region in the whole of Australia. We produce the beautiful Bowen mangoes. We have massive horticultural crops. The Bowen and Burdekin food bowls produce tomatoes, capsicums, beans, corn and a whole lot more, which feed the whole nation. That's not to mention the beef producers who call my electorate home. That's why, when the Albanese Labor government keeps coming for my people and for my farmers, things stop being political and start being personal. Each and every time I think things can't get any worse for our farmers, those on the other side prove me wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's latest brainchild is what they're calling the 'biosecurity protection levy'. This new levy, which was one of the most appalling take-outs of last year's budget and which was rejigged in the lead-up to this one, essentially amounts to a new $150 million fresh food tax on the men and women who grow our nation's food and fibre. It is a tax on our hardworking, underappreciated and undersupported farmers, who supply this country with the food and fibre that we need to sustain life. It is a tax on the individuals and families who make their livelihoods working the land and who support our economy. It is a tax on the same individuals and families who are being ripped off at every turn by supply chains, by Mother Nature, by the supermarkets and now by the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government will tell you they support our farmers, that they deserve their respect, that they deserve a government that listens to their concerns and acts on them, and that we need to ensure that our agriculture survives. So why, Minister, did you and your government decide to bring in a policy to tax our Australian farmers for the biosecurity risk posed by their international competitors? Under this current Labor government, our primary industries and our farmers are under threat. No other country in the world taxes their own farmers for the biosecurity risk posed by international imports—none at all. This current Albanese Labor government is treating our farmers with contempt. It's risking our food security, and it's weakening the future of Australian agriculture. The Prime Minister said, 'No-one will be left behind; everyone gets a fair go.' Where is the fair go for our farmers and their families? This government is not listening, and they're not acting in the best interests of regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My farmers are hurting right now. Our people are hurting, and our nation is hurting. It all starts with the primary industries that Minister Watt is so intent on damaging. We all know the importance of sustainably funding biosecurity into the future, but taxing our primary producers is not the answer. Right now, our Aussie farmers are in the fight of their lives. If they lose this fight, we all lose. I can assure our agriculture sector that the federal coalition stands shoulder to shoulder with our farmers. We will fight to get rid of this outrageous tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year the government rammed the legislation to establish the biosecurity protection levy through the House of Representatives. It passed, despite opposition from the coalition and the crossbench. Only Labor MPs supported it. Now the legislation is stuck in the Senate, and farmers and industry groups have been left hanging. So I ask the minister: What is the government going to do? What is their plan—their next move, their next strategy—for this tax? Is it still the government's intention to introduce a levy on 1 July? If the levy is not ready to be implemented on 1 July, how does the government intend to fill the $50 million black hole in the budget? If the biosecurity protection levy is up and running by 1 July, just three weeks away, have the government informed the industry, farmers and the 7,000 collection agents around Australia that they're ready to pay and collect?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, members in this place will be aware that, instead of taxing farmers to pay for the biosecurity risks of their foreign competitors, the coalition has been calling on the government to establish an importer container levy. This would apply a charge to cargo coming into the country. This would target those that create the risk. Given the failure of biosecurity, will the minister now consider this approach?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to again rise in this place and talk about what the Albanese Labor government is doing for our agriculture sector, delivering for the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors in the 2024-25 budget. The budget includes almost $800 million over the next eight years in new programs to support agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Measures in this budget build on the more than $3.1 billion—with a B—worth of new investments in agriculture. The Albanese Labor government is delivering for agriculture, fisheries and forestry in a way that the former government could only dream of and, to be quite frank, did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals sit here, carping from the sidelines about how they alone own this portfolio and only the National Party can understand agriculture. But it has taken a Labor government to deliver critical programs that the Nationals never could because they could not wrestle the purse strings from their coalition partner, who clearly had more control over the money than they ever did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences—known as ABARES—forecast the gross value of agricultural production will rise to $84 billion in 2024-25. Livestock production will increase with better seasonal conditions and a positive winter outlook will support crop production next year—and that is a good thing. This is due to the hard work of our farmers, fishers and foresters, the workers in this industry, and those who supply the supply chains, including those who work so hard in these sectors who are my own electorate of Paterson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last two years, the work that has been going on has been supported by government—a government that understands the importance of an industry that feeds us, clothes us and generates enormous wealth for our country. We do get farming. The Albanese Labor government has laid the groundwork to protect and grow this sector through record investments in priority areas like biosecurity, workforce, trade and adaption to climate change. It's delivering real results in partnership with industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has drawn a line under years of neglect, quite frankly, and stopgap bandaids, particularly in biosecurity, which is supposed to be a strong and fundamental net not only for our agriculture sector but also for our entire nation. However, the Nats were only able to pick up from the bottom of the cage what they could to bandaid together the net. The net was in tatters when they left government. It has taken the Labor Party to come to the fore and pick up that net, fix the net and make sure it is secure for all Australians. National Party ministers thought that good outcomes consisted of getting out the chequebook and having a grant here or there, rather than sustainably funding the one thing that farmers do depend on, and that is strong biosecurity. They were selling you a furphy, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our sustainable biosecurity funding model is more broadly based than ever before, maximising available funding for our critical biosecurity system. It took the Albanese Labor government to deliver this. The coalition 's legacy was a $100 million annual funding cut in biosecurity every single year. The coalition left biosecurity a budget of less than $500 million a year in 2025. In contrast, our government will invest $800 million in biosecurity in that same year, $300 million more than under the coalition. They are just the facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They say, 'Follow the money,' in all of these arguments. There's the cold hard fact of it. We're putting $300 million more into biosecurity than those who came before us did. They talk to us about biosecurity all the time, saying: 'No, we were doing it. It's all fine.' It wasn't fine. You don't need to be an agriculturalist to understand we need to keep Australians safe from things like lumpy skin disease and foot-and-mouth disease. It's not only for the ag sector; it's for us all. This government is delivering not only for agriculture but for all Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  This is a good opportunity to highlight the utter betrayal by the Labor government in introducing the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024. This bill represents complete and absolute treachery by Labor towards Western Australian farmers and regional communities within my electorate of Durack and within the electorate of O'Connor. I acknowledge my friend and colleague, Rick Wilson, the member for O'Connor, who is sitting here with me in the Chamber. The consequences of this legislation are not merely political. They are deeply personal and devastating to the livelihoods of hardworking Australians who rely upon this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday, the member for O'Connor and I had the privilege of attending the Keep the Sheep rally in Perth's CBD. This rally was attended by thousands of Western Australian farmers, industry representatives and supporters from all walks of life. The outpouring of support was truly overwhelming, with over 1,300 vehicles converging on Perth to stand united against this destructive bill. Large trucks adorned with signs reading 'Keep the sheep' and 'Stand with our farmers' were a real testament to the solidarity and resolve of our regional communities and our thousands of city supporters. The rally was respectful and dignified, just like the character of the people that it represented. Unlike the behaviour and attitude of some opposite, who have pandered to the whims of inner-city voters, our movement stands for real Australia—the Australia that understands the value of hard work and community and understands that agriculture is the backbone of our nation. I encourage those who are listening to sign the 'Keep the sheep' petition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. This is not just a political battle; it is a battle for people's lives and livelihoods. But don't take my word for it. I received this email last night from Wesley and Louise Hagboom from Dowerin:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Minister</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We write to you as a husband and wife farming team in Dowerin, parents of 3 children and local volunteers/committee members of various clubs and organisations in our local area. Our family have farmed cereal crops and sheep on this land for 4 generations. Our split enterprise of livestock and cropping is a vital element to the viability of our business allowing us to successfully mitigate seasonal and financial variations over many years. We also run a small sheep contracting business … which assists bringing an extra off farm income into the business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We rely heavily on the live export of sheep by sea, it is a significant income stream for our business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The removal of this industry would devastate families and communities like ours, forcing us to seriously consider removing sheep from our enterprise altogether. We will not be alone in this way of thinking, fellow farmers like us will also find the farming of sheep in WA unviable therefore our small sheep contracting business will not survive which will impact on our viability living in this rural area altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, the effect this decision will have on our small community is concerning. We contribute countless hours in volunteerism throughout various aspects of our local community and the flow on effect that this decision will have will decimate regional communities—less people in our already struggling towns means less children in our schools, less people supporting local businesses, less volunteers to run local sporting groups and organisations. The wider impact is huge. It will lead to many people abandoning country living altogether.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We strongly believe that we are giving our small family the best possible childhood raising them in the Wheatbelt area of WA. They are growing into three kind, empathetic and community minded individuals who hold strong values in family, community and respecting the land that surrounds them. It is our belief that the phase out of live export will have significant detrimental effects on our family and our children's future on the land will be in doubt. It is devastating to think that they will not be able to give their own children the same country upbringing that they had, due to a political decision by our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I implore you to use your voice and influence on this matter, please work with us—listen to us and our industry stakeholders to ensure that the live sheep trade by sea continues. This will protect the livelihoods of many West Australians. Our voices and our livelihoods matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks very much to Wes and Lou. What a fabulous contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This campaign is bigger than politics. It is about the survival of our communities, our heritage and our way of life. The government must listen to the Western Australians and recognise the catastrophic effect this bill will have. We stand united, from the city to the regions, in defence of our farmers and of our future. I'm so proud of our WA farmers and pastoralists—for feeding us, for looking after our land, for providing employment, for looking after our community. So, the question is, what's next? It's sheep now, so ask yourself. Minister, advise us of whether the Albanese government's plan is to also ban the live export of cattle.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Primary production in agriculture and fisheries has always been at the bedrock of Australian cultural and economic life, and that continues to be the case today. It's certainly been the case in my electorate of Fremantle, especially in terms of fisheries but also in the form of small-scale fruit and vegetable production, which in some ways is a legacy of the time when market gardens were a distinctive feature of life in Freo and Cockburn. And while Fremantle has for a long time been home to a range of high-quality fishing operations, including Australia's first MSC certified octopus fishery, it's now looking at new kinds of production in the form of activities like seaweed aquaculture. So I'm certainly interested in hearing from the minister about how we're helping this kind of innovation through the $8 million of funding in the Australian seaweed program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last week I had the privilege of going out with Fremantle Seaweed to harvest some <span style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Asparagopsis</span> for transplanting to their 32-hectare aquaculture set-up off C.Y. O'Connor Beach. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Caulerpa</span> is also known as sea grapes. I thought it was pretty good. And, of course, the <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">sparagopsis</span> is significant because of its enormous potential as a feed supplement for livestock, with the CSIRO reporting that <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">spa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ragopsis</span> can reduce methane emissions in ruminant livestock by more than 90 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is absolutely backing in this kind of forward-looking innovation in agriculture and aquaculture because that's the nature of primary production: it's always looking to how things can be done better, more efficiently and more sustainably, with higher yields and less environmental impact or even with environmental benefits. Indeed, that concept is what drives the nature repair market, a reform that started with the National Party in the previous government. It allows those who want to invest in environmental repair to be matched with suitable projects, almost always involving farmers and/or First Nations Australians, in order to deliver meaningful and measurable restoration and biodiversity improvements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is and always has been a trading nation, and I'd ask the minister to provide some information about how agricultural exports are growing under the Albanese government. We know Australian agriculture is the basis of the delicious and healthy produce we all enjoy. But it's also about delivering for an export market, and that's definitely the case with WA's remarkable wheat belt, which has achieved record crops in recent years, the vast majority of which is for export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to achieve the potential of Australia's primary production, we have to look to create new and larger markets overseas. And I can say, as the chair of the Treaties Committee, that I've been fortunate, as has my colleague the member for Spence, to be part of that process. The new government has delivered trade and investment agreements with both the UK and India. As I understand it, that's already seen impressive new market access for Australian farmers and producers. In fact, in the first 12 months since the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement entered into force, agricultural exports were up by 60 per cent, the big winners being salmon, almonds, beans and avocados. I'm particularly glad to note, as we implement our commitment to sensibly manage the final part of a decades-old transition out of the irremediably harmful live sheep export trade, that processed lamb exports to India increased by 160 per cent last year, while processed lamb and mutton exports to the UK were up by 17 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively, in 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The task of protecting Australia's biosecurity is vital to keep our world-leading produce free from pests and diseases that are rife elsewhere so as to maintain bountiful production, keep animals free from harm, protect the broader community from the risk of zoonotic disease and hold up our reputation across the board in terms of the health and sustainability of Australian food and fibre. The biosecurity challenge has particular meaning in Western Australia, as I know my colleagues will understand, which in some ways, as COVID-19 showed, is an island within an island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, the Albanese government has been prepared to take new measures to protect Australian biosecurity and put it on a more sustainable footing. For the first time in our history, we've got a sustainable biosecurity funding model, with a record $1 billion investment. In addition to that record funding, the new model means more transparency for farmers and importers, giving them more of a say on biosecurity priorities. In the most recent budget, we allocated $16.9 million to ensure the biosecurity integrity of Australia's border remains contemporary and adaptable, and that includes specialist technology and equipment, and detector dogs at Western Sydney's new airport to keep Australia free from exotic pests and diseases. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm keen to hear from the minister in all of these areas—supporting innovation, improving biosecurity, responding to environmental and climate risks and expanding export market opportunities. I don't think there's any question that the Albanese government, through the excellent work of Minister Watt, is working hand in hand with Australian primary producers to build a stronger and more sustainable future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  It's ironic, as I rise to speak on this consideration in detail, that the only significant new money in the agriculture budget this year is the $107 million that's been allocated to shut down an agricultural industry. Sadly, for the people of O'Connor and the people of Durack—and into the electorate of Forrest—that is specifically targeted at your farm businesses and your livelihoods. It's not just restricted to those regional electorates in Western Australia. There are, of course, many people who work in the supply chain and in the feedlots on the periphery of Perth, and there are also the agribusinesses that support that trade. So it's a very sad day and a very sad budget for the agriculture sector across Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister, when she delivered her second reading speech introducing the bill to shut down live sheep exports, said that the legislation would 'better align Australian export law with community expectations'. The minister cited a petition that was signed by 43,758 people last year as proof. Now, that's a lot of people, I know—and I'm not sure whether it was the RSPCA or Animals Australia who ran that petition—but seven days ago, a week ago, a group called Keep the Sheep stood up a website and set up a petition, and, as I was waiting while the wonderful member for Durack was speaking, I checked the number, and it had clicked over to 43,894 people. They have said they oppose the government's move to shut down the live sheep export trade. That's in just seven days. I might also add that on the same page there is a donation button, and the good people of Western Australia have donated $268,000 towards a campaign against this legislation. That's been growing very rapidly. I've been keeping an eye on that. There are a lot of people who are dipping into their pocket and contributing money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to that, last Friday 1,700 vehicles registered for the convoy that the member for Durack mentioned—3,000 farmers. I was there, as the member for Durack was. I spoke to people in the morning at the top of Bedfordale Hill at a quarter past seven. Some people had been up at three or four in the morning to get there in time. One particular farmer said, 'I feel uplifted, because this is the first time, after years of being kicked and denigrated by the government and the animal activists, that we're actually fighting back.' That was a significant moment in this campaign, and I can tell you that the farmers of Western Australia are absolutely up and about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $107 million that we're discussing here is supposedly a support package, so my question to the minister is: who's this going to assist—I've had a briefing from the department, and they were a little bit vague—and how is it going to be delivered? One would assume that the Western Australian department of agriculture would have a role in delivering this assistance, but on 16 May, just after the minister made his announcement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">South Western Times</span>, the WA agriculture minister, Jackie Jarvis, stood up in state parliament and revealed that she had sent a blistering letter to Minister Watt, highlighting the ongoing drought in WA and the state's efforts to support farmers. She said, 'I believe your announcement has added to the negative sentiment of the WA sheep industry at the worst possible time.' This is the Western Australian minister for agriculture. But, importantly, in relation to the $107 million package, she went on to say, 'Given your decision and subsequent package is not in the interest of WA, it is difficult to see how we can work collaboratively.' That is a state Labor agriculture minister referring to the $107 million package that was announced in this budget. So I'm not sure how the minister's going to deliver this assistance, given that the minister has made it very clear that her department will find it very difficult to work collaboratively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in my last few seconds, I note that in the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> on Sunday the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said of the live export industry, 'I don't think they've done enough to meet community standards.' The reason that that sends shivers of fear down the spines of Western Australian farmers is that the live export industry's animal welfare outcomes are better than those on farm, so the Western Australian farming community are thinking, 'They're coming after our farms next.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  In considering the proposed expenditure of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio, I do so through a myriad of perspectives. I start off by viewing agriculture in the way I first knew: as a kid growing up on a farm in Mildura. This lived experience has put me in good stead to now sit on the House Standing Committee on Agriculture. A report tabled late last year, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian food story: feeding the nation and beyond</span>, involved travelling across the country to see innovative ways Australians in agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture adapt to harsh conditions and come out on top. The basis of the report and its findings are extremely germane to our government's holistic policy to augment this industry while safeguarding it from risks in the short, medium and long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Spence, where farming occupations account for around two per cent of all jobs and which is home to the Northern Adelaide Plains Food Cluster, I see firsthand the importance of agriculture. This region produces around 200,000 tonnes of produce each year, with a farmgate value of roughly $300 million. Our agriculture industry is crucial not just to Spence but across the nation. The sector provides the food we eat and contributes to food security, economic growth, international trade, and direct and indirect employment. A strong agricultural industry means a stronger and more prosperous Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has acted to provide necessary tools for growth by removing trade barriers and improving access to global markets. In the three years leading up to 2019-20, Australia exported around 72 per cent of its total value of agricultural, fisheries and forestry production. Since coming into office, we have reduced trade impediments imposed by China from $20 billion to less than $1 billion, benefiting key agricultural and forestry exports like bottled wine, barley, red meat, timber logs, and oat and hay. In 2023, China returned as our most valuable destination for agricultural, fisheries and forestry products, worth $17 billion. Our efforts to build stronger ties with India, negotiate a free trade agreement with the UAE and support regional trade cooperation are opening new doors for Australian agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indo-Pacific and South-East Asian regions are critical markets for Australian agriculture. In 2022, our agriculture and food exports to South-East Asia were valued at $17.5 billion. Key commodities such as wheat, cotton and beef are vital to these markets. Our wheat exports to Indonesia alone were valued at $2.4 billion, while cotton exports to Vietnam reached $1.97 billion. Over the past decade, wheat exports to South-East Asia have increased by 215 per cent and cotton exports have surged to 524 per cent. Our strategic engagement aims to enhance these trade relationships further. Australia's agriculture and food trade with South-East Asia is diverse. Wheat is used for bakery items, pasta, noodles and animal feed, while cotton supports the textile industry. Australian beef and dairy products are essential for the retail and hospitality sectors in these regions. Our government supports for new market access, such as access for Hass avocados to Thailand and India, is crucial for expanding these relationships. Agriculture as a sector in 2022-23 contributed 13.6 per cent of Australia's goods and services exports, was valued at $94.3 billion and employed 257,000 people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to recognise, mitigate and innovate in response to climate change is not controversial but a reality. The damage from inaction can be measured in billions of dollars in losses to our economy and tens of thousands of jobs lost. The House Standing Committee on Agriculture's inquiry on food security, with submissions from the National Farmers Federation, highlighted the current impacts and costs of climate change to the sector and the need for adaptive actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring food security is a cornerstone of our national policy, guaranteeing all Australians have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. The Albanese Labor government understands the interconnectedness of food security and national security and the need to plan ahead to build the resilience and sustainability of our food supply chains. Australia's farming communities are on the frontline of climate change, facing frequent and severe droughts. The Albanese government is committed to helping these communities, through the Future Drought Fund. We're investing $561.3 million towards supporting farmers and regional communities in managing drought and climate risks. This includes $235 million for local community partnerships, $137.4 million for informed decision-making and $120.3 million for innovative solutions to build long-term resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons, I believe the proposed expenditure for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Portfolio should be adopted.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  You know you're getting old when you hark back to the good old days, but I was just talking to the member for Gippsland and we recall that, back in the good old days—that's code for 'when the coalition was in government'—ministers came into this consideration-in-detail process and actually answered questions. It wasn't just an opportunity for a set piece by a backbencher or, indeed, for an assistant minister to get up and spruik for five minutes about how good their party was and how bad the other side was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this process here, with agriculture, I don't see the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—that would be the member for Ballarat—in the chamber. I appreciate that the member for Eden-Monaro, the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories is here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This consideration-in-detail process used to be a time when a backbencher would get up and ask a question, in all sincerity, and the minister would then respond, or, if the minister didn't respond there and then, they would take it on notice and respond in writing. But this is just an echo chamber. It is, as the Australian public sometimes argues, just a waste of time. And it's such a shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Labor members who are delivering these set pieces, there is a formula. The questions are: 'Have you ever visited a farm? Have you eaten food from a farm? Is a merino a sheep or a cow?' If they can answer those questions correctly, they get to come in here and deliver a piece from the Labor dirt unit on how good they are and how bad we are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is such a shame, because this could be such a good process. I remember, as Deputy Prime Minister, I used to come in and actually answer questions in this process, or, if I didn't have the time to answer them in the five minutes allotted, I'd take them on notice and I'd respond to the member who'd asked the question. But now, all too often, we've got ministers who just aren't answering the questions and just aren't using this process. It is consideration in detail. I can see you're rolling your eyes, Member for Eden-Monaro, but it's true. You probably weren't here during those times when we did actually answer questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I will ask a question, Minister, and I hope you might take it to whoever is representing agriculture in this parliament. Last time I looked it was Senator Murray Watt, but there were some rumours earlier in the week that he might be going to take a different portfolio. Will the agriculture minister work with the environment minister to listen to the river communities which will be so adversely affected by water buybacks? I ask that in the context of the budget papers and of having just heard from the member for O'Connor saying that there's no new money in agriculture, except for $107 million to shut down the Western Australian live sheep trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But my question is around water buybacks. In the budget papers, it is listed as 'NFP'. I'm assuming that is 'not for publication'. It could be anything, but I'm assuming it's 'not for publication': the amount of money that Labor will spend on buying productive water out of the Murray-Darling Basin to send down to the mouth of the Murray. That's not to grow food, not to grow fibre and not to help those river communities and local economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what happens when you buy productive water out of those productive areas is that the farmer gets his or her money; the market is distorted, because the Commonwealth has come with a very big chequebook; the farmer goes off to the Gold Coast; but the little local cafe or the hairdresser or the garage or, indeed, the school loses customers and clients, or, in the case of the school, children. And then what happens is that the state government looks at that and says, 'Well, that school is not entitled to however-many full-time equivalents, so we'll cut teacher numbers; we'll cut the administration numbers,' and the school suffers; the river-community town or city suffers. And they are suffering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The media release from the shadow minister for water, Senator Perin Davey, who does understand agriculture, who does understand farming and who certainly understands river communities, talks about the unknown figures, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know there is only around $1 billion remaining in the Water for the Environment Special Account—funds set aside to deliver 450 GL over and above the Basin Plan targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We also know that based on the most recent Government tender the Government paid over $7,600 per megalitre. So simple maths tells us it will cost at least $3.42 billion to recover that volume. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we don't know is if the Government has anywhere near that much money set aside. All we see from the Government is secrecy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I am delighted to speak on this budget, which is a budget for every Australian. It includes tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. Eighty-four per cent of taxpayers will be better off under the reformed tax arrangements that are being legislated by this government compared to those that were being proposed by the other government. I see the member for Reid in the chamber. I know that she is very focused on the position of women taxpayers and women workers in her electorate and right across the economy. I know she is very keen to ensure that women get a good deal. Ninety per cent of women will be better off under this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we've heard a lot from the other side about energy and cost-of-living issues. The entry price to a discussion around cost-of-living issues and concern about energy issues is not what you say but what you do. Last year, those opposite had the opportunity to vote for a proposition to put a cap on the price of coal and gas and provide energy bill relief for every Australian; they voted against it. While expressing concern, they voted against relief. They will have another opportunity with the $300 for every household energy bill relief. The question for the other side is whether they will repeat their performance of last year and vote against cheaper power bills for Australians, or will they back this budget plan to reduce bills by $300?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we want stronger Medicare in every community. When we came to government, Medicare was on life support, throttled to within an inch of its life by the now Leader of the Opposition, who was voted the worst health care minister in our nation's history. We are now resuscitating Medicare and breathing life back into this system. Bulk-billing rates are on the rise again. We're also trying to take the pressure off public hospitals, so our budget initiative to increase the number of urgent care clinics around the country will ensure that we have a stronger Medicare system in every community—absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE, yes, it's important that we address the skill shortage in this country by inviting skilled people from other parts around the world, but we want to see Australians get the first crack at those jobs. I know this is an issue you are very interested in and very concerned about given your background, Deputy Speaker Claydon. This budget is about ensuring that we are investing in skills, and fee-free TAFE is a key part of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more homes in every part of the country. We need to ensure that every Australian, whether they are renting, purchasing or seeking to purchase a home, has a roof over their head. The excellent work by the housing minister is another instalment of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiscal responsibility has been the talisman of this government. We have been able to improve the budget bottom line by over $215 billion in two years through the three budgets that we have been able to deliver. We've been able to turn nine Liberal Party deficits into two Labor government surpluses because of the fiscal discipline that we've put into place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of the great but untold stories of our economic management has been the employment story. There are more Australians in work, more jobs being created and one of the lowest persistent unemployment levels on record. We are going to maintain that momentum. There have been over 870,000 additional Australians in jobs over the last two years. It changes their lives, and it means they have the dignity of work and the prosperity that high-paying decent jobs brings to them. But it also means that there are more taxpayers, and one of the benefits of having more Australians in work is that it ensures we have got more revenue coming in, which is helping us pay down the debt that we inherited from the other side. So these are the hallmarks of budget management on our watch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do regret to inform the chamber that there is no allocation in this budget for coffee mugs or for slogans printed on them that say 'Back in Black', but I can affirm to the chamber that, in the absence of coffee mugs, we have been able to deliver a surplus. Of course, we're keen on ensuring that Australia continues to be a country that makes stuff, and, if you want to be a clever country, you've got to be a country that makes stuff, which is what our Future Made in Australia plan is all about. We back a future made in Australia. They oppose it, which begs the question: which country will Australia's future be made in if it's not here in Australia? I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I note that the Treasurer is not here. I also note that the minister for industry has not been here this week. It seems that it wasn't just last night that we saw the New South Welshman take out the Queenslander with a high shot. We saw that earlier this week when the industry minister took out the Treasurer with a high shot. He has disappeared—explaining to the Treasurer that he got his budget wrong. It's true that the minister for industry is the Joseph Suaalii of the parliament and the Treasurer seems to be the Reece Walsh.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact of the matter is that this Treasurer had an opportunity to hand down a budget just a couple of weeks ago that was going to set Australia back on track, get back to basics and get things right, but what we saw was a budget that was the third flop from this Treasurer. It was his third budget, his third failure, his third flop, as he handed down a budget which was absolutely the wrong budget for the times. It was panned by economists across the board. As a result, it sank without a trace within about 36 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By the weekend, no-one was talking about the Treasurer's budget because it was meaningless and it wasn't actually dealing with the issues. They were talking about the budget-in-reply speech, because it actually dealt with the issues that Australians are facing: re-establishing the dream of homeownership, making sure that we're putting downward pressure on inflation and setting us up for prosperity over the longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were three tests for this budget. The first was about restoring our standard of living back to where it was before Labor came to power. The truth is that Australians are poorer under Labor—two years of Labor and they're poorer. That is an undeniable fact. Indeed, we saw it in the national accounts just yesterday, where Australians' real disposable income per person—that's their standard of living—which was translated into the common-sense numbers that we saw yesterday, has collapsed by eight per cent under Labor. That means they're eight per cent poorer. That's what happens with a Labor government. The numbers yesterday were stunning, but they only told us what we know and what we see every single day when we're out and about in our electorates all around Australia. We see the pain that Australians are feeling, at the food banks and in the mortgage belt areas. When we go to sporting matches, we see and talk to Australians who are suffering under a Labor government that doesn't understand basic economics. The second test was to set us up for prosperity over the longer term, to restore not just our standard of living but our way of life. That includes the dream of homeownership, which for so many young Australians is becoming out of reach under this government. The third thing that they needed to do was restore the fiscal disciplines that had been in place since the 1990s, but this Treasurer knows better! He's remaking capitalism. I don't think Australians think he's remaking it very well, but he's certainly remaking capitalism as he brings down a budget with billions of dollars of corporate welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Billions for billionaires is what we see in this budget. The Treasurer is fond of saying—he's now admitting—that there's $315 billion of extra spending in this budget. Some of it we support, but there's much of it we don't. We've opposed $45 billion through the parliament. The corporate welfare that he is handing out to his mates is not something we can possibly support. There are many measures, like $600,000 for a speechwriter for the Minister for the NDIS. I tell you what—I'm not sure you're getting value for money with that, given the speeches we've heard from the Minister for the NDIS over the last little while. The truth is that that is how they're spending taxpayers' hard-earned money. Taxpayers are suffering under this government like they haven't in the lifetime of anyone who is in Australia today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question for the minister, who is a no-show, and the assistant minister, who's on his way out as well, is: why are Australians paying the price for this government's complete economic incompetence?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, Assistant Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  When Labor came to office, Australia's economy was insufficiently competitive. We had seen one of the lousiest decades of productivity growth in the postwar era. Australia's household living standards had suffered, and real wages had flatlined as a result of what they described as a 'deliberate design feature' of their economic architecture. And so Labor, since taking office, has set about injecting a little bit more dynamism, a little bit more competition, into the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Australian economy under the former government had some serious competition problems. We know that over that period we saw an increase in market concentration in many industry sectors. Work by the OECD's Dan Andrews and Macquarie University's Elise Dwyer has shown that, if you compare Australia and the United States across 17 industries, the Australian economy is more concentrated than the US economy in 16 out of those 17 industries. This isn't just a matter of Australia being a medium-sized economy. If you look over the period from 2006 to 2020, Dan Andrews and Elise Dwyer find that the Australian economy became more concentrated, not less. Our size grew, but the market concentration problem got worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former government, we saw mark-ups increasing. We saw the rate of business startups—that is, business startups that employ workers—declining over this period. We also saw a decline in job mobility, another key indicator of a dynamic economy. I want to pay tribute to the member for Fraser, Daniel Mulino, an extraordinary economist who has led a critical inquiry by the House of Representatives Economics Committee, which has looked at the issue of market dynamism and made a series of recommendations right across the board about how Australia's economy can be made more dynamic and more competitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to a couple of particular reforms that the government is making. One of those is in the area of supermarkets. We've referred supermarket competition to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We have asked Craig Emerson, the former competition minister, to review the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. Dr Emerson's interim report made clear that in his view the code, which was set up under the Liberal and National parties as a voluntary code, should be made a mandatory code. The government is giving serious consideration to this recommendation. Later this month, CHOICE will be bringing down the first of its quarterly price monitoring reports, giving Australian shoppers guidance as to where they can get the cheapest basket of groceries. This is the sort of straightforward practical advice that turbocharges supermarket competition and ensures that shoppers and farmers can get a better deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also looking seriously at the issue of noncompete clauses. Across the Australian economy we now know that one in five workers have a clause in their employment contract that hampers them from moving to a better-paying job. That dampens wages and business startups. If you want to start a new firm in a full-employment economy you need to hire workers from other firms. But if all the talent is locked up by noncompete clauses, you may not be able to get your business off the ground. In recommending a full ban on non-competes across the US economy, the US federal Trade Commission has suggested that such a ban would lead to a US$524 annual increase in wages for the typical American worker and would create 8,500 new American businesses. We're giving serious consideration to those issues here, and we have just closed an issues paper at the end of May.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as on the sporting field, competition in the economy is a good thing. The member for Gippsland and I have a healthy competition on the running front, and both of us benefit from thinking about the gains from competition that can be made when we're out there racing and training. The Australian economy, too, needs a bit more competition, a bit more economic dynamism, in order to raise the living standards of all Australians.</span>

                    </a>  It would be nice if he were here. I notice the Assistant Treasurer has also left the building. Worse off under every measure are the Australian people after two years of this government, and this budget does nothing to assist them. We've seen real disposable income reduced by nearly eight per cent over the past two years. Families are dipping into their savings to cover costs, with the household savings ratio dipping 9.9 per cent over the last two years. The reasons for this are that mortgage payments have almost tripled. There are all-time rental prices highs and record low supply, and there's been a 20 per cent rise in the collection of personal income taxes through bracket creep. I know those opposite are attempting to sell the notion that they're giving a little bit of that back, but I can say that the people I've spoken to don't know about it, and they won't see it. They just see their costs continuing to go up. There are continuing energy price hikes, prices on goods have increased by nearly 10 per cent and we continue to see productivity fall. It's fallen by some 5.2 per cent under this government. We all know in this place that productivity is a key factor in economic growth and long-term prosperity is impossible without it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I look at some of the other measures, there is one measure that is not talked about very often. Those opposite love to talk about wage price increases through the wage price index, but what they forget to talk about is the living costs index for employee households. The wage price index is running at some 4.1 per cent, but the living costs index for employee households is running at some 6.5 per cent. So, whilst wages might be rising, the truth is that employees are roughly 2½ per cent worse off despite those wage increases. As I've said, that has come about through higher mortgage costs and higher costs of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing at the end of the day is an anaemic economy that only grew by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter. I talk to businesses out there. Their confidence is rapidly declining as they see their input costs growing and continuing supply chain constraints. Their rent has gone through the roof, and they have no confidence, or very little confidence, in the future direction of this country under this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before us in the House at the moment is a bill that is going to further increase red tape and regulation. If we want to achieve productivity in this country, one of the things we've got to do is get rid of red tape and regulation. Yet what we are seeing the government doing at this very moment with a bill before the House is introducing scope 3 emissions accounting. For larger businesses, it means they will have to account for the emissions of all of their suppliers through their entire supply chain, from the smallest business in Australia that supplies a business that is covered by that regulation. Now, many small businesses do not have the time or the capability to do that properly, so they'll have to get outside consultants in, which will be another cost to business. I believe the estimated regulatory impact cost of that measures is some $2.3 billion to the economy, which will be borne by small and medium-sized businesses. This government has done nothing to support business, so I ask the question: when is the government going to stand up for Australians and do something for them? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  A few sporting analogies have been bandied about during this session, so I'm going to add one of my own here. It's probably not one that the Prime Minister would like, but on the point of housing affordability I am going to say that the coalition are the Rabbitohs when it comes to housing policy, because they are dead last; they are the wooden spoons. If we look at what is happening on housing, they vacated the field entirely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing affordability is a concern for families right across my electorate. There is a higher proportion of renters and mortgage holders in the electorate of Reid than in any other part of the country, so any increases in rent or interest rates have a disproportionate impact on my community. Sydney has been ranked as the world's second-least affordable market after Hong Kong, with an average home costing more than 13 times the median salary. But it hasn't always been this way. When my parents came to this country more than four decades ago, they worked hard and were able to buy a home within five years of arriving in this country. Our family's success was possible because of the stability given to them by affordable housing. That stability is now out of reach for many families in Sydney. So how did we get here? A problem as big as this did not happen overnight. It has been brewing for years and years and years. We are here because of a decade of complete and utter failure by the Rabbitohs of housing policy—the former coalition government at federal and state levels. Under their watch there was no investment in housing and no policies to increase housing supply, so we are now left with a critical housing shortage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a responsibility to do what we can to build more homes. That is exactly what our focus has been for the last three budgets. We are laser focused on increasing housing supply. In our first budget, the Treasurer announced an ambitious goal of building more than a million homes, including $350 million for the federal government and for the states and territories to build 10,000 new homes each year. In our second budget, we made changes to encourage more investment in build-to-rent developments, boosted homelessness funding and made it easier to buy a home, by expanding the eligibility of the Home Guarantee Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this recent budget, we announced $6.2 billion in new investment to build more homes and support Australians. In this budget alone there has been more investment in housing than in all nine of the coalition budgets combined. Over the three Albanese Labor government budgets, we have invested a total of $32 billion in new housing initiatives. That is a record investment. This is what a government does when it wants to tackle housing affordability head on. When it comes to housing, the contrast between this side of the House and those opposite could not be more stark. We have ambitious plans, record investment and big targets to build more homes, whereas those on the opposite side have a lightweight policy that involves getting young people to raid their superannuation. It's a policy that has been collectively panned by housing experts and economists alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting on with the job of bringing homeownership back into reach for millions of Australians. We've helped more than 110,000 Australians into homeownership through the Home Guarantee Scheme, and through the Housing Australia Future Fund we are making the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. We are working with state governments and committing $1 billion in this budget to get the necessary infrastructure to make communities work—roads, parks and community facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we love big infrastructure projects: the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the opera house and the Snowy Hydro scheme. We are obsessed with major infrastructure projects. I think that housing is the next major infrastructure project that we as a government are going to build in this country. That is something that we can be proud of, because we are unashamedly ambitious with our housing policy, unlike those opposite.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  The national accounts figures for the March quarter, released yesterday, show GDP lifted by only 0.1 per cent across the first three months of the year. This is the slowest rate of growth in 30-odd years, outside the COVID era. On a per capita basis, growth fell by 0.4 per cent. We are in a per capita recession, and this was the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. What that means for the average Australian is that things are getting worse and they're going backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing keeping that growth figure in the positive—only just—is the unprecedented level of immigration that this government is bringing to the country. To be very clear, this government is using immigration to stave off a recession. The problem is that the explosion in immigration numbers does not come without a further cost. Whilst immigration keeps this government out of recession, it's keeping existing Australians out of the housing market. Our housing crisis is being made worse day by day as this government's high-immigration strategy plays out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this situation isn't hurting all Australians equally. We are all hurting, but there are key demographics bearing an unfair share of the weight. There are two, in particular, that we often talk about. The first is 21- to 29-year-olds, who are the only demographic to have seen both their discretionary and their non-discretionary spending go backwards. These are Australians who are in the early stages of their careers, on lower wages, and who are probably experiencing the upward pressure on rental costs and definitely experiencing inflationary pressures on almost everything else. They have little capacity to save a deposit for a house. Even if they are lent that money from the bank of mum and dad, there is very little capacity to service a loan. With inflation staying higher for longer because of Labor's high spending and house prices continuing to shoot up because of Labor's immigration policies, their hopes of homeownership are floating away. To rub salt into their wounds, Labor's housing policy is yet to build a single house, and, as was extensively covered in yesterday's media, Labor is unlikely to build one before the end of this term of government. As the Treasurer acknowledged, his policies have failed young Australians. The second group are renting pensioners. With fixed incomes and the price of everything going up and up, their quality of life in what should be their golden years is going backwards. Does the Treasurer acknowledge, too, that his policies have failed older Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Labor's third budget was a typical high-taxing, high-spending Labor budget, the solution to this government's problems can actually be found in the Labor playbook, because the last government to reduce spending as a percentage of GDP for three consecutive years was the Hawke and Keating government in the late 1980s. If this government had the courage to embark on an exercise in spending reduction, as its forebears did, I believe it would receive not only bipartisan support but also the support of the Australian people. Australians can see that Labor's policies are disproportionately hurting vulnerable people; Australians can see that Labor's policies are working against the RBA and causing inflation to stay higher for longer; and Australians can see that Labor's policies are driving up demand in the housing market, squeezing young homebuyers out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, Labor has increased spending by $315 billion. That equates to roughly $30,000 per Australian household, yet the typical family with a mortgage is now more than $35,000 worse off since Labor took office. There can be no claim that Labor's spending is making things better. The RBA governor confirmed yesterday that the narrow path Australia must walk to get inflation back within that target band of two to three per cent is now stretched out even longer. Our hopes of an interest rate cut in the next 12 months have all but disappeared, as the 52-week bond market is now clearly pricing in no reduction in interest rates during that period. The governor herself still holds out the possibility of a rate rise in that period. Australia's future is gloomier because of Labor's policies. In just the past year, domestic inflation has been five per cent, while imported inflation has been one per cent. Our inflation problem is now homegrown. It is not being driven by foreign wars or foreign politics. Our inflation is being driven by the government's policies. Put simply: Labor has the wrong priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the Treasurer explain how spending $620,000 on a speechwriter makes life better for a pensioner struggling to pay their rent? Can the Treasurer explain how spending $1 billion for a foreign company to deliver a quantum computer will help Australians through this cost-of-living crisis? Can the Treasurer explain how increasing public servant numbers by 10 per cent in just one year aligns in any way with his repeated claims of spending restraint? As covered by Phil Coorey in the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span>, Labor's third budget banks in a decade of deficits. How can the Treasurer possibly celebrate a surplus that comes at the cost of 10 years of deficit? We often look at the Costello years, with 10 years of surpluses in a row. We have the opposite laid out in front of us because of this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation hurts all of us, but it spreads its pain unfairly across our community. What I'm laying out is the moral case for reducing spending. If we continue to drive inflation, vulnerable demographics in our community will bear an unfair amount of the load that inflation's putting on all of us. Responsible, sensible reduction in spending can alleviate that problem and make for a better Australia.</span>

It is a budget that continues to put downward pressure on inflation but does so in a responsible way which provides much-needed assistance, in a well calibrated way, to those who need it most. Those opposite speak of an alternative approach, an approach built around austerity. They keep speaking about a budget with hundreds of billions of dollars of too much spending when the vast majority of the dollars that they speak of is for indexation of core services like the age pension or core public services. It really is incumbent on those opposite to clarify which core services they will cut and which benefits they won't see increased if they're going to continue on this line of austerity. The continued calls for austerity when people are doing it tough make me think that the opposition are like the 1990s IMF but without any economics PhDs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inflation that Australia has experienced over recent years is a global phenomenon. It came from global supply chains seizing up after COVID and from the war in Ukraine pushing up energy prices. In Australia, after that global inflation hit our shores, we have seen a significant reduction in inflation over the last two years through a combination of monetary and fiscal policy working together and well calibrated and well targeted cost-of-living supports. We've seen two surpluses delivered successively in that time, we've seen a $200 billion turnaround in the government's fiscal position relative to what we inherited, and we've seen significant savings identified in successive budgets—three budgets in a row—versus zero dollars in savings identified by those opposite.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation remains above the band of two to three per cent, but it needs to be acknowledged that it has come down significantly. In annual terms, it has come down from 7.8 per cent at its peak to 3.6 per cent in the last quarterly reading. In monthly terms, it has come down significantly, from a peak of just over eight per cent in late 2022 to under four per cent now. This significant decrease in inflation has been driven by a reduction in goods inflation, and we are now also seeing a reduction in services inflation, which peaked at a later time but is now also easing. The government's strategy is working. Based on Treasury modelling, inflation could return to the target band by the end of 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have more work to do. We know people are still doing it tough. We know inflation is still higher than it should be. But this budget is aimed, firstly, at putting further downward pressure on inflation through responsible fiscal settings that see us, as I mentioned, having another surplus. But this budget also responds to the fact that people are doing it tough by providing those who need it most with assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most critical measure that provides people with that assistance is the amendments to the stage 3 tax cuts, which provide millions of people with bigger tax cuts than they would have otherwise had. The starkest comparison is for those on incomes of $18,000 to $45,000, who will receive more than $800 a year in tax cuts under us, versus absolutely nothing under the tax cuts proposed by the opposition. This is a huge difference. In my own electorate, where people are doing it tough and talk to me about it constantly, 87 per cent of taxpayers will do materially better under our tax cuts compared with those the opposition put forward. The opposition complained about our tax cuts in parliament and reluctantly voted for them. What is it that they actually put forward as their plan?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, there's $7.8 billion in cost-of-living relief, including a $300 energy bill rebate for households and a $325 rebate for small businesses. We're increasing maximum rates of Commonwealth rent assistance, making this the first time in a long time that there's been a second successive increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. Then there's the raft of measures that provide for cheaper medicines, something that is making a huge difference for people in my electorate, where there has already been well over $1 million in savings from cheaper medicines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this is the budget for the times. It is a budget that continues to put downward pressure on inflation. This is a budget that will see us move closer towards the band we need to be in. But while we're on that journey the budget will provide those in the community who are the most vulnerable with the assistance they need.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  My questions to the government relating to the budget are focused around building houses for Australians and the long-term infrastructure commitments that compete against our sector's ability to build more homes. Housing is the biggest short-term and long-term cost-of-living issue in this country. It is tragic that in our country people on moderate incomes who are doing important jobs cannot be certain that they will actually be able to build a future and build a family with secure housing. We need to fix this. It's an issue that everyone cares about—young people in my electorate, such as my Youth Action Committee, as well as people in leading businesses. I ask them, 'What are people talking about in the boardroom?' and they say 'housing'. The unaffordability of housing is a cancer in our society, particularly in Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that the government has taken action on housing in a number of its budgets. But my question to the government is: why can't it do more in particular areas? I acknowledge that the government has provided some state incentives to build more housing, but the evidence is suggesting that housing approvals are going in absolutely the wrong direction. My concern is that the incentives, which I thoroughly support the government bringing in, are not actually meaningful if the states don't believe they're going to meet them—and it does not look like the majority of states will meet them at this stage. So, my first question to the government is really: shouldn't the government consider strengthening the incentives to the states to deliver on their housing commitments? And that is in terms of, firstly, rental rights, because in my state of New South Wales we have no-fault evictions, which we know undermine rental rights. Secondly, it's about how to strengthen the incentives so that the states approve more homes. It is critical, and I don't believe that the government is doing enough in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second question I have to the government is: why won't they consider other areas of taxation in their desire to build more homes? I know, for instance, that it has been estimated that reforming stamp duty—which is a state tax but where federal support would be needed to actually make meaningful changes—would, in New South Wales, allow another 300,000 people to be homeowners, if we move from a stamp duty regime to a land tax regime. I'm sure that the government has seen the modelling in relation to this. This is a change that would fundamentally make a difference. Why isn't the government making the case for tax reform on those issues and other issues to make owning a home more achievable for more Australians?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next question goes to the supply constraints in the housing sector at the moment. I was speaking with a builder the other day when I was at Rose Bay ferry. He's a major builder, and he said: 'We can't get the people. We are having to compete, at the housing level, with the infrastructure level.' I note that in this budget there's $97 billion towards infrastructure investment over the next 10 years. While I support the intent of infrastructure investment, the challenge is that at the moment we are absolutely constrained on the supply side in our ability to deliver housing and infrastructure, and, in that choice, I believe that we need to step into housing first. So my question to the government in relation to this is: why didn't the government consider pulling back on some of its infrastructure investment, at least in the short term, to get through the supply side constraints that we are facing right now in our ability to build new homes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I just want to make an observation on infrastructure more broadly. Often people say, 'If you want to spend more money, where would you save it?' The example for me would be in infrastructure spending, but part of that is because we do not have good cost-benefit analysis in relation to the impact of our infrastructure on the economy. Every dollar counts, and I know that the assistant minister probably understands this more than anyone else in the country. Every dollar counts, and if we are not spending the big money in infrastructure well then we are wasting money. A recent review into the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects identified deep concerns with the level of due diligence, lack of data collection and outcomes analysis, and lack of clearly defined expectations for making investment decisions. The review said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This undermines the Commonwealth's capacity to be an informed investor in land transport infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it extremely concerning that we are spending money that is driving up the costs of both building housing and building infrastructure but we are doing this on projects that don't have a solid cost-benefit analysis. So my final question to the government is a question I've raised before: why won't the government commit to rigorous cost-benefit analysis of all infrastructure projects that can be compared and then prioritise its investment based on those that have the strongest evidence behind them in making a difference to the Australian economy?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I8M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  Some budgets age well and some budgets don't age very well. Joe Hockey's budget in 2014 certainly didn't age very well. Most of the measures had been abandoned within the year. In the UK, Liz Truss's budget didn't age very well in 2022, and within a month it was clear that her measures were disastrous. But other budgets do age well, and events validate their measures and show them to be right for the times. The third budget of the Albanese Labor government, now just a few weeks old, has been validated by subsequent events and judged to be right for the economic conditions that we find ourselves in. Most of the criticisms of that budget that we heard very strongly over the last couple of weeks have been shown to be relatively unfounded. Let's go through some of those criticisms one by one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, we were told that the energy relief that was provided to all Australian households in the form of a $300 rebate would be inflationary. This was probably the dominant topic of commentary around the budget—that this measure, which the government felt was so important to help people with the cost of living, would ultimately be detrimental because it would push up inflation and interest rates. Well, we had an adjudication of this yesterday. The Governor of the Reserve Bank sat in a Senate estimates hearing, and here's what she said about the measure: 'It is helping people who clearly are hurting at the moment, but I don't think it's material in terms of our forecasts for inflation.' So, in spite of all those fears and concerns and that scare campaign about the impact of that $300 payment leading to higher inflation and higher interest rates, the Governor of the Reserve Bank has completely debunked that and said that it won't impact her forecasts for inflation and obviously, therefore, can't impact the trajectory of interest rates. So that's a measure that, despite criticism at the time, has aged pretty well. The criticisms have been proved wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the second-most trenchant criticism of the budget at the time of its announcement, was that it was a big-spending budget. The shadow Treasurer, on 14 May, said, 'This is a big-spending con job.' He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Labor has added $315 billion of new spending, at a time when we need restraint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, that criticism has not aged well over the last 48 hours. The Australian economy, as predicted, has been very weak in the last quarter. And, while two weeks ago the shadow Treasurer wanted a bigger budget surplus and bigger budget cuts, I doubt he would say the same thing today in the face of a weakening economy. Now he has to acknowledge that budget cuts would have had a devastating effect on the economy and would have been completely inappropriate for the economic conditions that we find ourselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the third-biggest criticism of the budget, was that it would have a negative impact on real wages. Again, the Governor of the Reserve Bank gave strong testimony on this just this week. The governor said that real wages have been negative—she was referring to the previous decade—but then said, 'We expect real wages to start to rise basically from now.' She went on to say, 'They are rising now.' So the Governor of the Reserve Bank's verdict on real wages growth and the economy over the last 10 years is that we've come out of a very dark tunnel, a period of significant low—in fact negative—real wages growth, but we can see the light at the end of that tunnel. Labor's policies have brought real wage growth back, and we expect to see the pay packets of workers moving forward in real terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of these criticisms have proven over the last two weeks to be unfounded. In fact, the budget has done a good job of managing what many commentators call the narrow path. The narrow path involves working to bring down inflation over the course of this year without crashing the economy. We're really proud to say Australia remains on that narrow path while many other countries have fallen off it. There are recessions in Britain, in Japan, in New Zealand, in Finland and in Ireland, but Australia remains capable and is showing that it can bring down inflation without leading to a large spike in unemployment or a serious economic downturn. That's why this budget has proved to be right for the times and why it has suited the economic conditions of the moment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Like many people in my electorate of Indi, I am distressed and appalled by the ongoing conflict and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. The recent attacks on Rafah have left many Australians, myself included, with feelings of despair. I am appalled by the ongoing deaths, including those of women and children; the suffering of innocent people; the destruction of critical infrastructure, including hospitals; and the obstruction of food and medical supplies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday, I attended a presentation by Australian doctors who'd recently returned from working with Medecins Sans Frontieres in Gaza. The firsthand accounts, photos and video footage were harrowing. These horrific images of death, disfigurement and malnutrition will never leave me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in Indi have written to me about the situation in Palestine—in fact, more people have written to me on this issue than on anything else in this term of parliament. I take the advocacy from my constituents very seriously as their representative. These emails and powerful advocacy are part of the reason why last year I wrote to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and called on the government to call for an immediate ceasefire, and why I have voted multiple times in this parliament on motions in favour of a ceasefire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I continue, I must make it clear: I condemn the attacks on Israel on 7 October by Hamas, and I call for the return of all hostages. In not dismissing the decades of history in this region—the generations of hurt—I acknowledge this current conflict was triggered by those awful events. But the months of violence that have followed since can no longer be tolerated by the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the foreign minister's statement this week calling for the violence to end and the framework plan for an end to the conflict offered by President Biden to be accepted by both sides. All sides of Australian politics need to add their voices to support this deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many of my constituents, I want the government to take a stronger stand against the actions of the Netanyahu government. There is a time to be measured, a time to be restrained; that time has passed. There must be consequences for this ongoing violence, which has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the same as 'siding with Hamas'. It's not that simple. The expectations of a democratically elected state are vastly different to those of a terrorist organisation. There is a strong and legitimate peace deal on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent days I spoke at length with a constituent who has been campaigning for peace. She felt powerless. She felt helpless. She asked me, what more could she do? She asked me to do more. I respect and hear her and all of those that write to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made my position public in local media and written multiple letters with my crossbench colleagues calling on the government to reinstate funding for UNRWA and to support the work of the International Criminal Court. While I've taken actions available to me as an elected member of this place, I understand that there are members of the community in Indi who would prefer I had taken a different approach—that I had been more strident, more loud and more public in my advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elected officials have a responsibility in how they use their platform. It is a responsibility I take deeply seriously. We must ensure our words are never used to incite further conflict and threaten the precious social cohesion of our multicultural nation. I would never wish my words to be used as weapons. It has been of great concern to me that it appears that some political actors from extreme perspectives have used this conflict to further their own aims. The rise in antisemitism in Australia is deeply disturbing, as is the increasing intimidation directed at the people of the Jewish faith. While I believe in the right to peaceful protest, when the line is crossed into violence, it must be called out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These political attacks are having a real impact on communities, including on the physical and mental safety of people from across our diverse multicultural community and on MPs and their staff. It is in this context that I have not felt it possible as a member of this place to engage in public-facing debate that is safe, constructive and contributes to an end to this horror. It is past time to replace political attacks with applying every ounce of our influence to finally achieve an end to the bloodshed in Gaza through an enduring peace deal, one that ultimately achieves two states, Palestine and Israel, living safely and securely. This war must end. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  We know that people are dealing with cost-of-living pressures, and I am acutely aware of the impact this is having on families on the Central Coast. That is why our government's No. 1 focus is delivering cost-of-living relief. Labor's tax cuts deliver money back into the pockets of every Australian taxpayer from 1 July. These tax reforms mean a fairer tax system. In my electorate of Dobell, 88 per cent of taxpayers will receive a greater tax cut than under the plans of the former Morrison Liberal government. This will mean a nurse at Wyong Hospital earning $76,000 will receive a tax cut of $1,579, and a tradie from Warnervale earning $110,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,429. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also delivering a $300 energy bill rebate for every household on the Central Coast. Households in New South Wales are paying some of the highest electricity prices due to the mismanagement of the former Liberal state government. This is an example of the long-term impacts of government decisions. Our energy bill relief will help ease some of the pressure on household budgets. Every Central Coast household will see a $75 reduction off their quarterly bill, totalling $300 over the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Central Coast, TAFE has long been an important pathway to secure work and a steady career. When we came to office the Albanese Labor government introduced fee-free TAFE. In 2023 alone, more than 150,000 people across New South Wales enrolled in a course through our fee-free TAFE program. Cheryl wrote to me and said: 'I'm enrolled in my diploma of nursing at Wyong. The fee break made this more accessible for me and many others.' She went on to say, 'Many of us work in aged-care and disability sectors and are working towards bettering ourselves and using our new skills to be better at the roles we are currently in.' Lauren also said, 'I am currently undertaking a fee-free course and will be starting a new job teaching at the Grove Studio in Gosford later this year.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE is changing lives on the Central Coast and opening new opportunities for thousands of people to upskill or retrain. That is why in 2024 we announced 300,000 fee-free TAFE places and in the recent budget we announced a further 20,000 fee-free TAFE and VET courses in housing and construction. This will help grow the pipeline of skilled workers to build houses in the future, and we know how essential this workforce is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election I joined Dr Gordon Reid to commit that, if elected, Labor would establish two Medicare urgent clinics on the Central Coast of New South Wales, one in the north and one in the south. These clinics are for urgent but not life-threatening conditions—a cut, a break, a fever. Towards the end of 2023, the Umina Beach and Lake Haven Medicare urgent-care clinics opened. Since opening in November, the Umina clinic has seen more than 4,400 presentations and, since opening a month later in December, the Lake Haven clinic has seen more than 6,200 presentations. At Lake Haven, 98 per cent of people were referred directly home, taking significant pressure off the Wyong emergency department. Lynne said, 'My friend visited last week and was treated very quickly—all bulk-billed.' And Lynne's right: all visits to Medicare urgent-care clinics are 100 per cent bulk-billed. All you need is your Medicare card. With the success of the 58 Medicare urgent-care clinic that have been rolled out across the country, we're establishing 29 additional clinics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, our government is making sure that all Australians have access to mental health care and support. Our $290 million investment in headspace is growing the network to 173 locations and expanding existing services, including in Bendigo. Locally, the coast now has three headspaces: Gosford, Lake Haven and Wyong, which our community fought for over many years and which I was proud to deliver when we came to government. We're also rolling out a national network of 61 Medicare mental health centres offering free, walk-in mental health support without the need for an appointment. This includes locations in Tuggerah and West Gosford on the Central Coast. With a near $30 million investment, we're building on the former Head to Health model, so every Medicare mental health centre has a psychologist and a psychiatrist on call.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I rise today to speak about the childcare and aged-care industries in my electorate. They're crucial services. I'd like to thank everybody in those services. They look after us when we're born, and they look after us at the end of our lives as well. But, in regional electorates like mine, the pressure points have quickly devolved into breaking points. If you were to read media reports, you would think that everything has been solved in these industries, but in fact it is quite the opposite. The crisis has not been fixed with changes to the childcare rebate system and with increases in the rate of pay for specific aged-care workers. Whilst it's very much appreciated, it didn't fix the overriding systemic causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single day I receive emails and calls describing the frustration of parents who are unable to find childcare places to allow them to go back to the workforce, which they desperately need to do in this cost-of-living crisis. They absolutely need to go back to work to adequately provide for their families. What we have seen is not a decrease in the cost of child care; the costs have actually gone up. But, regardless of whether or not the costs have gone up or down, it doesn't help if you can't actually secure a childcare placement in the first place. That is what we're seeing across the regions. I've heard stories from frontline workers, police officers and nurses who actually arrange makeshift family day care centres so that, when one is at work, the other one looks after their children and vice versa. There are other stories, like the one about a mother driving 50 kilometres from Kempsey to Port Macquarie because that's the only placement she can find for her child, but what that does is add hours and hours of driving to her week, not to mention the cost of the fuel on top of the cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, after hearing all of these stories, some time ago, I had a roundtable to see if we could establish the root cause of this problem and understand what was going on and also to see if there's anything that I could do as the member for Cowper to help. However, what I heard was that, as a result of the population boom during and after COVID in the electorate, we have more families in the region than ever before. At one centre in Coffs Harbour, there is a waiting list of over 170 families vying for limited spaces. In Kempsey, over 200 are on a waiting list. I'd assumed that these centres simply needed more space. But what I found is that each centre was actually only working at 60 to 70 per cent capacity, leaving obviously 30 or 40 per cent that had potential to offer more to the community. The issue is the lack of staff. They simply cannot get staff in there. When we look at those pressures on the workforce, we quickly see the same things emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it's the churn to the NDIS. We have been talking about this for the past couple of weeks. I've spoken about it many times before. It is simply untenable. The NDIS is dragging people away from these industries because it pays more, the work is flexible and the conditions are better. We've also seen the rorts. I'm not suggesting that the people leaving the industries are rorting the NDIS, but it's completely untenable. I know we're looking at addressing this. I know we're looking at changing it, which is a good thing. The same thing is happening in the aged-care industries. People are leaving to go to the NDIS. But we're also seeing school care workers going to become primary teachers because they get paid better, they don't work as much and the conditions are better. So we need to do much better for those critical workers in both the childcare and the aged-care industries.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  The Australian community benefits from an Australian government that works hard to steer our country through tough situations while setting us up for the long term—setting us up to be a fairer, healthier, stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive nation. The Australian community benefits from a government that is clear about its commitments and delivers on those commitments. That's what Australians voted for two years ago, and that's what's being delivered by the Albanese government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of coalition incompetence in which wages had fallen to the lowest proportion of national income in our history, we went to the election with a commitment to get stagnant wages moving again, to make life better for working Australians and to help those who face disadvantage. That's why we've supported significant increases in the minimum wage. That's why we've improved bargaining conditions, so that real wages are rising again for the first time in a decade. That's why we've delivered pay increases for workers in aged care and child care—because those workers are in low-paid feminised industries and because the people who provide vital care for the oldest and youngest Australians deserve a decent wage. That's why we've increased support through the social safety net, especially for older unemployed Australians and for single-parent families. That's why in consecutive budgets we've increased Commonwealth rental assistance by 40 per cent, the largest increase in 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went to the election with a commitment to make sure that Australia is not left behind as the world undergoes a transformational shift in energy generation, distribution and use, a shift which itself is absolutely necessary as an urgent response to dangerous climate change. That's why, in the first months of the government, we legislated net zero by 2050, we increased Australia's Paris climate agreement emissions reduction pledge by more than 50 per cent and we set an ambitious target of 82 per cent renewables by 2030. That's why we reformed the safeguard mechanism, strengthened and expanded the water trigger under the EPBC Act, provided $20 billion for the Rewiring the Nation project, opened the way for Australia to benefit from offshore wind power for the first time and created Australia's first National Electric Vehicle Strategy. All of those things together have delivered an increase of 25 per cent in renewable energy generation already. That's why, as we respond to the impact of climate on our environment, we've delivered, as promised, the legislation to create Australia's first environmental protection agency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We went to the election with a commitment to once again take up Labor's mantle as the party that built Australia's unique foundation of shared wellbeing, our public health and education systems—the opportunity for everyone in Australia to go to a school or a hospital for free. That's why we have delivered the largest decrease in the maximum price of medicines on the PBS in the history of the PBS. It's why we've tripled the bulk-billing incentive. It's why we've delivered 59 Medicare urgent care clinics so that people can get treatment for urgent non-life-threatening issues on an after-hours basis simply by presenting their Medicare card. It's why we are now adding another 29 clinics to that program. This is a smart, new kind of healthcare option that reduces pressure on our hospital emergency departments. It's why we're working with the states and territories to get our public schools to 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard. Happily, Western Australia will be the first cab off the rank in that regard thanks to $770 million in federal funding, so that schools which need it most reach the 100 per cent standard in 2025, with all schools to reach the standard in 2026. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-four months ago, right around the country, Labor asked for the responsibility of forming the Albanese Labor government. We made that pitch to the Australian people with a clear sense of the hard work that would be necessary to deal with urgent problems like inflation and the costs of living, and with a clear sense of the hard work that would be necessary to tackle big picture and longer term challenges in areas such as health, education, climate change and the environment. We made that pitch on the basis of a clear program of priorities, knowing that you can't fix everything at once, yet you mustn't waste a moment in getting things done in the national interest. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the things I've already mentioned, you can add the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission; you can add 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave; you can add the first consecutive budget surpluses in nearly 20 years; you can add bringing the gender pay gap to its lowest recorded level; you can add delivering the full value of the stage 3 tax cuts as promised but delivered in a form that is fairer and better, with more relief to 84 per cent of low- and middle-income earners at a time when people are doing it tough. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago, Australians voted for a government that would serve their needs and advance our national interest through hard work, focus, integrity and a responsive day-in day-out application to delivering on the commitments that we made to them. That is precisely the record of the Albanese Labor government.</span>

They failed on their experiment to get the Voice up. They've clearly failed in relation to the management of the immigration portfolio. But to this day the one that is the most staggering—and the one that is actually hurting Australians the most, I would suggest—remains the way that they are mismanaging the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw yesterday that the ABS confirmed that economic growth was just 0.1 per cent over the first quarter of the year and that it had slowed to just over one per cent over the last 12 months. The Treasurer confirmed that the economy is barely growing. That's true, Captain Obvious, because even a doctor of spin can work out, based on that data, that things are hardly moving in the right direction. So many people out there in the community have no optimism left. The Albanese Labor government are all out of answers on how they are going to address this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have seen their take-home pay shredded by homegrown inflation that has been acted on by the Reserve Bank. The Labor government have added an additional $315 billion in spending since coming to power, but I question what we actually have to show for it. What we know is that the average Australian household with a mortgage is more than $35,000 worse off under Labor than they were two years ago. That's right—$35,000. That has a real impact for young families. It means going without fresh fruit and vegetables in favour of cheaper options. Kids might be missing out on sporting events or learning opportunities. People have had to make sacrifices, and its impacting the quality of life that Australians can enjoy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's inability to address inflation over the last two years has resulted in persistently high interest rates on mortgages. The flow-on effect for those in the rental market has been equally punishing. After a dozen interest rate rises, how is Labor tracking? The national accounts confirmed that inflation actually increased even further in April. We are literally heading in the wrong direction under this government. Whilst the word 'inflation' is thrown around, the Treasurer himself is quite 'deflated', because he knows that things aren't actually getting any better. While the government delivered a lucky surplus on the back of strong royalties from resources they, ironically, are trying to phase out, they will be back to their large deficits in this coming financial year. With budget after budget ahead relying on a big-spending agenda, how can Australians feel optimistic that inflation, interest rates, their mortgages and the cost of living will ever come down?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This cost-of-living crisis that's gripping our nation is one of Labor's own making. The former coalition government presided over the longest stretch of continuous economic growth in the developed world. Meanwhile, interest rates stayed at historic lows, mortgages were manageable and people got ahead. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer simply do not share the priorities of or understand the average Australian. They really just don't get it. In just another slap in the face for Aussies doing it tough and paying record-high tax—</span>

                  </a>  Just before we were interrupted by that division, I was talking about the economic mismanagement of this government. In another slap in the face for Aussies doing it tough and paying record-high taxes, this week we've had it confirmed that the NDIS and social services minister, Shorten, has not only presided over a $40 billion blowout in his department but hired a speech writer for $610,000 over two years. I think someone did the maths on it, and it actually worked out to be $22,000 per speech, which is an incredible service provision at an incredible cost. Australians don't really understand how that can fly when they themselves are doing it so tough. What it really shows is that the Albanese Labor government are clearly out of touch with what's going on with Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  On a cold, rainy night in April, I laced up my boots and trained with the De La Salle Football Club senior women's team, the Guns. As a rank novice, my intimidation melted away with the warmth and encouraging words from the girls. Students, nurses and engineers turn up after a long day at work to learn some skills, have a workout and have some fun. Despite a long day and the inclement weather, I ended up with more energy after training. The mood was buoyant because this team plays like a team and opens its heart to anyone willing to have a go. Under the watchful eye of coach Johnno, the girls hone their skills and tactics. This game is no spectator sport; it is demanding both mentally and physically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">De La Salle Football Club is a community icon. It is 70 years old and led by the indefatigable Phil Proy and a team of legends, from coaches and physios to sponsors. Their partnership with Korowa Anglican Girls' School creates an entry into this sport, ironing out the hesitancy girls experience, when boys look like they were born for it. I look forward to seeing these young women in action at a game, and I'll be cheering them on in colours and in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a shot of joy, you can't go past toy libraries. Perhaps that is the reason all three toy libraries I visited in Higgins were packed with parents and littlies. Carnegie, Malvern and Pied Piper in Ashburton have a diverse array of toys and something for everyone, parents and kids alike. At a time when the cost of living is challenging and we are trying to live sustainably, borrowing developmentally appropriate toys makes great sense. These toy libraries have a focus on quality and repair, making them terrific examples of the circular economy. The toy libraries of Higgins operate through a low-cost model with low-cost membership fees, volunteer shifts and volunteer committees. They are also a place for connecting and for forging bonds. It's wonderful to see that Stonnington has opened a branch in Prahran catering for families settling into the newly developed social and affordable housing. My sincere thanks to the people who make these toy libraries tick. You are what education sustainability and connection are all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to visit a Lighthouse home in my electorate and to hear about their Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program. This home came about thanks to the determination of Higgins parent Amy Eade and her colleagues at the Lighthouse Foundation. Amy partnered with Caulfield Grammar, who, in an extraordinary act of generosity, donated a house to the Lighthouse Foundation. With a focus on youth homelessness and keeping young women out of harm's way, whether that be from family violence, human trafficking or forced marriage, the Lighthouse Foundation does vital work that resonates with community, especially young people. The Lighthouse Foundation, now 30 years old, is about creating the village when the familial one is either absent or has broken down. Trained youth workers are a constant presence, helping young people stabilise their lives and find a pathway. This is the difference between a life spiralling out of control and one that finds meaning. Homes are set up in strong communities like mine. It means that clients can access that critical infrastructure that makes a life sing. They also benefit from living in a stable, safe and productive community; in short, the environment itself has that therapeutic effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's national plan released in October of 2022 sets out a vision to end gender based violence in one generation. This worthy ambition demands a whole-of-society effort, including place based interventions in partnership with strong organisations and communities. Government alone cannot do this. I commend Amy and the team at the Lighthouse Foundation, as well as lion-hearted schools like Caulfield Grammar, and I would encourage other organisations to pay it forward.</span>
