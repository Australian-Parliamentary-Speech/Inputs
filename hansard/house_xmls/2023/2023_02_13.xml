              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Parental Leave</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the email dated 19 December 2022, concerning Petition EN1838—Extending parental leave to stay at home dads.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As announced in the October 2022-23 Budget, the Albanese Government is introducing a number of changes to improve the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Under these changes, the existing two weeks of Dad and Partner Pay will be combined with the 18 weeks of Parental Leave Pay to create a single payment. This is in recognition that parenting is an equal partnership and families should be able to choose how they balance work and care arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Paid Parental Leave scheme is intended to give working families the financial security to take time off work to care for their baby at home during the early months of their child's life. The Paid Parental Leave work test is designed to ensure the payment assists parents who have an ongoing attachment to the workforce, while providing flexibility so that working parents who are part-time, who are between jobs or who have some break between working days can still be eligible.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Subject to the passage of legislation, from 1 July 2023, the Paid Parental Leave scheme will be made more gender neutral by allowing either parent to claim Parental Leave Pay first, which will make it easier for fathers to access the payment. The changes will also allow eligible fathers and partners to access the payment irrespective of whether the birth mother meets the income test or residency requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the case that a birth mother is not eligible for Parental Leave Pay due to the work test, the non-birth parent or partner will be unable to access Parental Leave Pay. This setting supports two key objectives of the Paid Parental Leave scheme: supporting working families where both parents have a connection to the workforce, and supporting the health and wellbeing of birth mothers and children. Birth parents may still access Parental Leave Pay in the case that the non-birth parent or partner does not. While this is not entirely gender neutral, it is essential to retain this feature to support the health of birth mothers and children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also introduce a $350,000 family income test to the scheme's eligibility criteria. Under the new arrangements, parents will satisfy the income test if they meet either the individual income test (currently $156,647) or the family income test. This will expand eligibility to the scheme, ensuring families where the birth mother is the primary income earner can access Government-funded leave, while also ensuring lower income birth mothers are not precluded from the scheme solely on the basis of their partner's income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for writing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 22 June 2021 to the Minister for Employment, Workforce, Skills, Small and Family Business, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, regarding Petition EN2627. Your correspondence has been passed to me for response in my capacity as the Assistant Minister to the Minister for the Public Service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition expresses concern regarding age diversity and discrimination within the Australian Public Service (APS) and seeks change to legislation to include reference to age discrimination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APS is committed to building capability through diverse workforces and inclusive workplaces. I acknowledge that it is critical to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APS has experienced significant demographic changes over the last 40 years. In particular, the span of ages and number of generations in the APS has increased. Forty- seven per cent of the APS is now aged 45 years and older and the average retirement age has increased to 61.5 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Delivering for Australians Report </span>is part of the Government's commitment to building the capability of the APS workforce in order to better support Australians. The Report recommends strengthening the APS by recruiting, developing and promoting more people with diverse views and backgrounds. The Secretaries Board is overseeing a range of actions to increase APS diversity and inclusion. This includes doing more to retain and recruit older Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Legislation currently exists to support diversity in the APS. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Service Act 1999</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Public Service Commissioner's Directions 2016</span>, via the APS Employment Principles and the APS Values, recognise the need for diversity and the requirement to provide workplaces that are free from discrimination.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age Discrimination Act 2004 </span>prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age. It applies to young and older workers alike. This Act makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age when advertising jobs; during recruitment and selection processes; when making decisions about training, transfer and promotion opportunities; and in the terms, conditions and termination of employment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Caps on superannuation contributions are a longstanding feature of the system and reflect the fact that superannuation is intended to be used to fund retirement rather than for other purposes. Currently, individuals can make concessional (before tax) contributions to superannuation up to an annual cap of</span>

These caps are indexed in line with wage growth. Individuals can utilise unused portions of their concessional contributions cap under the carry-forward arrangements. This arrangement allows individuals to carry forward any unused proportion of the $27,500 concessional contributions cap for up to five years, if they have a superannuation balance of less than $500,000.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is deeply concerned by the current situation in Afghanistan. The early days of the Taliban regime have not generated confidence. The acting Cabinet is unrepresentative, excluding women and major ethnic groups. Reports of widespread rollback of the rights of women and girls, including the reintroduction of restrictions on their access to education, services and public spaces, is disturbing.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will judge the Taliban regime by its actions and work with the international community to ensure they meet their obligations and commitments. It is essential that the Taliban prevents the resurgence of terrorism. I will continue to call on the Taliban regime to uphold human rights for Afghans and strongly condemn all forms of violence and discrimination, particularly against minorities, women and girls.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 September, I announced Australia's commitment to contribute $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan from 2021-24. This includes around $65 million in immediate lifesaving assistance in Afghanistan and support to the neighbouring countries hosting Afghan refugees. In addition, $35 million will be programmed to address the protracted impacts of the humanitarian crisis out to 2024. Australia will work through trusted UN humanitarian partners.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021, regarding petition EN3199 on options for assistance and logistical support to armed groups within Afghanistan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is very concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. The acting Cabinet is unrepresentative, and there are reports of a widespread rollback of the rights of women and girls. Nevertheless, supporting armed opposition groups would only fuel further violence and exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation. Ultimately, Afghans must lead the effort to settle the form of their government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's longstanding policy is to recognise states, not governments. The Australian Government does not extend or withhold formal recognition to new governments. Australia will judge the Taliban regime by its actions and work with the international community to ensure they meet their obligations and commitments, including to prevent the resurgence of terrorism and to uphold human rights for all Afghans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 September, I announced Australia's commitment to contribute $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan from 2021-24. This includes around $65 million in immediate lifesaving assistance in Afghanistan and support to the neighbouring countries hosting Afghan refugees. In addition, $35 million will be programmed to address the protracted impacts of the humanitarian crisis out to 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding Petition Number EN3340 on Tigray, Ethiopia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is gravely concerned by the conflict in Ethiopia, and the dire humanitarian situation this has created for many Ethiopians. I have made my concerns known on many occasions and continue to call for all parties to the conflict to end hostilities and reach a negotiated solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The findings of the Office of the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights-Ethiopian Human Rights Commission joint investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Tigray are deeply concerning. All parties to the conflict are implicated, and it is essential that those responsible are held to account for their actions. Australia co-sponsored a resolution at the recent Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council on Ethiopia, establishing a committee of experts to investigate and report on human rights abuses during the conflict.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is responding to the humanitarian situation in northern Ethiopia. We have provided $3 million to the World Food Programme to respond to food insecurity and $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to help address the needs of the most vulnerable, including supporting survivors of sexual violence. Australia has also deployed humanitarian specialists to key UN agencies in Ethiopia to assist with the humanitarian response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia continues to raise concerns regarding the conflict directly with the Ethiopian Government and at the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Security Council.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, originally directed to the former Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the Digital Economy, Senator the Hon Jane Hume, concerning Petition EN3360 and the impact of recent reforms on the cost and accessibility of financial advice. As the petition was not addressed by the previous Government, your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to ensuring Australians have access to high quality and affordable financial advice. It is for this reason that we have supported the independent review by Michelle Levy which considered how the regulatory framework could better enable the provision of high quality, accessible and affordable advice—the Quality of Advice Review. Ms Levy provided her final report to me on 16 December 2022. The Government will look to respond to the review after considering Ms Levy's recommendations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Relevant to this petition, the Quality of Advice Review considered the fee disclosure and consent requirements, including those implemented in response to Recommendation 2.1 of the Hayne Financial Services Royal Commission. The Quality of Advice Review also had regard to the Design and Distribution Obligations as they apply to financial advisers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Levy took a thorough and considered approach to the review including holding more than 100 roundtables and stakeholder meetings and considering more than 300 written submissions. The Government looks forward to engaging further with industry as it develops and implements its response. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 November 2021 regarding the petition for the recognition of genocide against the Yazidi community (reference: EN3404).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the horrific experiences suffered by the Yazidi people at the hands of Da'esh, including targeted killings, kidnapping and sexual violence against women and girls.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2018, the Australian House of Representatives adopted a parliamentary motion condemning the atrocities perpetrated against the Yazidis by Da'esh, specifically those committed during the Sinjar massacre in August 2014, and recognising the importance of justice for Yazidi victims and survivors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's position is that a determination of whether genocide has been committed is a matter for independent determination in the appropriate courts. There have been a small number of instances where Australia has labelled events as amounting to genocide following a finding by an international court or tribunal or a UN-mandated fact-finding mission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2017, Australia stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe ISIL may have committed genocide against Yazidis in Northern Iraq. This statement followed conclusions in the 2016 report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that actions by ISIL against the Yazidis of Sinjar amounted to genocide.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate Australia's strong support for the Yazidi community. Since 2015, Australia has resettled over 5,500 Yazidi refugees through our Offshore Humanitarian Program. The target of the resettlement program has been female survivors of Da'esh captivity, and their immediate families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also continues to raise our concerns for the suffering of the Yazidi community in various international fora, including most recently on 7 July 2021, in a national statement at the Interactive Dialogue on the Syrian Commission of Inquiry at the UN Human Rights Council.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Once a site was allocated, the department would set hard deadlines on vaccine providers to contact the DSP from the point of allocation, to ensure no unnecessary delays.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The department received weekly End-of-Day and scheduling reports to monitor the scheduling and completion of clinics for allocated sites.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 14 February 2022 regarding 'Petition EN3548' (the Petition), as received by the Standing Committee on Petitions of the House of Representatives. The Petition requests that the House of Representatives mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all public servants including the staff of members of Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You have referred the Petition to me as the Minister for the Public Service, being the responsible Minister for the administration of the matter raised in the Petition. The referral to me has been made pursuant to Standing Order 209(a) and (b). I respond to the request in the Petition on behalf of the Government and have provided some advice below concerning the steps taken to ensure the health and safety of Government employees and their clients, in response to COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consistently supported and strongly encouraged all Australian Government employees, including staff of members of Parliament, to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This is reflected in the Australian Public Service Commission's (APSC) Circular 2021/01: COVID-19 vaccinations published on 8 February 2021. This Circular requires agencies to provide maximum support to enable employees to get vaccinated, including paid time off and covering reasonable travel expenses. Additionally, as the Circular notes, Australian Government employees are expected to comply with the terms of relevant state and territory government COVID-19 related public health orders. This includes any applicable orders mandating vaccination as a prerequisite for attending and performing work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APSC on 6 October 2022 also published <span style="font-style:italic;">Circular 2021/09: COVID-19 vaccination policies in Australian Government workplaces, </span>which states that it is the responsibility of individual Agency Heads to consider the extent that lawful and reasonable directions are necessary to require their employees, or a subset, to get vaccinated in the absence of an applicable public health order.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This Circular also notes that any decision by an agency head to issue a direction to their employees to get vaccinated should be supported by a comprehensive risk assessment and be tailored to each agency's specific circumstances. This includes consideration of work settings, work health and safety obligations, transmission risks and other relevant factors. In this respect, Government employees are subject to the same work, health and safety requirements as employers in other sectors and must ensure a vaccination mandate imposed on employees is lawful and reasonable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Government employers have also been incorporating a variety of measures to ensure the health and safety of their employees and others in the workplace such as clients. These efforts go beyond encouraging vaccinations and mandating vaccinations in limited circumstances, and include remote working, social distancing, occupancy limits, office cleanliness guidelines, requirements around the wearing of masks and the use of physical barriers in customer-facing work. For example, in January and February 2022, agencies have largely returned to working from home arrangements in response to the evolving Omicron variant, where operational requirements allow.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am confident these measures and efforts, coupled with the Government's strong encouragement to get vaccinated, will limit the potential for community transmission of COVID-19 in Australian Government workplaces, particularly those that are public facing. In fact, I am very pleased to note that there are already high rates of vaccinations (two Therapeutic Goods Administration approved doses) against COVID-19 (for persons aged 16 and over) across Australia (94.01%) and, in particular, the Australian Capital Territory (greater than 99%), where a large numbers of Australian Government employees work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I want to thank the members of the public who wrote to the Committee to raise the Petition and their genuine interest in ensuring Australian Government employees and the community they serve are protected against COVID-19. The Government and its employers remain highly engaged in our ongoing efforts to limit the risk of transmission in Commonwealth workplaces.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding petition EN3917 concerning Professor Sean Turnell. As with the many expressions of support for Professor Turnell since his detention, this petition confirms the depth of community backing for him.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the concerns for Professor Turnell's welfare during his detention in Myanmar: concerns we share absolutely.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know from my statement of 6 February 2022, the Australian Government considers Professor Turnell's detention to be unjust. We reject the allegations against him.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you that our advocacy for Professor Turnell's release continues without pause. As I do personally when I speak to my counterparts in the region and more widely, Australian officials throughout our diplomatic network take every opportunity to press Professor Turnell's case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means the regime in Myanmar can be in no doubt about the importance and urgency with which Australia and the international community view Professor Turnell's release.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using diplomatic and defence channels to ensure our messages are heard by the regime in Myanmar. It can be in no doubt about Australia's views.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our calls for Professor Turnell's release are also backed by Australia's international partners, many of whom know Professor Turnell through their own support for Myanmar's development.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, our Embassy is providing Professor Turnell with all possible consular support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While my privacy obligations prevent me from sharing further details, I can assure you that the Australian Government stands by Professor Turnell and his family.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 on behalf of the Petitions Committee, reference number EN4048, regarding Australian Defence Force (ADF) assistance during natural disasters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The prime role of the ADF is the defence of the nation. The ADF has however been actively involved in supporting the communities affected by natural disasters continuously since late 2019. It does so as part of the Commonwealth Government's support to state and territory governments, who have primary responsibility for responding to natural disasters. You would be aware the ADF has effected this type of support from time to time for disasters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recently, the ADF established Operation FLOOD ASSIST 22-2 as part of the whole of Commonwealth Government response to flooding in Victoria and New South Wales. The support provided by the ADF included flood preparations, sand bagging, welfare checks, evacuation support, logistics and road clearance, as well as early recovery support. Rotary wing aerial support included rescue support, damage assessments and logistics support to isolated communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is worth noting that the Report of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disasters of 20201dentlfied tha<span style="&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xA;  ">t-</span></span>
            </p>

                </span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"7. </span>7 <span style="font-style:italic;">Generally, the public perception was that the ADF could assist in every aspect and was always </span><span style="font-style:italic;">readily available.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">7.8 This is not, in fact, the case. Nor is it a reasonable expectation of the ADF. "</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the ADF is postured to support the response to emergent domestic crises, the provision of prolonged support—particularly in non-core roles—is adversely impacting on preparedness, operations, regional engagement, retention and modernisation. This coincides with a period of strategic uncertainty and increasing security-specific demands on the ADF, particularly in the India-Pacific. As the Royal Commission noted in its Report-</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"7.16 The ADF has finite capacity and capability. The capacity and capability of the ADF to respond to natural disasters can be affected by its commitment to its priorities, both domestic and international. The ADF should not be seen as a first responder for natural disasters, nor relied on as such.</span>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">"</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This accords with the Government's view that the ADF needs to be the responder of last resort, not first resort.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government works closely with the states and territories affected to understand the nature and extent of the impact, and to respond accordingly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In accordance with the Australian Government Crisis Management Framework (AGCMF), National Emergency Management Australia (NEMA} coordinates the Commonwealth approach to preparing for, responding to, and recovering from crises. During a natural disaster, state or territories request Commonwealth assistance, including ADF assistance, through NEMA. These requests are made when the emergency response authority has exhausted their capacity to respond, or cannot respond in sufficient time, or they require a specialist response that only the ADF can provide. Defence maintains short notice, specialist capabilities that may, under Commonwealth direction, assist civilian communities and civilian authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence remains postured to provide additional support to Emergency Services upon request through the National Emergency Management Agency</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 20 September 2022 to the Hon Kristy McBain MP, Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and Territories, regarding Petition EN4060, requesting telecommunications companies fix poor mobile reception in Lucas, Victoria. Minister McBain has referred your letter to me for response, as the issue raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns expressed by residents in Lucas about poor mobile coverage in the area. Following your correspondence, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts contacted Optus and Telstra regarding the level of mobile coverage in the Lucas area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Optus acknowledges that the Lucas area experiences mobile coverage and capacity issues. This is exacerbated by the amount of growth and development in the area. However, Optus has three new mobile base stations proposed for the area which it expects will provide new coverage and reduce mobile traffic at existing sites, assisting with coverage and capacity limitations currently being experienced. The three proposed base stations are Lucas—proposed completion date quarter one of 2023; Alfredton South—proposed completion date quarter three of 2023; and Alfredton Reserve—proposed completion date quarter two of 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra also acknowledges that growth in the Lucas area has been significant and it has been working for some time to find accessible land to build new mobile infrastructure to improve services to the area. However, finding accessible land that will provide the desired service outcome for residents of the area has been and continues to be a challenge for Telstra.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra understands the need for infrastructure to provide improved mobile service in the Lucas area, and has been working closely with the local council and community representatives to deliver a viable solution at a suitable site. Through this process, Telstra has now identified a potential site candidate for a new base station, and submitted a Development Application (DA) to council on 13 October 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this time, Telstra is unable to provide a clear timeframe on completion of a new base station subject to obtaining the required DA approvals, as well as the scale and complexity of undertaking associated work such as site access, and connection of power and backhaul.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding existing coverage in Lucas, there are a number of factors that can influence mobile coverage. These include capacity issues as previously identified, local terrain and other physical obstacles such as trees and buildings (including their internal structure) that may interrupt the signal received from the nearest mobile base station.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The mobile network operators (Optus, Telstra and TPG Telecom) have products available to improve mobile reception, including the use of an external antenna or authorised repeater.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Wi-Fi calling is another option available on the mobile carrier's networks for use with a compatible device allowing some customers with a broadband connection to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. This can be particularly helpful for people experiencing poor or no mobile coverage inside their home, by providing an alternative form of com1ectivity. People can obtain accessories and advice on the best solution by contacting their service provider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NBN Co Limited website indicates that the National Broadband Network (NBN) is now available in Lucas, with construction unde1way in the newer areas. If Lucas residents have not done so already, they may wish to contact their preferred retail service provider regarding broadband connectivity. More information can be found on NBN Co's check your address webpage at www.nbnco.com.au/connect-home-or-business/check-your-address.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to increasing connectivity, bridging the digital divide, improving mobile coverage and protecting communities against natural disaster.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is investing over $2.2 billion into regional telecommunications over the next five years. This includes $656 million under the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia (the Plan) and more than $1.6 billion to improve NBN services across regional and remote Australia. This represents a major increase in regional communications funding and one of the most significant commitments to regional communications since the establishment of the NBN.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Plan, the Government has committed $400 million to improve mobile coverage along major regional roads, in under-served regional communities, and to improve mobile network resilience. A further $200 million will be available for place-based regional connectivity projects, $30 million to improve on-fa1m connectivity and $20 million for an independent audit of mobile coverage to establish an evidence baseline to guide and better target future priorities. These programs are under development and will provide opportunities for further digital projects to be undertaken in regional Victoria to improve connectivity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also providing $6 million to further support regional, rural and remote Australians by extending the Regional Tech Hub (the Hub), a platform serving as a trusted source of free and independent advice on telecommunications services. The Hub can assist Lucas residents troubleshoot and identify solutions to existing connectivity issues. This funding extension will continue to provide better consumer awareness and improve their connectivity literacy, to ensure rural and regional communities can get connected sooner.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Hub is managed and operated by the National Farmers Federation, in partnership with the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, and includes a website, online helpdesk, phone support line and social media access through Facebook and Twitter. Information on the Hub can be found on its website at www.regionaltechhub.org.au or people can contact the hotline for assistance on 1300 081 029.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 on behalf of the Petitions Committee reference number EN4069, regarding military conscription and gender parity. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I wish to clarify that this response relates to the broader underlying issues touched on by the petition and should not be seen in any way as an endorsement or approval of the language of the petition, which many Australians could view as offensive or hurtful. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes that maintaining a well-trained and highly professional Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the most effective way of delivering on Australia's Defence requirements. The nature of military service in the current environment is such that our service personnel require substantial training to enable them to operate in complex and </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">varied situations. To train civilians or even a conscript force to a competent and safe level would require significant resources and take those highly trained and experienced personnel away from their primary role of delivering Defence capability to the nation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not plan to introduce military conscription. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence continues to make substantial progress in addressing a range of issues relevant to people who are currently under-represented in Defence, including women, Indigenous Australians, people with disability and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All Australians can pursue a career in the ADF based solely on considerations of eligibility and suitability—including aptitude, physical capacity and potential. All ADF employment categories are open to women, including combat roles. Defence does not discriminate on the basis of gender for any role in Defence and increasing female representation within the ADF continues to be a priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government agreed to the removal of gender restrictions from ADF combat roles in September 2012. On 1 January 2016, Defence began direct recruitment into all combat role employment categories. Defence exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act were withdrawn in 2018.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 1992, the ban on same-sex attracted men and women serving in the Australian Defence Force {ADF) was lifted, and in 2010 the ban on transgender individuals serving was also lifted. The removal of policies previously banning these individuals allows LGBTI ADF members to serve openly, without fear of losing their career and marked the beginning of a journey, reflecting Defence's commitment to a fair, inclusive and equitable workplace.</span>

Army achieved the 15 per cent target of women's representation in February 2021 and has set revised targets of 18 per cent by 2025 and 20 per cent by 2035.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4471 and EN4472 on introducing a new $5 banknote featuring Steve Irwin. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Reserve Bank has decided to update the $5 banknote to feature a new design that honours the culture and history of the First Australians. This new design will replace the portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The other side of the $5 banknote will continue to feature the Australian Parliament.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bank will consult with First Australians in designing the $5 banknote. The new banknote will take a number of years to be designed and printed.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN4502 requesting that all minors (that is children under 18 years of age) in Australia receive bulk-billed treatment from specialist paediatrician consultations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare is the Australian Government-funded universal health insurance scheme. It was introduced in 1984 to provide Australians with high-quality and accessible health care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MBS bulk billing arrangements are set out in section 20A of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Health Insurance Act 1973 </span>(Act) which serves a long-standing policy objective of limiting patient expenditure on medical services by ensuring that medical practitioners receive the certainty of payment in exchange for restraint on the fees they charge.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government sets the Medicare benefit for each service, health practitioners are free to set their own fees for the services they provide. This includes bulk billing the patient at no cost, or charging the patient an out-of-pocket amount.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In considering whether to charge a payment to an individual patient, and the level of any fees above the Medicare benefit, the Government encourages providers to consider a patient's personal circumstances when making decisions about the fees they charge.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also assists patients with their out-of-pocket costs through a number of Medicare safety nets, including the Extended Medicare Safety Net (EMSN). The EMSN provides an increase in benefits of up to 80% of the out-of-pocket costs for a patient once the threshold has been reached, including a lower threshold for concessional patients. All out-of-pocket hospital costs (the difference between the Medicare rebate and the amount a doctor charges the patient) counts towards the EMSN.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study, and is sustainable for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Age Pension is a targeted payment to support a basic, acceptable standard of living for seniors who are no longer expected to work to due to their age, and who are unable to fully support themselves due to their limited income and assets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a non-contributory social security payment, the Age Pension is not based on past income or contributions, or taxes paid during a person's working life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Payment is also subject to having income and assets below certain limits. Providing targeted assistance is consistent with the basic principle that individuals should be required to draw on their own resources before calling upon the Government. This also ensures that the Government is able to meet important budgetary objectives, such as spending on health and education, while keeping taxes low.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition suggests changing the eligibility criteria for the Age Pension to limit it to those who have worked for over 20 years.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providing an Age Pension to people purely on the basis of their employment history is inconsistent with the principles of social security in Australia. The Age Pension provides targeted support to senior Australians with limited means.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Age Pension is part of the broader retirement income system, which is funded through a mix of consolidated revenue, employer contributions and employee contributions. The system is based on 3 parts, or pillars:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">People who have a lengthy employment history may benefit from the first 2 pillars (Superannuation Guarantee and voluntary savings), which provide a comprehensive framework for retirement savings.</span>

Because of the timing of committee meetings over December and January, there are no petitions ready to present. However, the holiday period did not show any reduction in the number of petitions and requests. There are currently 75 petitions on the website open for signatures that will be presented in future sitting weeks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2022 there were 171 outstanding ministerial responses to petitions that had been presented in the previous parliament. Late last year, the committee conducted a review of responses that had not yet been received and sent out reminders to ministers of their obligation to respond to petitions. This obligation comes from the House and includes petitions that were referred to a former minister or former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reminders led to an increase of responses to older petitions from current ministers. The review has also resulted in a few responses from previous ministers coming to light that had not yet been presented. These responses are being presented today. The committee is checking its processes to ensure all responses are presented in a timely way in the future.</span>

This will be the first time in 24 years that Australia will have a referendum. A lot has changed in 24 years, including how our elections are run and how voters engage in elections. It is important that Australians continue to have an electoral system that is modern and that meets our current-day needs. The bill referred to our committee for consideration does this work. It modernises the way referendums are run so that this year, when Australians go to vote, they'll have a voting experience very similar to last year's federal election, including early voting centres and postal voting, a timely count of ballots, and transparency when it comes to authorisation of campaign materials, the financial disclosure and foreign donations framework and matching measures in the Electoral Act.</span>

The committee heard there was important ability in holding this referendum for us to update the experience of voters and bring it into line with their experience of voting in a federal election. The AEC told us that, essentially, this means that when people go to vote their experience will be very similar to what it was on election day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard there are further opportunities that should be considered as part of the referendum experience to build on our modern electoral system, to allow especially for improved enfranchisement and participation particularly amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The current rate of enrolment amongst Indigenous Australians is around 82 per cent nationally. That is not good enough. The AEC is confident that trials of new measures will further boost enrolment in coming months. The AEC told the committee it saw opportunities in this referendum to improve this participation. That includes conducting remote area mobile polling for up to 19 days ahead of the referendum date; trialling the provision of secure telephone voting in certain circumstances; and providing for secure on-the-day enrolment, enabling a potential new voter to cast a declaration vote that is admitted to the count once their enrolment is approved and processed. The committee urges the government to give serious consideration to supporting these measures that improve participation and enrolment. It is critically important that we allow all Australians to have their say as part of this referendum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also considered how information has been and should be provided during a referendum. There were a wide range of views the committee heard on this, including both for and against the use of the traditional yes/no pamphlet. Some legal and constitutional experts told the inquiry that, in the past, the pamphlet has not worked as intended to. Professor George Williams noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The pamphlets are often full of not only misleading statements but sometimes lies that we know to be false.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He added that he supported the removal of the pamphlet but was troubled that merely removing it was not enough, and that we should look at what we replace the pamphlet with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Anne Twomey said that such pamphlets have previously been used to provide the community with emotive, misleading and inaccurate statements. She said she wouldn't mourn the loss of the 'yes' or 'no' case but stressed there was a need for something substantial to replace it. Others stated that the pamphlet remains a valuable document for voters, providing them with the views of their elected representatives. The Australian Human Rights Commission said the pamphlet was an official source of information that summarises the key arguments for and against. The Central Land Council expressed concern that, without a physical pamphlet, older people and those in remote communities might feel they didn't have reliable access to information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While views on the pamphlet varied, there was widespread agreement about the need for information to educate and inform voters about the referendum and help them make up their minds. That's why the committee recommends the government considers how best it can ensure all Australians are provided with clear, factual and impartial information as part of the referendum. This includes, and the government has announced that part of providing this information will be, a yes/no pamphlet. This will be coupled with broader efforts in providing the information Australians will need to feel assured they have been informed before they go to the polls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  On behalf of opposition members of the committee I make a few comments on the tabling of the report. There is a dissenting report. The previous speaker has just foreshadowed the government's position regarding the formal pamphlet. There was a lot of hot debate and a proposition of potentially removing that tradition. It seems the government's position has changed on that, which we welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an inquiry into the machinery of referenda perpetually into the future; this could be a statute that applies to many referenda into the future, and it shouldn't be narrowly viewed specifically towards an imminent referendum related to the constitutional amendment for the Voice to Parliament. Regardless I don't think the fundamental principles of how we conduct referenda in this country should differ, no matter what the question is. It's highly concerning to those of us in the opposition to see propositions—and we, in our dissenting report, indicate we don't support the proposition—of not having a proper, formal case protected through legislation for each side of the proposition to change the Constitution in any case in which we are looking to change the Constitution. That is proposed in this legislation, and we are very much opposed both to not having a formal 'yes' and 'no' case and to not properly financially resourcing each of those cases. Obviously that principle must include equal financial resourcing to each case. Of course, the particular legislative instrument to hold any particular referendum tends to encapsulate how the government intends to resource those cases, but we believe that should always involve equal funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really concerned, frankly—we all have political experience in this chamber—that any attempt to rig the system and to suggest or make changes that some people might believe are designed to facilitate a certain outcome is actually going to achieve the complete opposite political objective. We understand that the public funding of 'yes' and 'no' cases is always going to be a small proportion of the total amount of resources deployed into a campaign. That's the case in our actual elections, as we know. So there is going to be a 'yes' campaign and a 'no' campaign in any referendum, including for the Voice to Parliament. If it becomes the position of the parliament to change the law to remove the tradition of providing taxpayer resources equally to each of the cases, I think the damage to any effort to change the Constitution will far outweigh whatever resourcing an argument against changing the Constitution would have provided in the court of public opinion through the expenditure of those funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are opposed to the principle but also quite surprised that there is anyone who thinks they are helping an outcome to be achieved by starving it of taxpayer resources. It's going to achieve the opposite result. It is very difficult to change the Constitution. We know that. We've got a lot of evidence. We try, but it rarely occurs. At the most recent time, the republic referendum in 1999, we had formal, official 'yes' and 'no' cases, and appropriate financing was provided towards that. I think that any kind of trickery or rigging of in the system and effectively trying to advantage one side of a debate over the other will only increase scepticism amongst the people of the country and will only contribute to the defeat of whatever proposition is put to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be difficult to change the Constitution any time we try, no matter what the proposition is. Why you would want to add and be saddled with the additional challenge of having made a legislative change that unwinds the precedent of supporting proper debate on changing our Constitution in this nation is absolutely mystifying to those of us in the coalition. We urge the government to dramatically reconsider the message it will send and the damage it would inflict on attempts to change the Constitution by saying we don't want to have properly resourced arguments for and against that change. I think the people will react quite strongly against that change, and it will dramatically doom future attempts to change the Constitution that may or may not have credibility, because the politicians have rigged the system against it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I'm broadly supportive of the government's recommendations in the advisory report on the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2022. In particular, I am glad to see a recommendation to support increased enrolment and participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities and the uncontroversial updating of the mechanics of how we run referenda. On a broader note, after this referendum we should do a compressive review of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to reflect the developments of the last century so that last-minute changes don't need to be made through new legislation relating to each referendum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm supportive of the somewhat vague recommendation that the Australian government ensure appropriate structures and mechanisms are put in place to ensure impartial information is made available. While I have some concerns about the veracity of the information to be included in an official yes/no pamphlet, I am not against the opposition's suggestion that having an official yes/no pamphlet may be useful for the diminishing part of our community that does not get its information from the internet. I support this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to speak briefly to the three additional comments I make in the report. It's essential that we do a better job of ensuring truth in political advertising. This is broader than the proposed Voice referendum, but concerns about racist misinformation in this context are real and sharpen the focus on truth in advertising because of the potential damage that could be done. I accept that it will be difficult to establish a robust truth-in-political-advertising regime in time for the referendum. In the short term, and so as not to interfere with the timing of the referendum, a compromise position could be to establish an independent panel to fact-check information disseminated in the referendum campaign. This panel is consistent with the government's second recommendation, to establish structures and mechanisms to ensure impartial information, and could play a role in that function as well. The panel could also play a role in determining the wording of the question, and many expert witnesses backed this idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another broad area of reform that will surface in relation to the referendum is financial disclosures. The bill recommends the same excessively high threshold of $14,500 and late timing for disclosure of who's supporting the 'yes' and 'no' campaigns. I recognise that this would create a reporting burden, but there is overwhelming community support to improve the transparency of who is funding political campaigns before we vote, and I think it would be a good idea for any organisation campaigning on the Voice, either way, to think about the fact that their support will be made public. In relation to financial disclosures, I would support a recommendation for greater transparency, in line with most states, with more immediate disclosure of all donations above $1,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For such an important referendum for the future of the country, truth and transparency are vital, and I urge the government to consider improvements to this end in the implementation of the legislation.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, with the passage of the National Anti-Corruption Commission Bill, Australians saw a glimmer of hope that this place was ready to take integrity seriously. It was a genuinely significant occasion, and, despite the flaws in the commission, the government should be commended for following through with its election commitment of legislating a strong, independent national integrity agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our work is obviously far from done because, to restore Australians' dwindling trust in politicians and the political process, we must also legislate to require truth in political advertising, enhance our media freedom laws, provide better protections for whistleblowers, and significantly overhaul our political donations framework. Which is why today I'm reintroducing the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Cleaning up Political Donations) Bill 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I say reintroduced because when I tabled a similar bill in 2022 it received no support from either major party, which, while shameful, is unsurprising when you look at the vast wads of cash the major parties received in the last financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed figures released by the Australian Electoral Commission earlier this month show an absurd amount of money continues to flow to political parties and candidates, often by big corporate entities. In the 2021-22 financial year, for instance, an election year, I might add, the coalition received $118 million in donations and the Australian Labor Party received $124 million. Which is bad enough in itself, but made all the worse by lax legislation which ensures the public doesn't know where much of that money came from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a start, the current disclosure threshold for political donations of $15,200 is way too high, and the current legislation doesn't require donors to disclose if they donate just below the threshold on multiple occasions. So in practice this means, for example, a gambling company can donate $15,199, one dollar below the threshold, on multiple occasions without the public ever knowing about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder dark money, money with no identifiable source, reached a record-breaking $119 million last year, or some 40 per cent of political party revenue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the situation in Tasmania is even more dire, where the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party didn't disclose more than 80 per cent of their donations, and the Labor party almost 90 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is plain wrong and my bill will fix it. For a start it lowers the disclosure threshold to $1,000 and requires aggregation, so that multiple donations received from the same source must be disclosed if the sum of all donations meets the threshold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also requires real-time disclosure of donations, which would be an enormous improvement on the current situation where political entities are only required to disclose donations once a year. In other words, at present up to 19 months can pass between receiving a donation and the public becoming aware of it. So, for example, Australians went to the ballot box last May oblivious to the fact that the Minerals Council gave over $100,000 to the Labor Party, and Adani gave almost $110,000 to the Queensland LNP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To remedy this the bill requires political entities to provide a return to the AEC within two business days of receiving a donation over $1,000. The AEC must then publish the information on its website as soon as reasonably practical. Problem solved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, if this bill had been enacted before the last election, Australians would have known that one of the biggest online sports gambling companies, Sportsbet, donated $278,000 to the three major parties during the last financial year or that Star Entertainment Group, which notably was found unfit to hold a gambling licence in New South Wales and Queensland, donated $212,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely voters have a right to know who has bankrolled a candidate or party before casting their vote, because the reality is that government policy is overwhelming shaped by political donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How else do you explain sluggish action by the government and alternative government on critical issues such as climate change or gambling reform? Remember, when someone hands over hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, it comes with an expectation of a return on that investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a new concept, because several states already require real-time reporting of donations, just as they also ban donations from some unsavoury sources—which brings me to the next point, donations from certain sectors and how they continue to severely impact policy and decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance I have no doubt that the reluctance of both major parties to pursue meaningful reform on climate change is influenced by the enormous amount of money they receive from the fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed analysis conducted by the Australian Conservation Foundation shows fossil fuel companies donated $1.4 million to Labor, and $900,000 to the coalition, suggesting the entities sensed a change in government. As ACF Corporate Campaign Manager Jolene Elberth notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact fossil fuel interests donated more to Labor than to the Liberal and National parties suggests the coal and gas firms sensed Labor was headed for victory and shows the whole point of companies donating to political parties is to gain access to decisionmakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This flow of money also highlights the fact that politicians and parties should not be accepting donations from sectors whose businesses cause direct harm to Australians. So that's why the bill prohibits donations from fossil fuel companies, gambling companies, liquor companies and the tobacco industry. It also increases penalties for corporations who breach electoral laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Money buys power in this country, and the bigger the money the greater the power. In which case we should all be horrified to learn of the analysis by the Centre for Public Integrity which found that, in the lead-up to last year's election, a mere 10 donors gave 77 per cent of all political donations. But my bill will put an end to that, implementing a cap of $50,000 on the total amount any one donor can donate during an electoral cycle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also why the bill implements a cap on the total amount candidates and parties can spend on election campaigns. Frankly, it's outrageous that Clive Palmer spent a staggering $116 million on last year's federal election, surpassing the unprecedented $80 million he spent during the 2019 election. Politicians should be elected on their policies, their values and what they can offer their community, not on who has the biggest war chest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And finally, the bill expands the definition of 'gift' to include any payment or activity valued over $1,000 that has the effect of materially benefitting a party or candidate. It also captures money spent to attend political fundraisers and functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community is demanding political donation reform, and many people were dismayed that the earlier version of this bill was not supported by the government and the opposition. There must not be a repeat of that. This time around, the major parties must put self-interest aside and support the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, I'd like to thank the Human Rights Law Centre, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Uniting Church in Australia for their constructive engagement on this bill. In my remaining time, I invite the member for Mayo, who is seconding the bill, to make a few comments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I rise to second the motion moved by the member for Clark and I very much support his private member's bill to clean up political donations, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Cleaning up Political Donations) Bill 2023. We now have a federal ICAC. Political donations must be the next thing we all do in this place to clean up the perception the Australian community has of us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, several members of the crossbench asked the Minister for Communications, who has responsibility for regulating online gambling, whether her position remains tenable, after it became apparent because of Sportsbet returns that she had received cash donations of approximately $19,000 while she was in the opposition portfolio, shortly before the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would allow the Australian public to see, in real time, in two business days, who is bankrolling their elected representatives by making donations of more than $1,000. I would just like to stand here and say that I have made a commitment to my community that I will not receive any large donations—no donations over $1,000. I often think that, in this place, many of us should actually stand here with jackets on—a bit like the motorsport people—that say who sponsors us, because the amount of money that flows in to members of parliament is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really do commend the member for Clark for this bill. We need to do so much more in here. With respect to capping political donations and expenditure on election campaigns, we already have that in South Australia. That does not thwart democracy. I actually think it makes our elections better. And we should do that at a federal level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually have some of the most lax political donation laws in the world, and we need to use our time in this place, in this parliament, to clean up this place. It is for the benefit of all of us, and it's to improve our standing in the general Australian community, who have very little time and respect for us. So it's a great shame that we are not doing much in this space and we are already nine months in to this political term.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Petroleum Exploration Permit 11, known as PEP-11, is a licence for oil and gas exploration off our coast, covering some 4,575 square kilometres of ocean from Newcastle, through the Central Coast and down to Manly, coming as close as within five kilometres from our coast in some areas. The area covered is home to millions of people and significant biodiversity and is a whale migration path. The community's wellbeing and local economy is tightly intertwined with the health of the ocean in this area. Last week, the Australian government and Asset Energy agreed in legal proceedings to set aside the decision made by Scott Morrison in 2022 when he secretly took on the additional portfolio of resources. This means the application to extend and vary the PEP-11 licence is back before the federal minister for determination. The Warringah community and other communities along the coast are all strongly against the application and outraged at this turn of events. Whilst this was a headache for the previous coalition government, with a love of gas but local MPs threatened by this project, the irony is that now all impacted seats are either held by Independents or Labor MPs. So the Prime Minister has a problem now. He is on the record, at numerous demonstrations and rallies, and made an election promise to oppose this project. So now he needs to make good on his promise!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, in support of the vote to debate this bill in this very place, when I should say all of the Labor members voted in support of debate on this bill, the Prime Minister stated:</span>

This bill will stop PEP-11 once and for all. It will ensure that no future applications for any reason can be granted by the joint authority or titles administrator for the area covered by PEP-11. Without changes to the legislation, the joint authority's decision could be subject to further review or challenge, and questions around bias of decisions would remain given previous statements made by the Prime Minister and members of the Labor government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a high likelihood that the proponents of the project will pursue litigation against the government regardless of the final decision by the joint authority in light of all the comments that have been made. So it is open to the government, at any time, to make laws enabling or excluding certain activities in certain areas. That is why this bill, today, provides a very clear and fast resolution to this problem. This bill states there can be no granting of any new licence or extension to an existing licence to extract oil and gas in the PEP-11 area. It also prohibits any such licence being granted in the future. So this permanently and clearly settles the issue for our communities. I urge the government to consider the merits of pursuing this route to cancellation rather than the joint authority process. Our communities were promised that this licence would not proceed. The government must deliver on its promise. </span>

In February 2020, I tabled a petition with 60,000 names calling for the cancellation of PEP-11. I have also received hundreds of emails from concerned constituents. The fact that we are here again discussing PEP-11 is the source of significant frustration and anger in our communities. I'd like to thank Save Our Coast, Surfrider, Surfers for Climate and the many other community organisations that have fought against this project. Once PEP-11 is resolved, we must turn our attention to all other exploration licences around our beautiful country. We must ban seismic testing off our coastline to protect our marine life.</span>

I rise in support of the member for Warringah's Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Stop PEP11 and Protect Our Coast) Bill 2023 and thank her for her tireless efforts to protect our environment and our climate. The licence to perform exploratory drilling and seismic blasting for oil and gas off our incredible coastline, from Manly to Newcastle, must be cancelled permanently, without any possibility of resurrection or further consideration. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After being repeatedly assured just last year by both major parties that PEP-11 was dead in the water, here we are again having the same debate about the same pristine stretch of water that hugs the coastline of our most iconic city. Here we are again, standing on this crossbench, imploring the government to take climate change and our environment seriously. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say it more clearly: the people of the Northern Beaches will never accept drilling for oil and gas off our beaches. Protecting our local environment is one of the most important issues for the Northern Beaches population, and this stretch of coastline and waterways is amongst the most stunning and special in the world. As locals we delight in swimming with the dolphins in the waves, and every year we marvel at the whale migrations. These waters are home to seals, sea turtles and penguins and many, many other sea creatures. The risk to our marine wildlife, environment and coastline from oil leaks and spills, from methane leaks and from seismic blasting is not something we will ever accept. And this is not mere NIMBYism. Repeated surveys have shown that strong action on climate change is the most important issue for the people of the Northern Beaches.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN Secretary-General has told us in no uncertain terms that the world's addiction to fossil fuels amounts to mutually assured destruction. They and the highly regarded international energy agency the IPCC have both stated emphatically that if we are to achieve net zero by 2050 there must be no new fossil fuel supply projects. However, within three months of taking office in May last year, this government announced the 2020 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release, making over 46,700 square kilometres of new acreage off the coast of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria available for exploration for gas. Forty-six thousand seven hundred square kilometres is an area larger than Belgium. And, let's be clear, there is no gas shortage in this country; it's just that the majority of our gas is shipped overseas, while Australians are left paying exorbitant rises for our own gas. Even worse than that is the fact that many of these multinational fossil fuel companies use every possible loophole and accounting trick to avoid paying corporate tax in our country, and they end up paying trivial amounts, if any. The people of the Northern Beaches do not accept new exploration for oil or gas anywhere in Australian waters. </span>

It claims to be committed to emissions reductions, to slowing global warming and to ensuring that we leave this planet in a livable condition for future generations. However, this government is not walking the talk.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a character test for the Prime Minister. It amends the Migration Act 1958 to ensure that noncitizens who are convicted of certain serious offences and pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community do not pass the character test and may be appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. Currently a noncitizen may be refused the grant of a visa or have their visa cancelled if they have been convicted of criminal offences either in Australia or overseas. The character test is set out in subsection 501(6) of the Migration Act and includes both objective and subjective grounds on which a person does not pass the character test. For example, a person does not pass the character test on objective grounds if the person has been convicted of an offence and received a sentence greater than 12 months or, alternatively, multiple sentences that add to 12 months or more. The bill strengthens the character test in section 501 of the Migration Act by providing a new specific and objective ground to consider visa refusal or cancellation where a noncitizen has been convicted of certain serious offences against Australian or foreign laws involving violence against a person, including murder, kidnapping, and aggravated burglary; non-consensual sexual acts; breaching of an apprehended violence order or similar; or weapons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was developed in response to recommendations from the 2017 Joint Standing Committee on Migration report on migrant settlement outcomes entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">No</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">one teaches you to become an Australian</span>. Recommendations 15 and 16 said that those convicted of a serious offence should have their visas cancelled under character provisions. Australians rightly expect everyone who lives here to respect our values and our laws. We reserve the right to act against those that act otherwise. The primary job of any government should be the protection of its citizens. The coalition believes that a noncitizen that commits a violent or sexual offences in Australia should lose the privilege of living here. The coalition supports a strong approach to ensuring that noncitizens that are in Australia uphold the laws of this country and are of good character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I am introducing a private member's bill, but this bill is not new to this House. In the last parliament we introduced this legislation to strengthen the character test, and I am pleased to say that legislation was passed in this place and debate commenced in the Senate, but unfortunately it did not get to a vote before the election. When this legislation was previously debated, the Labor Party supported this legislation and voted for it in this House. In February last year, the member for Scullin voted with the Coalition and passed this legislation through the House. The coalition still believes that, if you are a noncitizen and you commit a serious offence in this country, you should lose the privilege of living in Australia. The Labor Party supported the coalition's position then and it should support our position now. Nothing has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will ensure the character test aligns directly with community expectations that noncitizens who are convicted of offences such as murder, sexual assault or aggravated burglary are not permitted to enter or remain in the Australian community. This bill will provide the minister with additional objective grounds to consider refusal or discretionary cancellation of a visa under section 501 of the Migration Act where a person has been convicted of a serious crime but does not meet the substantial criminal record definition in subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister will have more scope to determine if someone has breached the character test in deciding whether to refuse to grant or cancel a visa. The bill does not dictate the outcome of the exercise of the minister's discretion. It leaves it up to the minister. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not in any way seek to undermine the courts or their role. Rather, it creates a new ground for failing the character test, based on the seriousness of the offence, which in turn is determined by the maximum sentence imposed by the relevant state and territories. It will establish a new designated offences ground in the character test. A designated offence is an offence committed in Australia or in a foreign country, punishable by at least a maximum sentence of no less than two years imprisonment, that involves violence or a threat of violence against a person; or non-consensual conduct of a sexual nature; or breaching an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person; or using or possessing a weapon; or procuring or assisting in any way with the commission of one of these designated offences. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also provides that, for an offence with one or more physical elements that involves violence or a threat of violence against a person, a person's conviction for an offence of common assault or equivalent will not be taken to be a conviction for a designated offence, unless the act constituting the offence causes or substantially contributes to bodily harm to another person, or harm to another person's mental health, in both cases either temporarily or permanently, or involves family violence, as defined by subsection 4AB(1) of the Family Law Act 1975. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Convictions for low-level assaults that neither cause nor contribute to a person's bodily harm or harm to a person's mental health, whether temporarily or permanently, will not fall within the scope of a designated offence, while also ensuring that any offence involving family violence is included. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is ready to go. It has taken into consideration concerns that had been raised by the Labor Party. It was written by the previous government under the instruction of the Department of Home Affairs.

The current immigration minister raised concerns about this bill when he voted for it in the House two years ago. Those concerns have been addressed in this legislation. There is nothing to stop him and the government supporting this bill. This is a character test for the Prime Minister and his government. It will then be a character test also for the immigration minister about how he goes about keeping Australians safe. </span>

We have seen already that, bit by bit, brick by brick, they are starting to undermine Operation Sovereign Borders. We are giving this government the opportunity to strengthen the character test to keep Australians safe. We are giving them the opportunity again to vote for a piece of legislation that they have previously voted for in this House. We don't want to hear them coming into this place and giving us a list of excuses as to why they can't vote for it this time. We need them to vote for this bill to keep Australia safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the critical decade for climate action, and the next three years will fundamentally affect our children's future. As I've said many times in this place, in order to rise up and meet this challenge, we need a comprehensive suite of policies. The parliament is off to a good start with setting a floor of ambition of net zero by 2050 and through the work of ARENA, but one of the clearest and most actionable plans we could make is to electrify everything. Improved energy efficiency and demand management can greatly reduce the challenge we have ahead of ourselves as we transition to clean energy by slashing the required investment in renewables, transmission and the distribution network upgrades. The emissions reduction we require over the next 10 years can be achieved, while controlling rising costs of living largely driven by inflationary and volatile energy prices, through electrification. It's going to make our job easier and cheaper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Discussion around energy efficiency has long been seen as the poor cousin to renewables as part of Australia's decarbonisation plans and debate. Until recent changes to the National Construction Code, Australia's housing stock has lagged behind that of many countries in terms of its thermal performance and the performance of heating, cooling and other energy systems. Quite simply, inefficient buildings are unhealthy for occupants and lead to a range of poor respiratory and cognitive outcomes, particularly when inefficient fossil fuels are used indoors for heating and cooking. Ultimately, improving energy performance is essential to decarbonisation, but it also importantly delivers cost-of-living relief, something that so many Australians are currently seeking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Electrifying everything and ensuring it is powered by sustainable and renewable energy puts downward pressure on the energy bills of Australian households and businesses. Effective measures can also make our businesses more competitive, support Australian jobs and reduce the strain on the energy system, all while reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. It sounds good, doesn't it? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what must we do in this place to deliver these outcomes for Australians? Based on the work of experts such as Saul Griffith and others, a minimum economy-wide target of 40 per cent improvements in energy performance by 2050 should be put in place. To achieve this, all new buildings, vehicles and industrial developments should be obliged to deliver net zero emission from the get-go, from energy through efficient design, electrification, on-site renewables and contracting renewably generated grid power. In addition to this, millions of existing buildings must be retrofitted through a combination of incentives and regulations in three main areas, including electrification, thermal envelopes and lowering the cost of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, electrification is crucial to delivering full operational decarbonisation of buildings, whilst also delivering health improvements by removing dangerous nitrous oxide and other pollutants associated with gas cookers and unflued gas heaters. These pollutants have been found to account for 12 per cent of childhood asthma, amongst many other conditions. In this context, I urge the government to develop, through their current review of the National Energy Performance Strategy, a specific target for electrification. Secondly, improving the thermal envelope of a building through insulation, double glazing, draught-proofing and other initiatives can substantially reduce the energy needed to cool or heat it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, efficiency reduces energy consumption and, consequently, associated bills, but achieving it may involve out-of-pocket costs. For this reason, delivery of the energy efficiency or electrification targets must include assistance for low-income households, with a particular focus on rentals and strata buildings. My electorate of North Sydney is primarily a high-density living area, with 58 per cent of private dwellings being flats or apartments and 42 per cent occupied by renters. In this context, I would support targeted incentives along the lines of the United States' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and/or concessional loan structure where repayments are made via utility bill savings for low-income families and small businesses. At the same time, I believe we must also incentivise landlords to embrace energy efficiency measures, improving the quality of their assets whilst also providing greater service and ultimately cost relief for their tenants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can clearly envisage a North Sydney of the future, with a reliable, affordable, renewable grid powering our fully electric and highly efficient homes, businesses and industry. With economy-wide targets, education and incentives, this future will be a reality.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I am very pleased to speak about an issue that is close to the heart of those who live in densely urban areas and equally close to the heart of people who live in the more rural, regional and peri-urban community that I represent, the electorate of Macquarie. There has been a decade of a lack of action on these matters, and the member for North Sydney is absolutely right to raise these things as key issues. It's something we are very focused on—getting better energy performance that will put downward pressure on emissions and energy bills and making sure that there is a plan to deliver better energy performance for homes and businesses. Both these things are key.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are we right now? Right now we are ranked at the bottom of the list for energy efficiency when it comes to housing. Of the top 25 countries for overall energy consumption, Australia ranks 18th for efficiency, or the amount of unnecessary wasted energy, lagging behind economies like Mexico, Turkiye, India and Indonesia. As Assistant Minister Senator Jenny McAllister says, we want to make every watt count. I really couldn't put it better than that. Every bit of energy matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the dubious honour of having a very highly energy efficient house thanks to a bushfire; when my house burnt down in a bushfire in 2013, in the rebuilding we were able to do some things that we weren't able to do when we first built that house in 1990. I've seen the benefits of having thicker windows—not actually by choice; they were mandated under the bushfire building codes. The skyscraper windows that I have do create a much more energy efficient environment for us, so I have lived those benefits. I'm not by any means going to recommend that as a pathway for other people to enjoy greater energy efficiency. But I certainly would like to see a whole lot of other people retrofitting or, more to the point, building places being able to build things that are more efficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my local community builders, Blue Eco Homes, is leading the country in building passive homes. They have improved fresh air, so they are great for people with health problems including asthma; they have carbon zero status; they have a reduced carbon footprint because they are using less energy; they are using sustainable materials; they are doing waste management on site; they are using energy efficient appliances and water efficient tapware. Joe and Merylese have been recognised across the country for the work they are doing. It's no surprise to me that the Blue Mountains, where we value the climate and our environment and we want to make things better, are really leading by acting on this. Blue Eco Homes were most recently winners of the HIA New South Wales region GreenSmart Sustainable Home award. We know it's possible; the challenge is to make a commonplace and widespread.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year we were able to do some significant things with state governments. In August we agreed to raise the minimum energy efficiency standards for new homes by updating the National Construction Code. That was a really practical, tangible thing to do. It means that the new whole-of-home annual energy use applicable to the home's heating and cooling equipment, hot water systems, lighting, swimming pool and spa pumps, and on-site renewable energy systems will be introduced. It will come in for most states by October this year. That will make homes more comfortable, help households with cost-of-living pressures, and support our transition to net zero. That is one really tangible example of the work this government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have the National Energy Performance Strategy. It is frustrating that we are talking about this now in 2023 when things could have happened a decade ago, but we are working really hard to catch up that lost time. The $15 million investment over four years to provide a framework for that demand-side action is going to have a long-term result, but it is going to take a long-term effort to do it. There is so much agreement in this chamber that, if we want to see emissions down, we need to support families. Our community batteries will do that. Our 85 solar banks, our solar gardens that we will roll out, will help people who might not be able to have batteries themselves. That is the sort of initiative that we will be continuing to bring to this parliament.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While campaigning in 2021 and early 2022, one of the big things I heard about from Boothby residents was the impact of the cost of living. By the time of the election they were talking to me about: the cost of power; the cost of fuel; the cost of food; the cost of school fees, child care, aged care. Everything was going up except their incomes. They knew that Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine was going to continue to impact the international energy market and that our energy market, after 22 failed plans, left us exposed to those international price hikes. And with the first interest rate rise coming through on 3 May 2022, 18 days before the election, it underlined that everything was heading in the wrong direction under the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, what we did not know at that stage was that the then Minister for Energy and Emission Reductions, the member for Hume, had hidden a power price rise that had been due for release by the Australian Energy Regulator on 1 May, 20 days prior to the election. We now know that that notification should have told the Australian people that energy prices were expected to rise by up to 30 per cent. We didn't know it because of what we are led to believe was an amazing coincidence. On 7 April, four days before the former prime minister, the member for Cook, went to the Governor-General and requested the writs be issued for the election, the Morrison government amended regulations so that the offer was not revealed until 26 May, five days after the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk to Boothby residents now, the cost of living is biting. I hear them, I see them and I care. The difference now is that we have a government that has a well-thought-through plan and is acting on it, a government that is open, honest and transparent with the Australian people. Australians don't like it when bad news is hidden from them for personal electoral gain. They like to be talked to as adults, not children. When we see the Treasurer speaking on the nightly news or on <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> over the weekend he does not shy away from the fact that things are tough. He does not shy away from the impact this has had on Australians across the country. He cares. But he also explains the importance of following the strategy to provide cost-of-living relief in a way that does not drive up inflation but instead builds productivity and builds our way out of where we are, and we know this is beginning to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy is a big ship to turn and it takes time. But when we see that the biggest quarterly contribution to inflation was the March 2022 quarter, almost a year ago under the former government, the ship is starting to turn. Our energy plan, which was passed on 15 December when parliament was recalled, is already beginning to make inroads on the energy price trajectory. The price increase hidden from the Australian public by the former government in May 2032 was 30 per cent. By December, prices were predicted to increase by 36 per cent. Less than a month later, that is now down to 23 per cent, and the key conclusion from the Reserve Bank forecast released last week was that our energy plan is starting to take the edge off the energy market. In less than a month, the plan is starting to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Australians are in good hands with the Albanese government's rigorous and meticulous three-point plan to address this wicked problem. The three-point plan is relief, repair, restraint. Relief refers to cost-of-living relief that does not add to inflation—cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE. Repair is dealing with issues in the supply chain, including workforce issues. Again, I refer to cheaper child care, paid parental leave, more university and TAFE places, and enabling those on the age pension to earn more before their pension is affected. We also backed a rise in a minimum wage because we value these often frontline workers, not forgetting they were the ones who took the risk to keep the country operating during the pandemic—shops, aged care and the like. But 10 years of deliberate wage suppression is not okay for anyone, not to forget the lack of investment in renewable energy, the cheapest source of energy and one where we would not be exposed to international price hikes. It's about time. And finally, restraint: showing spending restraint, as we did in in banking last year; a short-term boost in revenue; and targeting spending to where it will drive productivity and not drive inflation higher. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is working strategically to address the clean-up of the mess left to us by the previous Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, and we will continue to deliver targeted, responsible relief.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  The member for Boothby is new here. I give her credit for the fact that before coming to this place she was the chief executive officer of Saint Vincent de Paul South Australia and she won the seat as the first ALP member for 73 years. Well done on that. I listened very carefully and closely to her contribution. In her motion she does not mention the fact that Labor promised on many occasions—the Prime Minister, in fact, promised 97 times—that power prices would be reduced by $275. Now, that has not occurred. She mentioned the cost of living. Yes, people are paying more for rent, more for groceries, more for fuel, more for energy, more for housing, more for everything. She talks about a three-point plan: relief, repair, restraint. I heard her closely say that she hears, she sees and she cares about the people of Boothby and others when they talk to her about cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is Labor doing to address the issues? Labor reminds me a little bit of the dog which chases the car, catches the car and then doesn't know what to do with it. We heard for many, many years Labor decrying all the things we on this side were doing when we were in fact getting on with the job, even through COVID-19, of reducing unemployment to its lowest level in decades. We heard the then shadow treasurer give us the challenge and say, 'If there is one thing that the Liberals and Nationals could do, and they will be marked on this through COVID, it is to make sure that unemployment goes to its lowest levels and to make sure that they keep the doors of businesses open,' and we achieved that. We did not hear the member for Rankin give us any credit for that, but we did it. Despite this worldwide virus, we made sure that the doors of business remained open. We made sure that the cost of living was on a reasonably even keel despite the pressures of COVID. I know, right throughout the world, airline companies were going bankrupt. Not only did our planes remain in the air, but one of the airlines, Rex, even expanded. We made sure that indeed 700,000 jobs were saved through JobKeeper. We made sure there were a record number of apprentices—a record number of women, in fact—in jobs. We made sure our trade and exports covered by free trade agreements, which were around 20-something per cent when we got into power, rose to 71.3 per cent of economic activity through our trade and exports. As I say, there are 815,600 female business operators—a record.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what do we hear from those opposite? We hear them going on about a trillion dollars worth of debt. It's not a trillion dollars worth of debt. Every time a Labor member gets their talking points and reads that line out, it's not a fact; they are misleading the House. Similarly, every time they get up at the dispatch box or elsewhere in this House they should be talking about what they're doing about their $275 pledge to reduce power prices; they said they would do it, but they haven't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the test. The test for Labor, like the dog which caught the car, is: what are you doing about the cost of living? What are you doing about the rent crisis? What are you doing about pushing housing prices down? We heard the member for Macquarie, earlier this morning, talking about green efficiencies in housing. Fantastic! That's at the upper end. But, in the main, people are paying more for housing. What are Labor doing about it? They say, 'We're going to build a million social houses.' Well, good luck with that! Good luck finding the labour and good luck finding the actual timber and metal frames it takes to build a house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what are Labor doing about the power situation? They're trying to kill off coal projects, kill off gas projects and kill off what has supplied most of our energy requirements and needs over so many years. In the process they're going to kill off jobs in that sector. And you know who'll cop it in the neck? It'll be regional Australia. Regional Australia expects the Labor government, having caught the car, to now do something about it. Like the dog which wanted to catch the car, you've caught it but what are you going to do to help regional Australia and what are you going to do to help businesses and families?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  As I walk the streets of my electorate, visiting community groups, sporting organisations, businesses and of course—one of my favourite things—burger shops, the most common feedback I get is: 'Gee, you guys are doing a great job!' As a first-time MP and someone very new to politics, that is something I didn't expect to hear from locals—and it is totally unprompted when it comes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest: why wouldn't they be happy? Just months into our term we have delivered a budget that has delivered over $400 million to the Hunter electorate and much more in the wider Hunter region with my colleagues the member for Paterson, the member for Shortland and the Deputy Speaker, the member for Newcastle. But it is not just about delivering once a year in a budget; it is what we're doing day to day that matters. Childcare cost is a huge issue for families, and our cheaper childcare policy will see 6,300 families in the Hunter electorate better off. We know this will help ease the financial stress for families not just in the Hunter but right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just seen changes to paid parental leave pass through this place. These will make it fairer and encourage parents to share the caring responsibilities. But we are not stopping there; we're also extending paid parental leave to 26 weeks, giving more time to families at that important time of life when they are welcoming a new baby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are staying focused on easing pressure on families and helping Australians manage their budgets. Cheaper medicines took effect on 1 January and people in the Hunter electorate who rely on prescriptions are seeing cheaper medicines, which is saving them up to $450 per year, helping with them with the cost of living. We have 180,000 free TAFE places now available, to tackle skills shortages and help more Australians train for good, secure jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the great news continues in 2023. We will establish a national anticorruption commission. We will see 'same jobs, same pay' legislation introduced, which will ensure workers employed through dodgy labour-hire agreements receive the same pay as workers employed directly. This will deliver wage increases for people employed in a number of sectors right across the Hunter electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we introduced a package of legislation to deliver the single-biggest investment in affordable and social housing in more than a decade. It will include the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill 2023, which will deliver on our government's promise to create the $10 billion fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will establish the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund that will provide finance for projects that diversify and transform Australia's industry and economy. We have launched our National Battery Strategy, seeking feedback on how we can boost Australia's battery industries. We will soon introduce legislation around the safeguard mechanisms, which is a critical building block for Australia's progression towards net zero. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are reviewing the broken Medicare system with the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce. Gap fees have skyrocketed over the last decade. For the first time in the history of Medicare the average gap fee for a standard GP consult is now more than the Medicare rebate itself. We all know what caused that, and those opposite should hang their heads in shame. This means that too many Australians in the community simply can't get the care they need when they need it. We will fix that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't fix overnight all the problems left by the previous government, but we aren't wasting a single day. People are realistic and recognise that there is more to do. We were elected for a three-year term, and you can't get everything done on day one. There is a lot more to do as we clean up the mess left to us by the governments of Prime Ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. We will continue to deliver targeted, responsible cost-of-living relief to Australians in 2023 as part of delivering our plan for a better future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  We're reliably informed through the media that the National Secretary of the Labor Party gave the caucus a very important overview of his assessment of the public mood, the polling that they no doubt spend a lot of money on, talking about Australians and their concerns about the cost of living, and wanting to make sure that the government is seen to be understanding those challenges, listening to people and focusing on them. I suppose this motion was on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> before caucus was given that advice, but it's remarkable that, if that report is true, members of the government, like the member for Hunter, come in here and open with the immortal line, 'People stop me in the streets telling me what a good job I'm doing,' particularly when the evidence from their own national secretary is far from that being the reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People out there are really hurting right now. The government's view is that everything is awesome—like <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">LEGO </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Movie</span>—everything is going so well: 'Just steady as she goes. Keep up the good work.' That is a frightening attitude from the government when their own national secretary, their top political operator, said that people are hurting and we need to make sure we're showing that we are prioritising the challenges they've got in their lives right now. Those challenges are deep and immense. In particular they relate to the household budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, under this government, real wages are going down at the greatest rate in my lifetime. Inflation is at 7.8 per cent and wages growth is at 3.1 per cent, so under Labor there is a dramatic reduction in the earnings of the average Australian. We don't have the latest wage figures for the December quarter—they'll be out soon—but whatever the difference is between the wages growth figure and the inflation rate of 7.8 per cent is the amount at which people are going forwards or backwards. I doubt that wages grew at more than 7.8 per cent in the December quarter, and that means that, under this government, working Australians are going backwards. It seems that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have effectively conceded that that will be the case for some time into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While wages are going down, of course prices are going up—inflation is at 7.8 per cent—and interest rates are going up. They have gone up eight times under this government. A lot of people this year—800,000—are coming off fixed three-year mortgages and are refinancing. They are going to see their mortgage repayments more than double. And that's only so far. The Reserve Bank indicated, coming out of their decision last Tuesday, that there are multiple interest rate rises to come. The governor foreshadowed multiple increases. If things are already tough on the mortgage front, regrettably, for Australian families they are only going to get tougher as interest rates continue to rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing property values fall—in nominal terms, let alone in real terms. Property values are going down, but, when inflation is going up at 7.8 per cent, it means that, even if property prices stay the same, in real terms prices are decreasing. Unfortunately, in nominal terms they're going down. When you add inflation to that, there are some markets in this country where property prices have fallen by 20 per cent. So the value of your property is going down, the cost to service your mortgage is going up and your wages are decreasing. That is the reality under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, despite their big promise on power prices—to reduce bills by $275 a year—instead they are going up dramatically: electricity by more than 50 per cent and gas by more than 40 per cent. We've seen in Victoria today a major story about the huge burden in that state regarding gas prices. Regrettably that is going to be a story we consistently see going forward. The government's own plan involves those prices going up, despite their promise to reduce electricity prices by $275 a year. That's the reality under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of living is continuing to dramatically squeeze every Australian family. At the same time as those hardships are being endured, members of the government are bragging about their record in this chamber. They are talking with pride about the way in which they are managing an economy that is seeing real wages go down, the cost of living go up, housing prices fall and the pressure of mortgage payments dramatically increase month after month. Well, I have to say to the government: if that's what you're proud of, don't get too comfortable on that side of the chamber, because your time there is going to come to an end very, very soon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I won't be taking advice from those opposite about what it means to listen to the community, after a wasted decade where we have failed to act on climate, where those opposite presided over an economy that had stagnating wages at the heart of their approach to the economy, where we saw secure jobs go backwards, where we saw a failure to invest in skills, a failure to invest in sovereign capability. Despite what those opposite might desire to do in their revisionist approach to history, I'm not buying it, and I don't think people in my community are buying it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard so much destructive, divisive rhetoric from those opposite over the last 10 years. It is very serious, the damage that that has done to communities. So I am really pleased to be part of a government that is doing what we can to repair the damage that has been done but is doing more than that and actually delivering the positive change that Australians voted for on 21 May. I do not take for granted for one moment the opportunity that I have here to be part of a government, to represent my community of Chisholm. It is a great honour and a great privilege to be here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is a lot of work to do. We're staying focused on easing pressure on families and helping Australians to manage their budgets. Over the previous decade, we saw out-of-pocket costs to go to the GP soar in my electorate of Chisholm. They rose by a whopping 38 per cent. And we saw early childhood education and care costs rise by over 40 per cent. We're doing something about these critical areas. We're looking at the Medicare system and what we need to do to make the system work for everyone, and we're making early childhood education cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also made medicines cheaper. Cheaper medicines took effect on 1 January, easing some of the pressure that a lot of Australians are facing at the moment when they rely on prescriptions. Unfortunately we saw that patients were making a choice between the health care they need and providing for their families. The co-payment for general patients has doubled since 2000, and more than 900,000 Australians delayed filling a prescription or didn't get a prescription filled in 2019-20 due to the cost. All Australians should have access to universal, prompt and world-class medical care, and no-one deserves to choose between filling prescriptions for potentially life-saving medicines and providing for their families. Under the National Health Amendment (General Co-Payment) Bill 2022, which we passed, a reduction to the PBS co-payment was introduced which means that people will be paying $12.50 less per medicine. This means that people who get one script filled will save around $150 year, while those filling two scripts a month could save around $300 a year. This is going to make a difference to a lot of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cheaper childcare reforms mean that 1.2 million families across Australia will benefit from 1 July. I know that 7,200 families in my electorate are going to benefit. We have in my electorate one of the largest numbers of families who access child care in Victoria, so this is incredibly significant to my local community, and I've had many conversations with people about this. It means that costs will be brought down for families and that households will be able to have conversations about improving workforce participation for women, which is really important if we are serious about gender equality. This side of the House is serious about addressing the problems we've had with gender inequality in this nation which, unfortunately, have seen us go backwards in the global rankings on a number of key measures, and that is simply a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that electricity costs are going up for a range of reasons, including external factors such as the war in Ukraine. So we're doing what we can to take the sting out of projected price rises, and we're starting to see the effect of that. Ours is a government that doesn't waste a second in taking action that is required for positive change in this country. We know that this will help ease financial stress for families across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember very distinctly during the election campaign standing in Box Hill with the now Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and his being asked about wage rises. He backed in workers in this country and said, 'Absolutely.' 'Absolutely' is the answer to the question of whether we are going to get on and do the job needed to make this country better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  So many words, so little wisdom—the motion moved by the member for Boothby could not be further from reality. I like the member for Boothby. She comes with a great track record, and I echo the comments of the member for Riverina, who spoke earlier. There's a general rule for new members if you're going to move a motion. If the motion is so important that you've moved it in the House of Representatives, may I recommend you stay and listen to the contributions, because by leaving, you send the message that it doesn't matter. The challenge is that the motion is a fig leaf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious about delivering on the cost of living, we'd have had more from the Treasurer over the summer break than a 6,000-word ideological essay that was widely condemned and rose and then fell just as quickly. This government has failed to take responsibility for cost-of-living pressures that are rising on their watch at speeds not seen in decades. A ninth consecutive interest rate rise from the Reserve Bank shows the government is, frankly, not doing enough to put downward pressure on inflation—$50 billion of off-budget expenditure at the same time that the Reserve Bank is raising rates to stop expenditure makes this point loud and clear. You'll always pay more under Labor. It's always been the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Day after day, the Prime Minister wants to talk about everything except the cost of living, which is the No. 1 issue facing all Australians. Families, including those on double incomes, are struggling to make ends meet and having to make really tough calls just to keep their homes. They're taking second jobs. They're working overtime. They're giving up their holidays. Before the government goes on about the extra expenditure on child care, only 48 per cent of families put their children into child care. If we're going to take pressure off the cost of living for families, the government needs to do a lot more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has broken its promises multiple times—promises to take action on electricity prices. It said over 90 times that they would reduce by $275. The government said nothing before the election about increasing industrial relations and placating those in the union movement, yet that was the first issue that the government resolved on coming to power. Hardworking Australians are paying more and more on their mortgages because of the government's lack of priorities. As it stands, Australians with a mortgage of $750,000 will be paying an extra $16,000 a year in repayments. Without an economic plan, without the federal government doing its share of fiscal lifting, the Reserve Bank is having to do all the heavy lifting. Without an economic plan from this government, hardworking Australian families are struggling, and businesses will have to pay a higher price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the Treasurer said we were facing a full-blown cost-of-living crisis. Well, that has now become a full-blown catastrophe under this government, with eight straight interest rate rises leaving families paying much more. Interest rates are now the highest they have been since Labor was last in office. Inflation is at its highest levels in 30 years. An updated Reserve Bank forecast tells us inflation will be higher and for longer. Families will have to make very tough decisions now, and all the Treasurer can offer is a 6,000-word, fluffy essay about redefining capitalism. Bless him!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank says a further 800,000 Australian households will now move from fixed-rate mortgages circa 1.98 per cent on to flexible or variable rates approaching seven per cent. That is an extraordinary impost on what working Australians are facing. This government needs an economic plan. It needs to work in concert with the Reserve Bank. I admire the member for Boothby's motion; the problem is it doesn't hold true. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to highlight the importance of the Northern Territory Safe Measures Bill 2023 introduced in the senate by Senator Price with the aim to keep all people in the Northern Territory safe in relation to the consumption of alcohol and exposure to alcohol-related harm and violence. The bill was drafted in response to calls from vulnerable community members following neglect and inaction from the Northern Territory and Albanese governments. Indeed, Senator Price drafted the bill in response to a letter from nine separate Aboriginal organisations seeking urgent support from the federal Minister for Indigenous Australians after failed attempts at communicating these concerns with the Northern Territory government. Creating policy on the run without listening to the concerns of remote and vulnerable communities serves no-one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to highlight the domestic and family violence statistics for First Nations women as part of the introduction of this bill. Research cited by the Australian Human Rights Commission shows First Nations women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised and 11 times more likely to die from assault than non-Indigenous women in Australia. That is an appalling statistic. Family violence is a significant contributor to higher rates of First Nations women in incarceration and a leading cause of the removal of First Nations children into the out-of-home-care system. So it goes without saying that policy frameworks enabling and promoting a healthy and strong community are incredibly important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill addresses elements specific to reducing alcohol consumption and related harm applied in the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act 2012, which ceased in 2022. The bill highlights the need for alcohol restrictions that will include declaration of alcohol protected areas and the development of alcohol management plans which will provide that the supply of alcohol is regulated, mitigating illegal alcohol supply and providing a legal framework for prosecution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nampijinpa Price backed in calls from the community she represents, who have been crying out about a problem since the cessation of the measures and the lifting of alcohol restrictions in the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act. The bill makes provision for equitable consultation to take place in relation to alcohol protection measures to ensure that men, women, consumers of alcohol, nonconsumers of alcohol, addiction experts and the relevant Northern Territory agencies are all involved. The introduction of a requirement for an expert committee to support the development of each alcohol management plan will provide that measures designed to reduce alcohol related harm and improve quality of life are realised, such as monitoring school attendance and rates of alcohol related assaults. The need for the introduction of the bill has been demonstrated through the increased rates of crime, alcohol related domestic violence and alcohol related assaults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the recent Australia and Northern Territory government package for Central Australia came after significant public pressure on the Commonwealth to provide support. I believe that it is absolutely essential to ensure strong federal legislation and support in partnership with the Northern Territory government. Indeed, this was done under the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, which Labor allowed to lapse last year. Evidently, this was done without the relevant safety nets for communities in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory government has since announced it will introduce urgent amendments to its Liquor Act to strengthen alcohol restrictions. This is clearly highlighting the need for this type of policy to exist for certain people within the communities that need it. The Australian government has a responsibility to ensure that the Northern Territory has consistency in law and order and also policy and that punitive policies are not taken by the Northern Territory that do not address the broader context of addiction and alcohol related harm. I call on the members of this place to share the sensible view that reducing alcohol consumption and related harm should be a priority of any government and to support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  For the honourable member that just spoke before me, it is as if they had not been in government for 10 years. It was as idiotic as the member for Fadden railing about our stewardship of this economy that we are obviously picking up after 10 years of decline under those opposite. So let's just be real here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill by the Northern Territory CLP senator and federal legislation are just not necessary. It's public knowledge that the Minister for Indigenous Australians has been talking with and working with the Northern Territory government for months, as has the member for Lingiari, who has been a strong voice in Alice Springs on these issues—not just now; she has been a strong voice for the Territory since well in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a decision of the former coalition government, those opposite, that the stronger futures legislation expire on 17 July. Let's get a bit real. It happened before this parliament even met under the Albanese government. The former coalition government had years and years to plan for what to do when the legislation lapsed and, with it, the alcohol management restrictions in the NT. But they didn't plan for a transition, they didn't come up with a plan in partnership with the NT government and they didn't work to support families and communities in the NT. So that was the situation that those on this side, in the Albanese government, inherited on taking office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crime and antisocial behaviour has been an issue in Alice Springs for decades, like it has been in many other places in our nation, for all sorts of complex and layered reasons to do with the process of colonisation, disempowerment and intergenerational trauma. But those opposite want to politicise this at every opportunity. The claim that these problems have only existed for the past six months is idiotic, disingenuous and wrong. Like other states and territories across Australia, the Northern Territory government has responsibility for alcohol policy and regulation, and they are bringing forward legislation in the legislative assembly this week to revert town camps and remote communities to dry zones. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new legislation will follow a local decision-making process where communities will develop their own community action plans. Communities that want to opt out of a dry zone will need 60 per cent of the population to vote in support of the community alcohol plan. Local areas will be able to choose to remain dry or select tailored restrictions which work for them. This community-led approach is crucial—and, frankly, what should have happened in the first place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing the Territory needs is another federally imposed intervention, because we all know how the last one went. I wasn't someone working from afar; I was up close with that intervention, and I can tell you that the lack of consultation by the Howard government at that time led to a reduction in capacity in our communities. The blanket labelling of Australian men in the Territory as alcoholics and abusers did so much damage. It stripped communities and the Northern Territory government's capacity, and now we're looking at the children of the intervention. Again, it's this notion of intergenerational trauma that I think escapes those opposite. These kids have grown up in communities that are now powerless and traumatised, and they've never been given a proper chance to take responsibility, to have a say over their own lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory government has demonstrated that they are now taking responsibility and have the power to act. On 25 January, the Chief Minister outlined a number of measures to address antisocial behaviour and crime, including one sale of alcohol per day, per person, following industry guidance. Alcohol-free days are Mondays and Tuesdays for takeaways, and there are limited hours for the sale of alcohol, between 3 and 7 pm, except on Saturdays. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that in the Territory alcohol restrictions are only part of the solution. There is so much that we need to do and that our government will do in cooperation with the NT government—and that is social and economic drivers of community development. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Northern Territory Safe Measures Bill 2023 to be introduced in the Senate by Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price. When the Albanese government let the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act 2012 lapse, alcohol supply and consumption became an opt-in model. The Northern Territory government has allowed communities to be opt-in for alcohol provisions rather than the previous opt-out model. Committees were not required to have any alcohol management plans in place to support this change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This opt-in model has devastated the lives of those living in the Territory. It has left children, families and the broader community vulnerable to alcohol related violence. Since the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act lifted, there has been a devastating increase in both consumption of alcohol and alcohol related crime. Northern Territory police statistics have shown that in Alice Springs alone property offences, assaults and stolen vehicles have jumped by 60 per cent, in the past 12 months, while domestic violence assaults have increased by 48 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poorly managed transition out of the stronger futures NT legislation has not just affected the larger towns like Alice Springs but also the small, remote communities and their households, schools and workplaces. It is heartbreaking to see children wandering the streets in the early hours of the morning because it's safer than being at home. Every single child must be protected from the horrors of the abuse, neglect and sexual violence that have become out of control. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people living in these communities are terrified of leaving their homes after dark, afraid of the violence that awaits them that is fuelled by alcohol. If the horrific crimes that we are witnessing were occurring in one of our capital cities, it would be consistent front-page news. Immediate action would be taken. What the Northern Territory communities received was a fly-in fly-out meeting from the Prime Minister that lasted four hours before he held a press conference. In fact, the tennis games that the Prime Minister indulged himself in for three days following his visit lasted longer than the time he spent in Alice Springs. Four hours is nowhere near long enough to address the severity and scale of the situation occurring in the Northern Territory. The people of Alice Springs deserve better than four hours and a photo opportunity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Price warned the government of the impact in letting the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act lapse, and now the people of the Northern Territory are paying for the lack of action by this government. Labor's accusation that—</span>

                  </a>  the lapse of alcohol bans was caused by the coalition is simply outrageous. The fact of the matter is that the stronger futures Northern Territory legislation lapsed under the watch of the Albanese government, in July last year. Overnight, these communities began to spiral into the abyss of alcohol-fuelled violence and crime. The Labor government has let the people of Northern Territory communities down for far too long. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has had his head buried in the sand while alcohol has decimated the towns of the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lives of the most vulnerable people in our society are a responsibility for all of us, which is why both the Australian and Northern Territory governments need to act now and need to act fast. A more robust and all-encompassing approach must be put into place to ensure the lives of the most at-risk people are kept safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory Safe Measures Bill will reintroduce elements of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act, while also ensuring that there is a legal framework to address alcohol abuse. It will also establish requirements for the Northern Territory Labor government to work with all communities to develop an alcohol management plan for a reinstated opt-out model. The Northern Territory government must take responsibility to support the development of alcohol management plans, while also working constructively with the Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also ensure that the supply of alcohol is regulated and will mitigate the legal framework for the prosecution of illegal alcohol supply. Safe measures will also be established for those who do consume alcohol, their children, families and the broader community, while also ensuring that human rights are upheld for the most vulnerable citizens of Australia. There will be provision for equitable consultation of men and women in these vulnerable communities, not just to meet a quota, as well as a provision for a 12-month Senate committee to review and make an assessment of the effectiveness of the act in addressing the reduction of alcohol related crime and the development and implementation of alcohol management plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time for action and change. The Prime Minister stated in last year's election that he was going to become Prime Minister and that he would not go missing when the going got tough or pose for photos and disappear when there was a job to be done. Prime Minister, there is a job to be done. You demonstrated last year you can recall parliament to pass legislation in a single day. The Northern Territory Safe Measures Bill 2023 needs to be legislated now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  This bill and federal legislation are absolutely not necessary. This legislation is about federal intervention. It is about the federal parliament overriding the Territory's ability to legislate for itself. And there is absolutely no doubt that the people in Alice Springs and in the Territory right across Central Australia are doing it tough. Federal legislation, however, is only going to disempower local people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes the minister responsible for approving alcohol management plans that communities develop. This approach would mean that ultimate decision-making for alcohol management plans for communities in the Northern Territory are made in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want the Commonwealth and state and territory governments to work in partnership. We want them to work together. We want the community to be driving solutions, because we need solutions. We need solutions for harm minimisation and we need solutions for alcohol—in particular, for the health problems relating to alcohol. I can talk about alcohol-associated organ damage—particularly to do with the heart: arrhythmias; cardiomyopathy, where the heart grows and it's unable to pump properly and pump blood to vital organs; high blood pressure. If we talk about the brain, we're talking about stroke and about something called Wernicke's encephalopathy, where the brain is in a constant state of delirium. We can talk about cirrhosis and hepatitis of the liver, and pancreatitis. The health problems associated with alcohol are absolutely catastrophic, and that's why the community needs to be driving these solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Senator Price's approach is in contrast to the approach announced by the Northern Territory. They are proposing that the community alcohol plans be approved by the independent Northern Territory Director of Liquor Licensing and then be voted on by the community themselves. Communities wishing to opt out of alcohol restrictions will require a 60 per cent approval vote for the community alcohol plan to be accepted and for the restrictions to cease. Under the Northern Territory model, decision-making is within the community. As I said before, federal legislation will only disempower local people. This is a much better option, as it addresses the immediate problem while empowering communities to make their own decisions. That has not been the case in times gone by. The approach of this government has always been and continues to be focused on outcomes, not playing politics with the issue, as we can see from those opposite and as we can see from those in the other place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth has announced additional funding support for the Northern Territory to work on these longer-term social and economic issues and in particular to address the decline in service and investment that happened over the last decade under the watch of those opposite. The Australian government will invest $250 million in a plan for a better, safer future for Central Australia. This plan is going to focus on improved community safety and cohesion through more youth engagement and diversion programs.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's going to focus on better services by improving health services to address a lot of those alcohol related issues with alcohol associated organ damage and fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome, as some members may not be aware, can lead to poor concentration, behavioural issues, learning difficulties and speech and language changes. Then there are also abnormal facial features and physical deformities that occur—small palpebral fissures affecting the eyes; a smooth philtrum, which is the bit above the upper lip; micrognathia, or a small jaw, causing problems with speech and eating; and microcephaly, which is unusually small development of the head. We are preventing issues such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder by investing in the health system.</span>

This package is in addition to the $48 million investment in community safety announced by the Australian government, the Albanese Labor government, on 24 January this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  'Suffer the little children,' somebody far wiser and greater than me said. Certainly in the Northern Territory at the moment we have a crisis. Some of the most vulnerable members of that community are suffering: children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that a cashless debit card wasn't the panacea or the cure-all for all the ills in the Northern Territory or elsewhere in this great nation, but it was certainly having a positive effect. It was certainly helping some of those children who were going hungry, who were going to school without a proper uniform, without breakfast, without the proper resourcing for a good education—we know that education is the great enabler. Those children were being helped by the cashless debit card to the point where their families were finally getting the money to spend on who they should be spending it on: the kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that Senator Dodson is in the chamber. I know he is here for another reason, the anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. I appreciate that the two Northern Territory lower house members are here. I acknowledge their work to help their communities—I truly do—but we have to do much more. It can't be just partisan politics. It can't be just politicking as usual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had great dismay about the Minister for Social Services almost gloating, crowing, about the fact that the cashless debit card would be no more. I am not sure how many of those communities she personally visited. I am not saying she didn't make those trips to those communities, but I know I did. I have been to Katherine. I have been to Tennant Creek. I have been to Alice Springs. I have been to other communities in the Northern Territory and elsewhere and I saw that it was working. I heard that it was operating successfully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad that the shadow minister for home affairs, child protection and prevention of family violence has introduced this into this House, following on from Senator Price's private members' bill in the other place, an important bill. It is an important discussion to have because we need to have it. We need to address community concerns. We need to recognise the need for immediate action to address underlying issues across parts of the Northern Territory following months of escalating crime incidents. How terrible is it to turn on our television sets to watch the six o'clock news and see scenes that would otherwise belong to probably a war zone elsewhere in the world, maybe Ukraine, maybe elsewhere, but happening in the centre of Australia, happening in Alice? It's not good enough. It's not good enough for those hardworking families in those Aboriginal communities and others besides who are doing their level best to help the most vulnerable members of their community, and those are the kids. Those are the children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to Kenya late last year to look at the impending famine situation there, and you might ask: what has that got to do with this bill? I will tell you what it has to do with it. They were introducing, and it was working successfully in the early period, a cashless debit card for the 300,000 or so refugees who had gone across the border from war-torn Somalia and elsewhere into Kenya and were living in a huge camp. They found that the only way to help those people was through a system not unlike the cashless debit card. In fact, when I asked them what it was, they said that is exactly what it was; it was a cashless debit card. Go figure. We've got a cashless debit card that's working, that's operating successfully, and what do we do? Because of partisan politics, because of supposed discrimination or whatever else, we withdraw it. But we don't listen to the people on the ground. We don't listen to the mums, who are tired of the domestic violence situation in their homes and in their communities. And we don't look at those kids who were being helped, who were being helped when they went to school, who were being helped when they were playing in their communities, who were just being helped by the provisions of that cashless debit card. So I commend Senator Price and I commend shadow minister Andrews for this bill. I think it is important and I hope it succeeds.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  To the extent that the Northern Territory Safe Measures Bill 2023 and the motion that has been put before this parliament would restore alcohol-protected areas in town camps in Darwin, Katherine, Tennant and Alice Springs, they would achieve no more than carrying out what the Northern Territory government has now committed to doing urgently. In this regard, if I thought that this motion was genuine, I can tell you what Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would say to me, that they are sick of being the political football in this House. We are sick of being the political football and of the mere words that are talked about in this House. It is merely political point scoring. It is a divisive and conflict-seeking piece of legislation not unlike the negative role played by the bill's proponent in the passage of legislation which restored to the Northern Territory the right to pass its own laws in relation to assisted dying. It is nothing but a ploy to get some more east coast followers on Senator Price's Facebook page.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McPherson, who I have listened to in this chamber and who I have some respect for, has walked right in and played into Senator Price's hands. But much more importantly, to the extent that this bill seeks the restoration of the APA regime to the huge number of communities out bush that would have reverted to general restricted area status, it does. It is insane and it is vandalism. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To explain what I am talking about, we need to take a flashback detour to mid-2007, to a time we can now call the intervention. That was the sudden shock-and-awe initiative launched by the then prime minister John Howard and then Indigenous affairs minister Mal Brough, which, in one fell swoop, imposed a series of measures with the purported aim of reducing child sexual abuse in the bush. I want to remind members that in the 510 pages of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response legislation, children were not mentioned once. That is the disgrace of what occurred from those members opposite when they intervened in the Northern Territory. They stand up here and they purport to pass legislation in the interests of Aboriginal children and women in the Northern Territory, yet they have a track record of using Aboriginal women and children in the Northern Territory for political weapons. It is for their own political gain—</span>

                  </a>  No, it is not a shame. I am looking at the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs. It is a shame. It is a disgrace that time and time again this House plays politics with such an important issue. This issue needs both sides of the House to work together to try and resolve the issues that we are seeing and have been faced with in the Northern Territory for a long time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent all last weekend with the federal Minister for Indigenous Australians and met with many groups across Alice Springs and the town camps. Where was Senator Price? She was missing in action, which is what has happened over the last three months in Alice Springs. When that community called for leadership, all she wanted was to play mere politics. This is beyond the political games that get played. This is about people's lives. It is about Aboriginal women and children. There are many men who are non-drinkers, but we forget about that because of the cheap politics that is constantly played in this House. We must stop the political games. This motion is nothing more than political point scoring, and, quite frankly, Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are sick of it. </span>

I pay my respect to elders past, present and emerging, and I recommit, on behalf of the government that I lead, to the implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. I particularly welcome the members of the stolen generation who are joining us here this morning, having been at the anniversary breakfast in the Great Hall earlier on. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The traditional owners of Broome, the Yawuru, know this time of year as Man-gala. It is one of six seasons that they divide the year into, a time of heavy rain and strong winds. In Kakadu, another land of six seasons, the Bininj and Mungguy know it as Gudjewg, the true wet season. That will in turn give way in a couple of months to Banggerreng, the season of knock-'em-down winds, which will come flatten the spear grass. To the Noongar around Perth, it is the second summer of Bunuru, while to the Wurundjeri in Melbourne, it is Iuk, the season of eels. Across this continent—in the tropics, on the coast, on the islands and in the deep desert, in the mallee and the bush valleys—it is mapped out in a shifting mosaic of human knowledge. Major seasons and a supporting cast of minor seasons, all in tune with the specific language of the land and sky. Languages built over millennia and spelt out in flowers and fire, in the shifting of the wind or the vanishing of the rain, in the behaviour of animals and the movement of the stars. More than 60,000 years of wisdom from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is all around us, if we care to listen. We reflect on wisdom today. We reflect on generosity, and on the power of opening our ears and, yes, opening our hearts. As we mark the 15th anniversary of the Apology to the Stolen Generations today, we consider how it guides us as we seek solutions for the challenges of the present and find ways to shape a better future. Delivering the apology took conviction, decency and humanity. It took courage to hear it. On this day 15 years ago, members of the stolen generations came to this parliament, which for so long had cast its shadow as the pinnacle of a system that had failed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically, governments of all persuasions have failed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Yet those members of the stolen generations came here with such grace. So much had been taken from them, but their hearts had so much to give. I say to them: your courage showed us that when we're brave enough to acknowledge failure, we can find the strength to take the next step forward together. The apology was the first act on the first parliamentary sitting day of the Rudd Labor government. As Leader of the House on that day, it was certainly my proudest moment in this chamber. And from Prime Minister Rudd we heard the words that reverberated across Australia: 'I am sorry on behalf of our nation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the doomsayers, it was a positive moment for the nation. A moment of unity. A moment on the road to healing and unburdening. And for everyone who had put themselves through the ordeal of reliving their childhood—and I thank those men and women who spoke to me this morning about their experience—this was confirmation that their voices had, at last, been heard. Like Prime Minister Keating before him, Prime Minister Rudd understood that until a nation acknowledges the full truth of its history it remains burdened by its unspoken weight. In acknowledging the past, Prime Minister Rudd said we were 'laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians'. All Australians. Truth can be hard—for those speaking it, for those listening—but it is what ultimately lets us move forward as one. As Mick Dodson said about the process that culminated in the apology: 'I know of no Indigenous person who told their story to the inquiry who wanted non-Indigenous Australians to feel guilty—they just wanted people to know the truth.'<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>And to know the truth, we had to open ourselves to those voices. It's easy to say the apology didn't fix everything. It's true—it didn't. But what single thing can? What moment can? There is no step that can, on its own, get us to our destination. But we keep taking steps. And we keep walking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the apology's great achievements was to keep alive the faith in decency and the hope for reconciliation that illuminate the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The apology could never be the end of the story, but the close of a chapter—and the beginning of a better one. Not everyone supported the apology 15 years ago, though some have since expressed their regret. </span>

As of next year, the report will be issued when it was intended—in conjunction with the apology anniversary. But, as we saw when the government tabled the last report a few months ago, the gaps not only persist—some are getting bigger. The report lays out forensically one lopsided statistic after another in health, education, incarceration rates and—especially damning—life expectancy. These aren't gaps; they're chasms. </span>

It is clear that we have leapt too swiftly from a climate of forceful intervention to simply telling communities, 'You're on your own.' We are seeing this in Alice Springs—and in so many communities beyond. I went to Alice to listen, to hear from the people on the ground.

It is a concrete demonstration of how we will advance real-world solutions that improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As well as reaffirming closing the gap as a top priority for my government, our plan reflects our unwavering commitment to working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is about action, action that gives purpose and direction to our efforts to transform government and enables the full participation and self-determination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our national life. This plan also accelerates specific actions on the national agreement's four priority reforms to transform the relationship between governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, communities and organisations. The implementation plan sets out a plan for improving essential services in discrete communities and households outside town boundaries. New measures in the 2023 implementation plan include:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am optimistic about the success of the referendum because I am optimistic that Australians will support this embrace of truth, justice, decency and respect. When I think of the 1967 referendum and the apology, two great steps forward that we have taken together as a nation, I look to friends and colleagues who embody those moments. I look to my dear friend Minister Burney, who was a young child when it was decided her people were worth counting as Australians—a vote where Australians were offered the choice to right a wrong, and they seized it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I look to Senator Patrick Dodson. As a boy in Katherine, he hid in the long grass when the welfare officers and the police came to take his mates away. Think about that. What a terrifying moment for a child. What a formative moment in a life. He's seen some of our nation's story play out before his eyes. And yet Senator Dodson looks back over our modern history and reminds me that amid the wrongs, there was also such kindness. And that is the spirit of generosity that he brings to his task as the Special Envoy for Reconciliation and Implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart—a very big hearted Australian spirit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1967, 90 per cent of Australians voted to remove a harmful, discriminatory relic. In 2023, our generation can go one better. Instead of removing a provision that no longer speaks for who we are, we can make a positive change that speaks for the future we seek to build together. This can be a moment of national unity—an extraordinary opportunity for every Australian to be counted and be heard, to own this change and be proud of it and to truly live the spirit of the fair go. We are a nation of goodwill and good heart. I believe there is no challenge that is beyond us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Aboriginal people across the country celebrate the rising of the morning star, its light ushering in a new phase of life for the oncoming generation. It is a transformative time of song and celebration, marking joy in the ongoing survival of their peoples. The people of Australia, through the invitation embodied in the Uluru statement, have been asked to travel on this journey. We have a chance to add a bright new season to the calendar and a future that embraces all of us.</span>

There is a very special group of people in the gallery today, and we acknowledge those who are present in the gallery who are part of the stolen generation and thank them for being here for this 15th anniversary.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nations have complex histories defined by achievements and marked by blemishes, and our country is no exception. A mature nation, though, doesn't cherry-pick from its past and doesn't rewrite or cancel out parts of its history. Rather, a mature nation is one which speaks truthfully and in totality about its history—one which embraces both the light and dark chapters of its national narrative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have every right to be proud of so much that was accomplished by our forebears. They helped build the modern nation in which we are so lucky to live today. But we also acknowledge that our forebears committed serious wrongs. The wrongs committed against the stolen generation were acknowledged by Prime Minister Rudd when he delivered the national apology in this place in 2008. He offered that heartfelt apology without qualification on behalf of the government and the Parliament of Australia for the actions of successive governments under successive parliaments; for the laws and policies between 1910 and 1970 which saw thousands of children forcibly taken from their families; and for the hurt, the humiliation, the pain, the grief, the suffering, the loss and the indignity inflicted upon the stolen generation, their families left behind and their descendants. The national apology was a profound moment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had been affected, for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike and for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifteen years have passed since the apology, and this is an occasion for delicate reflection. The national apology was about Australians acknowledging the sins of the past—'the cold, confronting, uncomfortable truth', as Prime Minister Rudd put it—and, in that acknowledgement, accepting the flaws and failings inherent in our historical character with the maturity of a modern nation—a modern nation which sees its history in the round, successes and failures alike. As Prime Minister Rudd said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… peoples must become fully reconciled to their past if they are to go forward with confidence to embrace their future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the release of the government's 2023 Closing the Gap implementation plan today, we welcome several initiatives—in particular, more than $68 million, over two years, for support to women and children experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence, and more than $21 million over five years to support families impacted by family violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the Morrison government, which worked with governments at all levels, and the Coalition of Peaks to formulate a national agreement with priority areas of reform. The Morrison government also released the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap: Commonwealth implementation plan</span> in 2021. The plan committed more than $1 billion towards new measures to address some of the most pressing issues facing Indigenous Australians. That funding included, among other things, a $378 million redress scheme for stolen generations survivors in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory; $75 million for country boarding schools; $26 million for a city-country partnership program to improve school outcomes; and $66 million for alcohol and drug treatment services. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his historic speech, Prime Minister Rudd said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… symbolism is important but, unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For decades, coalition and Labor governments alike have been on a unity ticket to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. Whilst we welcome what improvements have been made, the conditions today in Alice Springs, as pointed out by the Prime Minister, demonstrate that the situation is, in reality and certainly by many indicators, worse for Indigenous kids and their parents than it was 15 years ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard of issues in Aurukun in Queensland, Kimberley in Western Australia and Ceduna in South Australia. Collectively, we have failed to close the gap. Despite the good intentions and deeds of so many, despite the many billions of dollars which have been invested, we've seen more and more bureaucracy, bigger and more centralised in its nature, and it's not led to better decisions. Too often, a capital city view has informed decisions, drowning out a regional and remote community view. Indigenous Australians are yearning to see action that truly makes a practical difference, for every Australian wants to see improved life outcomes for Indigenous Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this 15th anniversary of the national apology, as we reflect on past mistakes let us reflect on our present actions. I fear we are failing, again, this very day, for which a future apology will be necessary. Ironically, the situation in Alice Springs has highlighted children suffering in a harmful situation which is suffocating their chances of breaking a vicious cycle. Authorities have decided to put culture and other considerations above the best interests of those children by leaving them in harm's way. Surely and understandably, the 10-year-old Indigenous child suffering abuse in Alice Springs will, in 10 years time, ask how: 'How in 2023 did you knowingly and consciously tolerate a situation where my interests were not put first?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's our actions which make history, as Prime Minister Rudd put it. Then, it's time to think carefully about our actions, because our current actions, for all their good intent, are not bringing about enough practical outcomes for which we can all be proud as a nation. We will never as a nation create another stolen generation, but our actions can prevent a new generation from having their lives and aspirations stolen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to make better decisions which lead to better actions, then I ask of the government: bring Australians with you. Trust them with the detail. Appeal to their reason. Don't fear an informed citizenry. If you truly want to further the cause of reconciliation, please bring them on the journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak directly to those in the gallery today and further afield who are part of the stolen generation and those who are descendants or are connected to the issue. I want to say, in an unscripted way, I apologise for my actions. The Prime Minister's frequently able to point out that I didn't attend the chamber for the apology 15 years ago. I've apologised for that in the past, and I repeat that apology again today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, I had been out of the Queensland police force for about nine years, and I still, probably, truthfully, to this day live with the images of turning up to domestic violence incidents where Indigenous women and children had suffered physical abuse and certainly mental abuse. I remember, clearly, attending Palm Island, where I brought back the body of an Indigenous woman in a body bag, who had been thrust off a cliff to her death. I remember thinking at the time that those incidents were still occurring on a daily basis in 2008. The judgement that I formed was that if we were to make an apology, it needed to be at a time when we had addressed and we had curbed that violence and those incidents. I failed to grasp at the time the symbolic significance to the stolen generations of the apology. It was right for Prime Minister Rudd to make the apology in 2008. It's right that we recognise the anniversary today. It's right that the government continues its efforts, and in whatever way possible we support that bipartisan effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian wants to see a better outcome for Indigenous Australians. There is nobody I speak to around the country, regardless of their view on the Voice, who does not want to see an improved situation in Alice Springs, Ceduna or anywhere else in the country. People who have a different view about how we might get to that end point, about how we might help people along the path, are not hardhearted because they have a different view to us or a different approach to how that practical assistance might be provided. I hope that the government can bear that in mind in the current debate.</span>

I commend Prime Minister Rudd for the action he took in 2008, and I know that, as a country, we are determined to make sure that we can address particularly those issues of domestic violence, to make sure we can reduce those gaps that have widened in relation to infant mortality, life expectancy and to other indicators around education and health that must improve so that we can improve the lives in the future of every Indigenous Australian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The late, great Archie Roach first performed 'Took the Children Away' more than 33 years ago. Archie spoke of the truth that for many years was denied—denied by governments and denied by parliaments. Children were removed from their families because of the colour of their skin. And it was governments that did it. Most Australians didn't know of this reality. For decades there was a stubborn silence while many of those removed suffered a private pain of unbearable loss. It was, and is, one of the darkest chapters in our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1991, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found that of the 99 deaths investigated, 43 were people who had been separated from their families. By 1997, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them </span><span style="font-style:italic;">home</span> report, which took evidence from hundreds of people from across the country, made 54 recommendations. The report found that between one in 10 and one in three Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families between 1910 and 1970—in most of our lifetimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key recommendations was for an apology to be given by governments. Western Australia was the first state to issue an apology, on 27 May 1997, closely followed by New South Wales in June of the same year. By 2001, all states and territories had issued apologies. The only hold-out was the Australian government under then Prime Minister John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I went back and looked at some of the accounts in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them </span><span style="font-style:italic;">home</span> report—so many tales of heartbreak, of lives changed forever. One harrowing story was from Paul. Paul's mother was tricked into putting him into a home while she recovered from a serious illness. He was made a ward of the state, and his mother's consent was never sought. His adoptive family rejected him after seven months and Paul was placed in an orphanage and later with an abusive foster family. In his submission, Paul said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… my Mother  never gave up trying to locate me. She wrote many letters to the State Welfare Authorities, pleading with them to give her son back. Birthday and Christmas cards were sent care of the Welfare Department. All these letters were shelved. The State Welfare Department treated my Mother like dirt, and with utter contempt, as if she never existed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The apology delivered by Prime Minister Rudd was, at its core, about healing—healing deep wounds, closing a painful chapter of denial of our history and opening a new chapter of our collective story, a better chapter. It was about real people. To the people joining us today, thank you so much. Hearing from the Prime Minister of Australia a simple word, 'sorry'—an apology, the truth—you deserved that. You deserve nothing less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some, the apology was something to reject. And, of course, we all learn and we all grow. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his apology today. It is a good thing that we grow and we learn. But, now, we have the chance to do something practical together to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, something that will have an impact on the ground and in communities by getting behind the Closing the Gap implementation plan and by supporting, as the Prime Minister so beautifully said, constitutional recognition through a voice. To do otherwise risks repeating the mistakes of the past. So I say: don't hold us back. Let's move forward for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighteen years have passed since Tom Calma, our Senior Australian of the Year, delivered his <span style="font-style:italic;">Social </span><span style="font-style:italic;">justice report</span> urging governments to commit to achieving equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in health and in life expectancy within 25 years. It's been 16 years since governments pledged to close key gaps in life expectancy, to halve the gap in mortality rates for children and to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements within a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, governments partnered with the Coalition of Peaks to expand these targets, which now include land, languages and justice outcomes. Despite this, report after report, year after year, as the Prime Minister has said, progress has been slow, too slow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's commitment to closing the gap is unequivocal. Our commitment is to working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through the Coalition of Peaks with Pat Turner, and, one day, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's first Closing the Gap Implementation Plan details the next steps the Commonwealth will take towards achieving the targets and priority reforms of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. It includes more than $400 million of additional spending that the Prime Minister outlined. But can I focus on one of those things, because it is a whole-of-government plan that brings together in one place all of the actions that each department and agency is taking to achieve Closing the Gap. I want to focus on the first announcement the Prime Minister has made: $150 million over four years to support First Nations water infrastructure and provide safe and reliable water for remote and regional Indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace that, in 2023 in Australia, there are First Nations communities that still do not have reliable access to safe drinking water—an absolute disgrace. It is almost impossible for some people to imagine what it is like to live your whole life in a place where the water is not safe, where dialysis machines can't work because the water isn't clean enough. And we all know of the enormous problem of renal failure in our communities. I want to thank the Minister for the Environment and Water for her commitment on this. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is on top, of course, of the $250 million the Prime Minister announced as part of our plan for a better, safer future for Central Australia, where I again, with the member for Lingiari and others, visited over the weekend. We want to better coordinate with the states and territories and with our community controlled organisation partners. This is about getting things done and, importantly, for people to hold us to account. Governments are better when they listen and when they are held to account. Holding governments to account was not done in the era of the stolen generations. One wonders: what if there'd been a voice at the time? Nor was anyone listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in 2023, a new generation has the chance to do things differently, to create a better a future. It's up to a new generation of Australians to help close the gap. We are a great country, and we can be even greater if we get the next steps right by making a lasting difference through practical action—one that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians a Voice. Let us seize this moment and take Australia forward, for everyone.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I begin by acknowledging this nation's Indigenous people and their 65,000 years of endurance, resilience and wisdom. We recognise the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, on whose lands we gather, and I pay respects to members of the stolen generations who are with us and bring their own stories, experiences and pain to this gathering. You are the living witnesses to the policies that failed, and you inspire us with your indomitable spirit. And I pay tribute to my Indigenous member and senator colleagues and the Minister for Indigenous Australians, who, like her predecessor in that role, I call a friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber is not only a meeting place; it's a place of memory—of shared national memory. And we're right to remember. We remember almost a century ago, the first time the parliament met in this city, in a building like a small white wedding cake set amongst the fields of grass and dust. At that first gathering of the parliament at Canberra, thousands were invited—thousands and thousands—but not a single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person—not one. So two Indigenous men, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, took it on themselves to walk to Canberra and let their presence be known. Officialdom tried to turn them away, but the crowd demanded that they stay, and they did. Fair-minded Australians have always been on the side of the person having a go. We remember the actions of that great Yorta Yorta man William Cooper, an organiser, petitioner and agitator for change who spoke up not only for his own people but for others as well. In 1938, he protested the absence of Indigenous members from the parliament, and in December of the same year, after the events of Kristallnacht, he led one of the few protests to the German consulate decrying the prosecution of Jewish people by the Nazis in Germany. We remember the bark petition; the 1967 referendum; the arrival of Neville Bonner in the Senate and Ken Wyatt in the House of Representatives, and so many more since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And on this day we remember the apology: an apology for children taken away from parents, families, community and culture; an apology for the brothers and sisters separated; an apology for the forced relocations away from country; an apology, to use the words from Neville Bonner's maiden speech, to those who 'were shot, poisoned, hanged and broken in spirit until they became refugees in their own land'; an apology for the pain that cascades through the generations; an apology that needs to be repeated again and again, whenever and wherever Aboriginal Australians are denied the same opportunities as their fellow citizens. On days like this, for those of us without a lived experience of dispossession or loss, it's easy to speak of the past and linger there—to linger there because it is easier than confronting the present, to confront the work that we must still do. Kevin Rudd was right when he said, 'It is not sentiment that makes history; it is our actions that make history.' And that demands that we speak of the present and that we speak of the present in terms of a shared accountability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday, the Prime Minister said something to me across the dispatch box, and his words have stayed with me all weekend. He said simply, 'The member is a participant and not an observer'—a participant and not an observer. Across too many areas in government, in the bureaucracy, in the parliament and in the media, we've all become observers. Our fears have frozen us: fears about complexity and misunderstanding the interrelationship of difficult and different issues; fears of making bad situations worse; fears about unintended offence and of culturally misreading moments; fears of the stigma we create by highlighting failures. These are the fears we don't talk about but that most of us share. They make us observers, not participants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nampijinpa Price and the member for Lingiari raised the alarm about Alice Springs in their first speeches months ago—from both sides of the aisle, two Indigenous parliamentarians, participants, who have not been afraid to speak the truth: the truth about alcohol, the truth about violence and the truth about our continued failure as Australians. I pay tribute to their courage. I know it wasn't easy. I say to the Prime Minister: we all have to stop being observers—all of us. Yes, it's right to remember the past. Yes, it's right to want to change the future. But our place is here in the present, and that's where all of us are failing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen the interim report on Closing the Gap and I thank the minister's office for their briefing. On a day when we remember the failed policies of the past, I want to talk about the failed policies of the present. I want to talk about the people living in the towns and the regional areas across Australia and the intertwining of alcohol, violence and community failure. These are not easy topics to talk about. Last week, the report by Dorrelle Anderson, the Northern Territory controller, into Alice Springs was released. It makes for confronting reading, and I want to read you a few lines that cut me to my core. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The children who have been spoken to have unanimously voiced their hatred of alcohol and the harm it inflicts on their families. Their simple aspirations are to live in a 'normal place', have jobs when they are older and be able to support their families with basic needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say it again:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The children … voiced their hatred of alcohol and the harm it inflicts on their families—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">such powerful and simple words. The children are speaking truth to us, and the sad truth is it's not only in Alice Springs. I want to speak about a few other places—places where we must hear the local voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Leichhardt has told me about failures in places such as Aurukun in his electorate, where school attendance has dwindled and where the local paper says that, despite the presence of 50 police officers, residents are reluctant to leave their homes and those who do often have to arm themselves. The member for Grey has told me about the issues being faced in Port Augusta and in Ceduna. In Port Augusta, there's a large transient population, there's unrest and fear, and shopkeepers are concerned about businesses and personal safety. In Ceduna, where I went on my visit with Senator Liddle just after I became the shadow minister, where the cashless debit card provided a measure of relief, now residents are fearful about the damage being done by alcohol and fearful of speaking out publicly—fearful there might be consequences because they want to restrict the grog.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for O'Connor has spoken to me about Laverton and Leonora. In Laverton local Indigenous leaders are begging for tougher alcohol restrictions. He told me about Sarah Sullivan, an Indigenous resident who has spoken publicly about how Laverton was a great town when she grew up but how her children are experiencing something terribly different these days—children and adults being chased for money and smokes. Local voices matter, and they're just not being heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Durack has written to the Prime Minister about the Kimberley, the Pilbara and Carnarvon. The member for Durack has met with a collection of Pilbara organisations that include the Pilbara Aboriginal Health Alliance, the Youth Involvement Council, the Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation, the Puntukurnu Aboriginal Medical Service and the Robe River Kuruma Aboriginal Corporation. They show a deep concern about youth crime and the destructive trail it's leaving. The federal government invests millions in diversionary programs, and we must urgently determine if our investment is fit for purpose and whether those investments are being delivered as intended. The member for Durack says, 'Isolation is a way of life for many in Durack, but now fearful residents are further isolated, bound within their own homes, too scared to leave.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, on this anniversary, we must honour the past by answering the failures of this generation towards Indigenous children. The present, in so many regional and remote communities, is terrible. I'm not blaming the Prime Minister or the minister or the state and territory governments. This is a collective failure, and I put my hand up too and share the blame with everyone. Despite the progress in other areas, some of which is reported in today's interim <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">gap</span> report, this is an Australian failure. It's a shared Australian failure. In all too many places, alcohol is fuelling the most unspeakable crimes against women and children, and this cannot be allowed to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I support the Leader of the Opposition's call for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children. In many cases, these are the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the stolen generations. The member for Maribyrnong was right to call for a royal commission into aged care—a royal commission that Prime Minister Morrison agreed to. The Prime Minister, when opposition leader, was right to call for a royal commission into veteran suicide. Again, Prime Minister Morrison agreed to it. The Leader of the Opposition is right to call for a royal commission into the abuse of Indigenous children, and the Prime Minister should agree to it as well. Royal commissions are never comfortable—I understand that—but, frankly, they're a whole lot better than facing regional failure after regional failure and simply continuing with more of the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the minister have spoken passionately about the Voice. I share their passion, but it's in our national interest to heed the voices of Indigenous Australians that are speaking now. We must pay attention to the voices that do not already have a platform in Australian public life, and we must heed the cause of children whose simple yearning is for a normal life, the sort of life we'd hope for for any of our own children. If we're to break the cycle, we cannot afford to ignore these voices any longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us use this 15th anniversary of the national apology to recommit ourselves to action—action in partnership with Indigenous communities, with the Coalition of Peaks, with state and territory and local governments and with all Australians of goodwill. Let us all choose to be participants and not observers in the repair of our country and the reconciliation of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community has a reasonable expectation that noncitizens who seek to enter or remain in Australia are of good character are law abiding. Similarly, they expect that any noncitizens who are not of good character to be refused a visa or have any visa they hold cancelled. The character test of the Migration Act 1958 is one of the mechanisms by which government gives effect to this expectation. The character test is an important pillar within Australia's migration framework to protect the Australian community from the risks posed by noncitizens with serious criminal histories or criminal intent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 will provide a clear basis for aggregate sentences to be taken into account for all relevant purposes under the Migration Act, including the character test at section 501 of the Migration Act. This will make it clear that, for the purpose of determining if a person has a substantial criminal record, it is irrelevant whether a sentence of imprisonment was imposed on that person for one or more offences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill does not change or expand the circumstances in which aggregate sentences are considered for all relevant purposes of the Migration Act. The bill simply confirms the long-held bipartisan understanding that aggregate sentences can be taken into account for all relevant purposes under the Migration Act. In this respect, decisions made under the powers of the Migration Act will not change as a consequence of this bill. In fact, the decisions undertaken will be in a manner consistent with the government's long-held understanding and practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill responds to the recent full-court Federal Court ruling in Pearson v Minister for Home Affairs handed down in late December of last year. The full Federal Court ruled that an aggregate sentence may not be counted for the purpose of working out if a person has a substantial criminal record under the character test framework and, subsequently, that their visa cannot be subject to mandatory cancellation on this basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This judgment has created an inconsistency in Australia's visa cancellation regime, where some noncitizen offenders who, for multiple offences, receive an aggregate sentence of 12 months or more do not meet the criteria of having a substantial criminal record under section 501 of the Migration Act. Such individuals would therefore not be liable for mandatory cancellation of their visa, regardless of the seriousness of their offending. For example, a person who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 10 years for committing a violent offence would be found to have a substantial criminal record and would be liable for mandatory cancellation of their visa whereas if they were convicted for 15 years on the basis of two offences, they would not, simply because that sentence was in respect of more than one offence. Aggregate sentences are only imposed in five jurisdictions, leading to grave inconsistencies in how the cancellation framework is applied upon offenders in different states. It would be nonsensical for two people found guilty of the same offences and sentenced to the same period of imprisonment to be treated differently under the Migration Act simply because their offences were committed in different places, so the government is urgently addressing this situation through this bill, by restoring the meaning of 'sentence' in the Migration Act to the meaning that was understood prior to the Federal Court's decision in Pearson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also retrospectively amend the Migration Act to validate past decisions and actions that have been rendered invalid on the basis of the judgement in Pearson. This is important to enable those decisions that were to protect the Australian community to stand. It provides the most appropriate mechanism for the government to detain those individuals whose visas were previously cancelled on the basis of sentences for more than one offence and proceed with their removal from Australia. Where previous cancellation decisions were rendered invalid because of Pearson, they will be revalidated. This means the original cancellation decision stands. Following commencement and validation of decisions made, individuals with a validly cancelled visa will be afforded fresh review periods to seek appropriate review avenues for these decisions, if they originally had time remaining to do this prior to the Pearson decision being handed down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the Pearson judgement, the Department of Home Affairs acted consistently with an understanding that aggregate sentences should count as a sentence for all decisions under the Migration Act wherever the term 'sentence' appears. The amendments in this bill do not change the framework within which the character test operates. They allow for the continued effective administration of the powers in the Migration Act by ensuring that aggregate sentences are considered sentences, thereby restoring the ability to rely on a substantial criminal record as an objective measure for the purpose of the character test. The government is taking urgent commonsense action in order to keep our community safe. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  The opposition will be supporting this bill, but we will also be putting forward some amendments circulated in my name to strengthen it even further. The government has introduced the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023, which will amend the Migration Act 1958 to establish a consistent approach across the provisions of the Migration Act as well as the Migration Regulations 1994 in relation to sentencing for offences. As the minister has detailed, there has been bipartisan agreement for the approach that has been taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for this bill follows the decision of the full court of the Federal Court of Australia in Pearson v Minister for Home Affairs 2022. In Pearson, the Federal Court relevantly held that, in effect, an aggregate sentence, a single sentence for more than one offence imposing a term of imprisonment, does not in and of itself constitute a substantial criminal record within the meaning given by subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act, particularly paragraph 501(7)(c), even in circumstances where the sentence is to an aggregate maximum term of imprisonment of four years and three months in respect of 10 offences. The government is right to correct this, and that is why the opposition will be supporting this bill. But we will also be putting forward amendments, because the coalition supports a strong approach to ensuring that visaholders that are in Australia uphold the laws of this country and pass a character test to remain here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting thing about the character test is that it not only applies to those who break the law but, of course, also applies to those who seek to uphold it. That is why we think the government should support the amendments that we will be putting forward today. If a noncitizen breaks the trust of being allowed in Australia by being found guilty and convicted of certain serious offences and poses a risk to the safety of the Australian community then they will not pass the character test, so they should not be considered for a visa or they should be considered for a visa refusal or cancellation. When in government, the coalition was very strong on ensuring that people who wanted to come to Australia to study, work or settle here were of good character. The coalition remains of that view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, we introduced legislation to strengthen the character test, and debate commenced here in the House on a bill to do that. That bill was passed with the support of the then Labor opposition. Unfortunately, it did not get to a vote in the Senate before the election. Today, the coalition will move amendments to this government bill to strengthen the character test by providing additional grounds to consider visa cancellation where someone fails the character test. We are not saying the minister must, but we are giving the minister the option. We are giving the minister the option to be able to act on things like family and domestic violence. These amendments will provide an additional objective ground to consider refusal or discretionary cancellation of a visa under section 501 of the Migration Act where a person has been convicted of a serious crime but does not meet the substantial criminal record definition in subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act. The amendments do not in any way seek to undermine the courts or their role; rather, they create a new ground for failing the character test based on the seriousness of the offence, which in turn is determined by the maximum sentence imposed by the relevant states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing today is providing the government with two ways that they can support the opposition and our amendments. Earlier, I introduced a private member's bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2023. My hope is that that will also be supported by the government, because the private member's bill and the amendments that we are putting forward here both act in the same way. They enable the minister—and the minister is sitting here, listening to this—to act when it comes to things like murder, grievous bodily harm, sexual assault and domestic violence. It will give him the option to be able to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My hope is that the government will support these amendments, because the absolute priority of any government is to keep the community safe. The ways that we keep the community safe should be continually and consistently looked at. These amendments, and the private member's bill that I introduced earlier, follow on from the outstanding work that was done by the two previous coalition government ministers for immigration. They put a lot of time, thought and effort into how they could make the community safer. The character test was seen to have worked extremely well in this regard. But they saw a way we could ensure it continued to stay apace with the types of crimes we continue to see in our community. That is why they wanted to give the minister the option of being able to act when there was violence or a threat of violence against a person, or non-consensual conduct of a sexual nature, or a breach of an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person, or using or possessing of a weapon, or procuring or assisting in any way with the commission of one of these designated offences. This is good, commonsense policymaking. It's enabling the minister to act in these situations if the minister deems it necessary to act. All we're doing is giving the minister the option. My view is the Australian people would see these very much as commonsense amendments. My hope is that the minister will see it the same way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are a test of character. They're a test of the character of the people who come here to Australia—that they will uphold the laws of this country—and they're a character test of the government. Is the government prepared to act when people break Australian law when it comes to things like sexual offences, domestic violence or using weapons to commit a murder? I hope the government will take the right course on this action.</span>

                    <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  Although I understand what the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 hopes to do—to protect the Australian community from people who have committed serious crimes—the potential for overreach is real. Australians should be protected, and, indeed, those who have committed serious crimes should be held to account. However, we need to be able to have a reasoned discussion about how that works when it comes to a refugee or a stateless person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In effect, this bill could mean, for those who have nowhere else to go, indefinite immigration detention—even for those convicted of less serious offences. The question I have is: is that reasonable for crimes that cumulatively add up to total sentences of 12 months or more? In plain English, these could be a series of petty offences committed when the person was in their youth. We're not necessarily talking about serious offences in all cases. What other options other than indefinite detention are there for people whose sentences add up to 12 months or more? I'm aware this is on the spectrum of highly thorny moral issues, but I think we have to have a measured discussion about it because this is about the separation of powers, ministerial responsibility and proportionality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments apply to people who have an imprisonment sentence of two years or less, which, in the Australian criminal justice system, usually means their actions are on the lower end of the spectrum of offending. The government offers several case studies, from 100, reflecting serious offences, but acknowledges that this is not necessarily representative of the entire group. We know that once someone's visa is cancelled and they're re-detained as a result, it is rare and highly unusual that they're later released. This means those whose visas are cancelled on a mandatory basis are effectively in detention indefinitely, as they can't return to their country of origin, where they face persecution, and they'd be in breach of non-refoulement obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I understand it, for example, the proposed changes could see a person who as a youth committed a series of minor offences whose penalty adds up to 12 months or more having his or her visa cancelled and being stuck in endless detention, with all the mental and physical toll that goes with that. One case study suggests that a young South Sudanese man, sentenced to 18 months jail for affray, drunk and disorderly and substance related offences, who subsequently had his sentence reduced to 10 months, had his visa cancelled, spent another 2½ years in detention, was released under the judgement I'm about to discuss and now faces being re-detained under this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware that the minister would prefer not to have godlike ministerial discretion on these matters—I hear that—but this case illustrates why that discretion can sometimes be needed. I don't seek to excuse the offending. The question goes to the proportionality of the punishment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The retrospectivity of the legislation means that people who the government had released for just days or weeks and reunited with their families and communities will likely be forcibly taken back to detention. The young man I mentioned is one of them. It seems to me that's only likely to compound his trauma of war, being orphaned, traversing refugee camps and a new environment and then seeking solace in drugs and alcohol. These are human factors that this legislation does not address, and these are things that I will address in an amendment to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core of the problem here is the one-size-fits-all rejection of the Pearson judgement in which the Federal Court found that people cannot have their visas cancelled automatically and be held in detention based on an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more. The court found that mandatory cancellation should apply in only the most serious cases and that self-evidently an aggregate sentence may be arrived at after conviction of a series of lesser offences, none of which on their own could render a person liable to have his or her visa mandatorily cancelled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government seeks to reverse that position, meaning that all of those who were released after the Pearson judgement can be re-detained. As I have already said, this may be justified in some cases. Indeed, the government's argument is for public safety, which I accept in good faith because the rule of law is central to our communities and society; however, so is the separation of powers. As Hannah Dickinson, Principal Solicitor at the ASRC, puts it:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pearson merely limited the blunt instrument that is mandatory cancellation in its application to aggregate sentences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unnecessary, cruel, politicised policy-making—and in particular, the retrospective overruling of inconvenient court rulings—is a hallmark of previous governments, an approach that has harmed thousands of individuals and families, eroded the rule of law, and left Australia's migration system in disarray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To release and then re-detain roughly 100 people in the space of weeks is abhorrently cruel, and will devastate those people and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have a problem with is the blanket nature of this, with no transparency around the circumstances of those being re-detained and their offences, and no plan for what's to be done with them beyond indefinite detention. I suggest that, if the government disagrees with the decision, the appropriate avenue is the High Court, rather than seeking to overrule three judges of the Federal Court via this legislation. I also point out that, if the government is so concerned about serious offenders being free in the community now, as am I, the minister already has visa cancellation powers under section 501(3)(b) of the Migration Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much respect the minister's efforts to implement a more humane refugee policy, as evidenced by announcing a path to citizenship for temporary visa holders today. This bill, though, I think is an overreach and is at odds with that approach. I do not support it in its current form.</span>

                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023. When I first became the federal member for Riverina back in 2010 I can well recall my predecessor Kay Hull saying to me to be very mindful of writing letters of support for people who want to come to this country even if it were on a temporary basis, even if it were for a wedding or funeral, should I not know that person. She warned me because she had written a letter of support for a person to come to this nation for a family event and they absconded—they did a runner. The authorities, police and even the family couldn't find this particular person. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The local mayor had written a letter of support for this person. The local family were agitating. Of course, the local press, as you'd imagine and expect, also said, 'Why can't this person be allowed in the country just on a temporary basis, just for this event?' Of course, Mrs Hull, being the great member that she was, wrote the letter and then regretted it later. It was a valuable lesson she learnt and a valuable piece of advice she passed on to me. Sure as night follows day and day follows night, it wasn't long into my stewardship of the federal seat that indeed a similar situation arose—the same mayor, the same place, the same situation. I said no. I said no and I copped the wrath of the mayor, the press, the family and the community, and yet, in my heart of hearts, I knew it was the right decision to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members of parliament, sometimes we have to make those tough calls. Sometimes we have to make the tough decisions and not do as some people would ask us to do and not fall into the trap of succumbing to a vigilant local media who, when situations like this do go awry, are the first to then criticise and say: 'Why didn't you do this? Why didn't you do that?' It makes it difficult, particularly if the person does a runner, absconds, goes into hiding, takes up a job and goes into the black cash economy. If they don't break any laws as such—any criminal laws; they are breaking the law by staying in the country when they haven't got the visa arrangements to do so. If they don't break any actual criminal laws or commit violence, then people might say, 'So what?' But it's not 'So what?' It's a situation where we need to have the strongest possible migration laws, the strongest possible laws to keep our nation secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Keeping our borders safe and keeping the integrity of our visa system intact was one of the hallmarks of the Abbott-Truss, Turnbull-Joyce, Turnbull-McCormack, Morrison-McCormack and Morrison-Joyce governments. We kept our borders intact. We didn't fall into a situation where we took the easy out or the easy option. It's always easy when you get anecdotal evidence pushed by local media or national media, whatever the case may be, to just give in and to just say yes. But it's when these situations go astray that we are the ones who cop the blame: 'Why did you allow this person in? Why did you sign the reference to permit this person to stay, albeit briefly?' Mrs Hull's advice was sound, and so are the amendments being put forward by the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, the member for Wannon, and I support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that the government is playing a bit of catch-up when it comes to migration and immigration. We saw this just last week with the sunsetting of the situation in Nauru. I know members opposite have talked a big game when it comes to the Pacific. I know they are talking about the failure of the coalition in arrangements in all matters in relation to the Pacific. They are really pushing this point. It's on all their talking points and in all their speaking engagements. They seem to forget that there was a situation with COVID that actually prevented much of the ability to visit the Pacific islands. They seem to forget that we absolutely made sure, through then minister for health Greg Hunt, the member for Flinders, that vaccinations were first and foremost for the Pacific islands along with our own people. But the point is this: Nauru and the situation there was just completely forgotten. The other side just dropped the ball when it came to having those arrangements in place in Nauru so that our national borders were safe. Of course, they made up for it last week, with urgent emergency legislation brought into this place. Again I say they've completely mishandled that situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways and in many cases, I do worry. You only had to read the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper this morning in relation to Labor's election pledge to end the use of temporary protection visas. This paves the way for about 19,000 refugees who arrived by sea to stay permanently in Australia. I know the situation with many—some might say all—of those refugees is certainly not perfect, but what we saw when Kevin Rudd first took over as Prime Minister was that he said that there wouldn't be a cigarette paper's breadth between what his arrangements were on boat people and arrivals and what the situation was under the Howard government. Yet we all know what happened under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. What we saw was boats arriving in their numbers: 50,000 people arriving on more than 800 boats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People got so uptight, particularly on the other side, about the use of the phrase 'illegal boat arrivals'. Well, they were illegal. I'm sorry, but they were illegal. No-one denies somebody wanting to come to a country such as Australia for a better life for themselves and their children, but what we saw in many cases was people actually throwing their identifications overboard. People who had the capacity and the money to be able to try to get here by many means then arrived illegally. Then, whether it was under us or, indeed, under Labor, they were then put into situations where, yes, it was hard on them and particularly on their children, 8,000 of whom were forcibly placed in detention. Was this the fault of the government? Was this the fault of their parents? The fact is that there were 8,000 of them, among 50,000 people. The cost to taxpayers of managing illegal boat arrivals under Labor blew out by $10.3 billion. So there were 800 boats under Labor, 50,000 people under Labor, 8,000 children under Labor and a $10.3 billion cost blowout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we do? We fixed it. We stopped the boats. This was, I have to say, one of the important things that we said we'd do, and under then Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Morrison we did it. We made sure that we stopped the boats. We didn't just stop them because it was illegal for those boats to come; we stopped them to protect the people who were trying to come to Australia. And why wouldn't people want to come to Australia? It's the greatest nation on earth. It's a ticket to freedom. It's a ticket to the best life that you can possibly have in this world. Australia—make no mistake, and I know it gets talked down often—is the best place in all of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I'm deeply concerned about the impact that slashing this subsidised access to psychology sessions will have on my Redlands community, which is already severely underserviced when it comes to all levels of mental health support. </span>

Cancelling these extra sessions is going to put a strain on the already overcrowded public services, and our already extremely high suicide rate will rise.' I couldn't agree more with this mother's assessment, and I was disgusted to see the minister dismiss these concerns when asked about them in question time last week. </span>

This location was selected after a rigorous process of assessment. Unfortunately, this Labor government has sent the project back to the drawing board and is refusing to provide answers on whether the project will proceed. I'm calling on the government to restore these subsidised services and to give certainty to the Redland Bay Head to Health facility. </span>

Graeme held the position until 2001, when he was appointed a group officer within the Hunter Valley team, a position he was re-elected to until he retired in August 2019. His dedication to service and wealth of local knowledge has seen him recognised as one of the most valued group captains, having been awarded the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Long Service Medal, the clasp for 50 years service; the National Medal, first and second clasps; and the Premier's Bushfire Emergency Citation. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Right around Australia people are dealing with sharp cost-of-living pressures, and for those on low and fixed incomes, for pensioners and single parents and young people earning the minimum wage, those pressures really hurt; they present tough choices and tough realities. But Australians facing those pressures don't want to be told stories; they expect their government to face up to the challenge and to respond. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has responded to stagnant wages by increasing the minimum wage and moving to fix a broken bargaining system. We've acted to address the cost of essential medicines by delivering the largest reduction in the maximum price under the PBS in its 75-year history. We've put a cap on gas prices, which is already having an effect, and we're reforming our energy system to deliver cheaper reliable energy into the future. And we're delivering childcare support for more than one million Australian families. That is what good government looks like—no excuses, no turning away from tough problems, no pretending there is a magic wand or easy answers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of inaction and incompetence and dishonesty, the Australian community needs and deserves good government—focused, measured, serious, decisive, hardworking government that is guided by the principle of fairness, that proceeds in a spirit of optimism and that believes in the possibility of positive, sustainable change. That is the Albanese Labor government. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Sir Andrew Sheppard Grimwade CBE, late of Mansfield, who passed away aged 92 on 30 January. Andrew's contributions to Australian science, arts and life are manifold and distinguished. Andrew was a chemical engineer, trained at the University of Melbourne; a scientist, trained at Oxford; a philanthropist; a businessman; and a cattle breeder. He gave over 50 years of service to the National Gallery of Victoria and 15 years as Honorary President of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He was a  founding member of the Australian government Remuneration Tribunal, an inaugural member of the Council for the Order of Australia, and a member of Australia's first trade mission to the People's Republic of China. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Andrew retired to Mansfield, he threw himself into the local community. He led the establishment of the not-for-profit Beolite retirement village, serving as chair of the board right up until last year. He organised bequests for Mansfield Autism Statewide Services and Rosehaven Hospice. He quietly contributed to the historical society, to the emergency precinct and to local campaigns against gambling and fast food. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was an extraordinary networker, a connecter of people. To me, he was a learned guide with an infectious positivity for our nation. I offer my condolences to Sir Andrew's wife, Marsha; to his son, Angus; to his grandsons Lachlan and Campbell; and to his many extended family and friends. Vale, Sir Andrew Grimwade. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Last Thursday, the Deputy Prime Minister made an important statement about securing Australia's sovereignty in which he spoke about the importance of defence partnerships and sovereign capability. The previous day union leaders representing Australia's naval construction workforce briefed MPs about the risk of a capability gap that will arise if specialised workforce skills and naval fleet construction are lost. Australia has a proven track record in naval fleet construction, including in building submarines. In South Australia, naval fleet construction at the ASC site is critical to the development and sustainment of specialist engineering design and trade skills, which can take years to develop. Naval construction will be critical to Australian manufacturing capability, particularly since the last coalition government triggered the demise of GMH and ultimately Australia's car makers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Naval construction work is vital to the South Australian economy. South Australia has the facilities, the industry expertise, the skills and the track record of significantly contributing to Australia's military defence and national security. I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister's statement, I thank him for his answer to my defence procurement question last Monday, and I look forward to South Australia continuing to play a leading role in naval construction and securing our nation's future. </span>

We are at the eve of Sydney WorldPride, an incredible opportunity to champion our rainbow communities. WorldPride is a major international event, with Sydney winning the bid to host the festival and human rights conference in 2023. In Warringah we value kindness and genuine celebration of our diversity. We had one of the highest yes votes for marriage equality in the country, at 75 per cent. Whilst there is much to celebrate, it's important that we reflect on and remember those who have been or continue to be impacted by hatred and discrimination. There is still so much work to do.</span>

Fusion Pride is an exciting new anchor of queer social connection, education, advocacy and support. It was so moving to see the joy and celebration in the room that night. I'm deeply proud of local organisations in Warringah that take leading roles in championing respect, visibility and inclusion. My Sydney Independent colleagues and I are so excited to again walk alongside queer members of our communities at this year's Mardi Gras parade. As we kick off celebrations, I truly hope every queer and gender-diverse person knows: no matter who you are or who you love, you are valid. There is a place for you in Warringah and Australia. Happy WorldPride. We see you. We hear you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I have some very exciting news to share with the House today about someone who is much loved by all of us here in the parliament: Brigette Bull, better known as Brigette from Aussies. There was an exciting buzz at Aussies when I went there this morning. Upon my arrival, Senator Tim Ayres and the member for McEwen were announcing exciting news. Yesterday Brigette's partner, Anthony Wren, proposed to Brigette while they were FaceTiming with her parents, Chris and Kate Bull, who are in New Zealand. They were having a nice cross-Tasman chat on a Sunday afternoon when he presented the ring to Brigette and asked her to marry him. I know just how much Brigette has missed her family in New Zealand, particularly over the past few years with COVID disrupting so many travel plans and family reunions. It is obvious that her now fiance recognised the importance of having her parents online for this very special moment. Brigette has been proudly showing off her stunning engagement ring today. Great job, Anthony. Since Anthony has come into Brigette's life, she has started a little later at Aussies. I know the chief whip and I both miss seeing her smiling face first thing each morning. Jo and I are very early risers. Huge congratulations to Brigette and Anthony, and our very best wishes to their parents, Chris and Kate Bull and Wendy Chose, as they celebrate this news and the happy couple begin to plan their wedding. I just hope it doesn't interfere in Brigette giving the member for Macnamara a ribbing about his almond lattes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  During last week's question time I asked the Minister for Social Services a question regarding Labor's decision to scrap the cashless debit card in the East Kimberley and how it was leading to poorer outcomes in some of our country's most vulnerable communities. The Labor government has scrapped the CDC without putting in further support for these very vulnerable communities. Instead of taking responsibility and admitting that Labor had got it wrong, the minister's response was quite unbelievable. The minister said that the antisocial behaviour in Kununurra, often fuelled by alcohol, was due to flood affected displaced people from Fitzroy Crossing now living in Kununurra. The minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I do understand that, as a result of and connected to the disruption and dislocation of many people across the region … there has been a rise in antisocial behaviour in Broome, Derby and Kununurra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So not only are the people in Fitzroy Valley coping with the upheaval of their lives due to floods—many have lost their homes and have nothing more than the clothes on their backs—but they are now being accused by this out-of-touch minister of being responsible for the bad behaviour of some welfare recipients in Kununurra. This was a distasteful show of ignorance. It's insulting to the people of the Fitzroy Valley and demonstrates just how out of touch this minister is. The minister owes the people of the Fitzroy Valley an apology. This is a matter of urgency, and she should come in here and deliver that apology now.</span>

All over this country today, students are learning more than just the lessons from their teachers; they are learning a way of being in this world. Every time I'm called upon to perform an official role at a school in Hasluck, be it presenting an award or presenting a flag, I'm given an opportunity to catch a glimpse of the efforts and achievements not just of students but of the wonderful people who dedicate their lives to guiding young people to live their potential.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within my own family, I see young people guided and encouraged in their creativity and their musical skills. I see their deep sense of values and their social conscience nurtured by good role models. I see children able to adapt to change and unfamiliar cultures because they've been encouraged to embrace the new and different and to push at boundaries. I see passions and dreams realised, whether it's a love for science, for dance, for therapy or for business. I see a student supported to go on to become a Doctor of Chemistry, the first PhD in the family. Great teachers have been there at every turn, and, from my family, I thank you. In January this year Education Minister Clare stated that he wanted us to acknowledge the tremendous effort and work of teachers more formally and more often. I add my voice to his.</span>

It's called <span style="font-style:italic;">Just </span><span style="font-style:italic;">like you, only a little more different</span>, and it was written by Brook Seal, a farmer from Kimba, about his son, Ziggy. Ziggy had a cardiac arrest two days after birth and is suffering severe brain injury. Communication and movement are difficult for him. But he now attends Kimba Area School and is in year 2. Brook wrote a book so Ziggy's class could better understand what he was thinking and where he came from, because he can't communicate with them. I have a quote here from the book, just to give you a bit of a feeling of the flavour: 'Just like you, I like to play. I love playing outdoors. I love listening to music. I love going to kindy to be with all my friends. I love playing with the wool from our sheep on our farm.' That's Ziggy. The book has already sold over a thousand copies, and, in a typically generous move from Brook, all profits go to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Brook says that, while he wrote Ziggy's story for his classmates, there is a message in it for all of us about accepting differences. It might be about someone's religion or sexuality—anything. It doesn't matter who you are if you are different. You can buy it from Booktopia, Amazon or booko for $27, or just go on Facebook and put in '<span style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ust like you, only a little more different</span>'. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Tulliallan is the largest primary school in my electorate and the second-largest primary school in Victoria. I was honoured to address the students and speak to them about the importance of leadership roles within their school. These students will learn the traits of leadership, responsibility, humility and duty, which will serve them well into the future. This school serves as a sample of the community I represent. As I looked out to the students and their proud parents behind them, I saw many different faces looking back at me. They all learn together, play together and grow together as one united and diverse community. Nothing makes me more proud than seeing successful examples of Australian multiculturalism right before my eyes. I thank the principal, Kathryn Sharp, for inviting me and the school staff for educating the youngest residents of Holt.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  One of my constituents, Ron, wrote to me this morning: 'I just received advice from my electricity supplier, EnergyAustralia. From 1 March my energy bill will rise by an additional $361.51.' The members opposite might not want to listen to Ron about his electricity price going up, even though those opposite said, on 90 occasions, that electricity bills would come down by $275. Those opposite might think they're better than Ron, who, like many pensioners, is fighting rising electricity bills—which just goes to show that the priorities of those opposite are not the priorities of the Australian people. Inflation is eating a giant hole in the budgets of Australian families, and yet the Labor government wants to hide under the covers, and all that those pathetic morsels of government members can do is sit there and hurl abuse. We have a Prime Minister who is hands-off. We have a Treasurer who spent the summer penning 6,000 words of complete drivel and more concerned with what goes on a $5 bill than the spending capacity of Australians who don't have those five dollars. The cost of living is the No. 1 issue facing Australians right now. Australians are crying out for their government to help them with the impacts of inflation, rising interest rates and rising energy prices. Ron is asking what's to be done about increasing energy prices, and all we have from those opposite is crickets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  With the permission of her family, I rise to pay my respects to Aunty Buster Turner. Aunty Buster was born Maude Charmaine in 1955 to Kaurna parents who had been removed from their land and sent to the Point Pearce Mission. When she was two years old she contracted whooping cough and was sent to the Adelaide children's hospital. She was immediately fostered out. Her mother and grandmother sat at the hospital for four days before they were told she was gone. They never recovered. She was fostered to a non-Indigenous family living on Kaurna land—so she was brought up on Kaurna land but without connection to her family and community. Her foster family gave her the nickname 'Buster', as she had a habit of busting things as a small child and not being able to fix them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aunty Buster's oldest son, Corey, and his family now run the Living Kaurna Cultural Centre in Boothby. When I visited there with the now Minister for Indigenous Australians in 2022, Aunty Buster proudly showed us around. She showed us the scar tree and the oven mounds for megafauna.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aunty Buster attended the National Apology to the Stolen Generations by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 15 years ago. Corey tells me it was a very special moment for her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aunty Buster died on 12 October 2022. Her favourite song, 'The Rose', was played at her funeral. She is survived by her partner, Greg; her children Corey, Waiatia and Ben; and her grandchildren Tamequa, Isaiah, Tobias, Nasyah, Aaleya, Khalan, Jai, Ayva, Maci, Braxton, Koah and Ariah.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise to update the House on the exciting progress of two really important intersection projects in my electorate—those at Cross Road and Fullarton Road, and at Fullarton Road and Glen Osmond Road. Both were funded by the previous government as part of our congestion-busting initiatives. I'm excited to say that both are very close to completion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cross Road-Fullarton Road project is now well through the major realignment surface works. I appreciate all the patient residents who have had to deal with some of the restrictions on that intersections over the last couple of weeks. It's for an important long-term benefit, and I know everyone in that corner of my electorate understands that and is excited about that coming to fruition in the coming weeks. It's been a long and important project that we've spent nearly 2½ years on, from the announcement of that funding in the 2019 budget to the significant consultation process. I'm very excited that we're close to that being completed and, equally, just down the road, to the Glen Osmond Road-Fullarton Road intersection upgrade being completed. That's a little further behind Cross Road-Fullarton Road, but it's coming along and surface works are progressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to see a transformation of the traffic-carrying capability of Fullarton Road. It will benefit people well beyond my electorate of Sturt. I'm very proud of that investment and that legacy of our government in busting congestion in the eastern suburbs.</span>

This will affect people who have lived under a shadow of uncertainty for too long and unnecessarily. The lives of 19,000 people already living in our community will change for the better. These people deserve the opportunity to participate in all aspects of Australian life and the Australian economy—and now they will. They can gain secure employment, grow businesses, more easily study, sponsor eligible family members to Australia and benefit from a pathway to Australian citizenship. This makes our community, our economy and our nation stronger.</span>

The article went on to say that 'drinking on the foreshore has escalated, and tourists were being driven away by people fighting, yelling and aggressively asking for money and cigarettes,' and that locals were being exposed to 'defecating in the streets around the business areas and on the lawns on the seafront, fighting in the streets, smashing bottles' and general antisocial behaviour.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, Australia will be presented with a choice, a unifying opportunity on the path to a reconciled nation. Australians of all walks of life will be asked whether they support First Nations recognition in our Constitution, acknowledging our Indigenous brothers and sisters as the original custodians of the land and culture that has continued to exist for over 60,000 years. Australians will also be asked to establish a voice to parliament, a body to provide advice to government on areas and policy that will affect First Nations communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  The annual Prime Minister's XI versus the Press Gallery cricket fixture for 2023 was played again on Sunday afternoon, the contest in which we of course play for the Peter Veness Memorial Cup. It will not come as any surprise to this place, but it is my obligation, in any event, to confirm that the politicians were again victorious. Special mention to Jake Hauritz, from the gallery, who retired on 52 after a well-constructed innings, and to Joe Dawes, who we understand took the first ever hat-trick to take place in this contest, which of course is the longest-running fixture of any of the sporting contest to take place between members of parliament and the fourth estate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am disappointed that the captain of the Press XI, Andrew 'the pot plant' Probyn, is not present with us in the chamber right here. But I am led to believe that he is nursing a bruised ego after his solitary over went for a punishing 15 runs—which, I have to say, turned the game distinctively in favour of the politicians, who were able to chase down the press's 157 comfortably with two overs to spare. It was a great game that was played in the best of spirits but, importantly, that concluded the right way.</span>

It is the stench of hypocrisy—to have the audacity to come into this place and lecture us on how we are not delivering on cost-of-living relief measures. The member for Fadden conveniently forgets to remember that it was the member for Hume that was hiding under the sheets. It was the member for Hume who failed to tell people in this place and the people of Australia about the impending increases to the cost of energy.</span>

I refer to the government's decision to abolish temporary protection visas. When Prime Minister Kevin Rudd took a similar decision in 2008 the result was more than 800 boats and 1,200 deaths at sea. Has the government received any warnings from agencies, officials, experts or foreign governments that this decision could lead to an increase in people-smuggling arrivals?</span>

                  </a>  I make the point on temporary protection visas and those impacted by this decision of the government that we went to an election and made it clear before the election. We have informed governments, and the Leader of the Opposition would be aware because I informed him. The Indonesian defence and foreign ministers, for example, were here last week. We have made very clear what our intentions are. </span>

                  </a>  We've continued to operate on that basis. What we have done though is not left in limbo people who have been in Australia for a decade or more. This applies only to people from 2013 or before. In terms of those people, during the nine years in which those opposite were in office, not one of those people were sent back—not one—to Afghanistan or Iran. If they're arguing that they should be sent back and that if only they had got a fourth term they would have acted and sent them back, then they should stand up and argue that that's the case.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  Thanks to the member for her question but also for the time we spent at the Ashburton, Ashwood and Chadstone Public Tenants Group at the hub there at the Beresford Park Reserve in Chaddy. I also know now, from talking to the minister for infrastructure, that she worked at the Priceline at Chaddy when she was going through university, but thank you to the member for her question. The member understands, as does this government, that the big pressure on Australians right now is cost-of-living pressure. The big challenge in our economy is inflation and that is what makes it the biggest focus of the Albanese Labor government. Our plan to address the inflation challenge has three parts to it. It is about relief, it's about repair and it's about restraint. It is about: cost-of-living relief when it is responsible to do that; repairing the broken supply chains that made inflation worse; and showing spending restraint in the budget as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key feature of the May budget will be direct energy bill relief for struggling households and small businesses. Some welcome news over the weekend and on Friday was more evidence from the energy market and from the Reserve Bank that our energy plan is taking the pressure off inflation by taking some of the sting out of these high energy prices. The Reserve Bank statement on Friday also reported that supply-side shocks account for at least half and as much as three-quarters of the inflation in our economy. That is why the second part of our plan, repairing broken supply chains, is so critical. It is why we are addressing labour and skills shortages with fee-free TAFE and more university places. It is why we are investing in cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy. And it is why we are bringing in the National Reconstruction Fund, to broaden and deepen our industrial base to make our economy resilient and self sufficient and to secure the high-wage, high-skilled jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not at all surprising but it is disappointing that those opposite are standing in the way of so much of our economic plan. It is especially disappointing because, having been so much of the problem over the past decade and contributing to this inflation challenge, they are now voting against the solutions. By voting against our energy plan, they are voting for even higher power prices and even higher inflation. By voting against a more resilient manufacturing sector, they are voting for even higher inflation for longer. And by voting against more affordable housing, they are voting for even higher inflation for even longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people are already paying a hefty enough price for the wasted decade of missed opportunities and messed up economic priorities of those opposite. Our job on this side of the House is to engage in the right and responsible economic plan, which is all about relief and repair and restraint in the budget. That is our job and we will continue to do it.</span>

Can the Prime Minister guarantee that he's not received any advice that the government's watering down of Operation Sovereign Borders is likely to result in more people-smuggled arrivals?</span>

We took it to the election, and I haven't seen a need to swear myself into other portfolios. Because when you lead your party to an election and win, as we did last May, you implement the policies that you put in place, and you don't run around and undermine your ministers, like your leader did to you when you were the minister. I can also guarantee that we won't be sending out shonky text messages on the day of the next election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUSIC:</span>
                  </a>  the huge job impact and boost that comes from that: secure, long-term, strong jobs that come out of manufacturing. There couldn't be an even greater point in time where we need to see this happen—where we need to rebuild manufacturing capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer indicated to the House the contribution of supply-side shocks to inflation. It happened under the watch of those on the other side. They didn't do anything concrete about it. And, at the point that we want to do something about it, through our National Reconstruction Fund, what's the first thing they say? 'No'—no to jobs; no to opportunity; no to growth; no to, in particular, people in the regions being able to have a chance to be involved. We said we would introduce a national reconstruction fund. We said it was important. We're getting on with the job of doing just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia should be a country that makes things. It should be able to create jobs in our regions and our outer suburbs, and particularly to ensure that Australians in those parts of our country will benefit from sustainable economic growth and have access to those jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, we want to create jobs in Aston, in Braddon, in Lindsay, in Casey, in Wide Bay—all the places where those opposite are denying us the chance and saying, 'We should not have a fund that helps support regional manufacturers.' They're prepared to dress in the high-vis; they're never prepared to back it—they're never ever prepared to back manufacturing workers and their businesses. They're content to do what they always do, which is to say no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a country where we have hope, and we have belief as to firms that need access to that capital and want to be able to grow. We want to make sure that those firms never feel like they have to leave our shores to get support. We know that they deserve to get support. Mining science technology; food processing; transport manufacturing; medical devices and vaccines; renewables and low-emissions technology; defence—all these are areas where we see that activity that contributes to longer-term economic growth, deals with our supply side challenges and creates jobs. That's all very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, on this side, we're about 'made in Australia'; on that side, 'made overseas'—that's what they're all about. We're about building capability. They're about making sure we're continually dependent on overseas supply chains. We know we can do better, and we will. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today, 19,000 refugees received the wonderful news that they would be granted permanent protection in Australia. However, a further 12,000 were not covered by this announcement. Some, instead, were covered by a failed fast-track program. These people have lived here for a decade, they're contributing to our society and they are some of the most vulnerable in our community, including women from Afghanistan and Iran. What is their pathway to permanent protection?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make a couple of points in response to her question, though. Firstly, as the Prime Minister has made very clear, what we have announced today is a statement that gives effect to a longstanding commitment. It's a commitment for which the Albanese Labor government has a clear mandate from the Australian people to recognise this group of people. As members opposite well know, this is a group of people who arrived before Operation Sovereign Borders. They should perhaps reflect that in some of their commentary if they are to act responsibly in our national interest, and our shared interest, in ensuring that our border remains secure. I say that to members opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What our announcement does is contemplate the circumstances of all people in this cohort. It does that. I will be briefing the member for Wentworth and other members of the crossbench on the details of this announcement later today. But let me say this: we contemplated the circumstances of all of these people, including a large number who 10 years on are yet to have a primary decision in a manner that is consistent with due process. But it fundamentally comes back to this: we believe that people who are ultimately found to have been owed protection should be able to access this pathway.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday night, I attended, with Minister Husic and with the trade minister, Don Farrell, the food and beverage manufacturing council annual function. It was held in Sydney. One of the things that occurred all night was a queue of people to just ask: Why is this controversial? Why is it that the idea of establishing a National Reconstruction Fund of $15 billion to support Australian industry and to support Australian jobs across the food and agricultural sector, across defence, across renewables, across critical minerals and across all of these areas is the subject of division in this place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a bit beyond me, because one of the lessons of the pandemic is that we need to be more self-reliant. We need to be more resilient. We are vulnerable when we don't have what we need here or don't have the capacity to stand on our own and make things here. That's why we went to the election committed to the National Reconstruction Fund. It's been supported by all of those industry bodies and by the peak business organisations. It's a simple principle. Australia has benefited over the years, and will continue to do so, from sending our resources overseas. We have an abundance of them. That gives us revenue. But, where possible, isn't it smarter to value-add here, to create jobs here, to build capacity here and to get that income and greater economic return for the products that we have?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in a range of areas, including everything that goes into a battery—nickel, lithium and copper—we have things in abundance here. We have some of the most abundant supplies in the world. That's why the NRF has such broad support. An independent board will have oversight, just like with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and it will produce a return to government. So it's also good economics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But those opposite are opposing it. They say no to secure jobs, no to Australian manufacturing, no to new industries and no to a future made here. It's negativity and obstruction just for the sake of it. Well, businesses big and small all support this. On Saturday night, they asked me to send a message to this parliament, and I committed to do so. They said you should get on board, get out of the way and support the National Reconstruction Fund legislation that's before this parliament and support manufacturing here. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The IMF has expressly warned against Labor's $45 billion in off-budget spending because it will lead to higher inflation, which of course pushes interest rates up. Given the typical Australian mortgage has already increased by $1,400 a month under Labor, why is the Prime Minister ignoring the experts and implementing policies that will push these costs up even higher? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?</span>

                  </a>  Now, the National Reconstruction Fund and what it will do to benefit the economy: if you have a product like that I spoke about before, lithium, you can put it on a ship, export it off, wait for it to be made into a product—a battery, or everything that goes into a solar panel is also, of course, produced here. We can import it back, and take solar panels as a good example. Currently, over 85 per cent of the world's solar panels are produced in one country. If things continue to project, that figure will rise to over 95 per cent in a decade. If you think about the role that renewables play and how vulnerable that makes the world to supply chains, it makes absolute economic sense for us to, where possible, make products like that here. It's a matter not just of creating jobs here and it's a matter not just of creating higher economic growth here; it's also a matter of our national security and our resilience, our capacity to stand up for ourselves. And that's why we support the National Reconstruction Fund, with $15 billion in it. </span>

Both of those policies were announced in budget reply speeches at a time when opposition leaders used to come out with policy. Both of those were announced, both of those were taken to an election, and both of those we got a mandate for. That will produce an increased supply of housing.

The opposition's opposition to the National Reconstruction Fund makes completely plain that the coalition is opposed to Australian manufacturing and that they have an utter indifference to Australia being a country which makes things. But making things matters, particularly when it comes to national security. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to Australia developing the capacity right here to build the next generation of nuclear powered submarines in Adelaide. But what that will require initially is, over the next five years, an additional 2,000 skilled workers being trained, and this is a massive challenge. But, once again, the country has been held back by the lost decade of those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition looked at this challenge, their response was to establish the Naval Shipbuilding College. This was an initiative which cost $114 million and it resulted in precisely 203 jobs being placed. There are lots of ways in which you can look at that number. That's more than half a million dollars per placement. Over a five-year period, that's about 40 jobs a year—or, looked at another way, given they had six or, really, seven different defence ministers, it's about 29 placements for each of them. Whichever way you look at it, it is woefully inadequate, because we need to train 2,000 workers over the next five years. Over the last five years, they trained just 200. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another example of the yawning gap between their announcement and their delivery—highly productive, when it came to fanfare; completely hopeless when it came to outcome. It's all about the half-time entertainment, never about the game. Everyone should be completely aware that the legacy of those opposite, when it comes to defence, is 28 different defence programs running a total of 97 years over time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, the Albanese government established a task force with the South Australian government so that we can have complete alignment, between both tiers of government, about the training investments required to generate the skilled workers that we will need for the future—because on this side of the House we understand one of the great things about manufacturing is the high-skilled, high-paid jobs that it generates and we also understand that the thousands of future naval shipbuilders will be, for this country, a great strategic national asset. </span>

In May last year, in response to a single rate rise, the Prime Minister said Australians were facing a full-blown cost-of-living crisis. Given that the RBA has lifted rates eight times since May, will the Prime Minister now accept responsibility for a cost-of-living crisis on his watch? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? </span>

I agree with the bloke who said, 'It's very clear the world has changed dramatically, even in the past few months. We've seen a rapid shift to an inflationary environment. Interest rates are bucking decades of downward trends.' He said that in September. I agree with my predecessor. He said, 'There's not a lot we can do about things that are happening overseas that are impacting on our economy.' And his leader currently said, 'Nobody wants to see interest rates go up but it's the reality of a world where there's inflation. I think Australians understand that. There's a lot of pressure, upward pressure, on interest rates at the moment.' That happened when interest rates started to go up, which was on their watch. </span>

He knows that there is no city bigger or more important to Australia's manufacturing food bowl than Melbourne and its suburbs. He also knows that the National Reconstruction Fund will be key to ensuring that the world's climate emergency is Australia's jobs opportunity. That's perhaps why the creation of the National Reconstruction Fund has been supported by the Energy Efficiency Council, the Smart Energy Council, the Electric Vehicle Council and Origin Energy, who have all explicitly supported the policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member also asked me how the National Reconstruction Fund will build on other agencies and policies. There is no more important example than the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which has been so important in Australia's development of renewable energy industries and is now the world's most successful and largest green bank. That's very important. It is also important because, as the minister for industry has pointed out, he has based the design of the National Reconstruction Fund on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is very important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also relevant because the same arguments that are being used by the only groups to oppose the National Reconstruction Fund—which is the Liberal and National parties—were the arguments they used to oppose the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 10 years ago. They're exactly the same records on repeat. If you look at what they said at the time, the member for Bradfield said 10 years ago in this House—</span>

I will concede it was a tightly drafted question: 'How is this program helping Australia's status as a renewable energy superpower, how has it been received and how does it build on existing achievements?'

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what he said 10 years ago. He's nodding! They say the same thing today. So devoid of imagination are they that they say the same thing today about the National Reconstruction Fund.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CFC has invested $11.7 billion in projects worth $42 billion. Every dollar the CFC has invested has leveraged $2.6 of private sector investment. It has created thousands of jobs, produced 5.2 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity and reduced emissions by 240 million tonnes. But apart from that it has been an utter and complete disaster! The member for Bradfield had a point! This is what you get when you have an opposition so devoid of their own ideas, so devoid of a constructive approach and so devoid of acting in the national interest that they just oppose. They opposed it 10 years ago. They tried for years to abolish it and they failed. Now they are trying to stop the next phase, the National Reconstruction Fund. This is what you get when you have a Leader of the Opposition who is all opposition and no leader.</span>

He knows that across our country the dream of a secure home has become so much harder. It's become harder for Australians to buy a home, harder for Australians to rent a home and, indeed, harder for people to find somewhere safe and secure to call home.

And, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, 4,000 of those homes will be for women and children fleeing family violence, and for older women at risk of homelessness. It will also provide $200 million for improvements to housing in remote Indigenous communities, and $100 million for crisis and transitional accommodation for older women, and for women and children leaving family and domestic violence. It will also include $30 million to build housing and fund specialist services for veterans who are experiencing homelessness.</span>

Most Australians would expect people in this place to support more social and affordable housing, but, from what we're hearing, that is not the case. Indeed, we're hearing that some will be coming in here to vote no to building more homes for women and children fleeing family violence. People will be coming in here and voting no to building more homes for veterans that are homeless. They will be coming into this place and voting no to people in need today right across the country—people in our cities and in our regional towns. Australians are already paying the price for almost a decade of little action from those opposite on housing. These Australians cannot afford for us to waste another day.</span>

People in my electorate of Brisbane are struggling to see a doctor as the number of bulk-billing GPs in my community plummets. Treasurer, will you scrap the $250 billion stage 3 tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, including politicians and pretty much everyone in this room, and assist people with real cost-of-living relief, such as boosting GP bulk-billing payments and bringing dental into Medicare?</span>

That's why a central part of our three-point plan to address inflation is relief, cost-of-living relief, for people doing it tough, whether it be their energy bills, whether it be their medicines, whether it be early childhood education, whether it be fee-free TAFE, whether it gets wages moving again. These are all essential parts of the government's work to try and put downward pressure on inflation because it's very difficult for people, in the economy right now, when we've got these cost-of-living pressures coming at us from around the world but being felt around the kitchen table.</span>

Earlier this month, I went to the remote Western Australian town of Fitzroy Crossing, accompanied by the member for Durack, to meet with members of the local community recovering from the devastating floods caused by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Ellie. The damage that has been done to crucial infrastructure and homes in the region is very significant. The floods devastated families, disrupted businesses and supply chains and has sorely tested community resilience. We have all seen those terrible images of a very broken bridge that once crossed Fitzroy River.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this government acted very quickly through the Minister for Transport, Catherine King, to change heavy vehicle access for road trains to ensure the freight of food and essential supplies kept moving to north Western Australia. I want to acknowledge and thank Senator Glenn Sterle; there is no greater advocate, in this whole building of advocacy, for trucks and truckies and the freight industry as a whole. What we do know is that essential supplies to Fitzroy Crossing and the Kimberley require a detour of 7,400 kilometres. It's an extraordinary detour, and that's why it's important we make sure the road trains are as big as they safely can be and carry as much as they can, delivered by Aussie truckies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government continues to work closely with the WA government to support the ongoing recovery. I want to acknowledge the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, and his team for all they are doing to help those in Fitzroy Crossing and other affected areas like Derby and Broome.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commonwealth support is available for those in natural disaster impacted communities through the $1,000 Australian government disaster recovery payment and income subsidies through the disaster recovery allowance. National Emergency Management Agency officers have been deployed to Western Australia to work with the WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services and with the local council in Derby-West Kimberley. Further, NEMA personnel have been on the ground in Fitzroy Crossing, assessing the damage with the local communities and also with DFES and WA Main Roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NEMA is working very closely with the National Indigenous Australians Agency to identify recovery needs at the community level. We know that traditional owners need to be part of the conversation on how we support those communities to recover and rebuild with resilience in ways that are culturally appropriate and of course needs based. Services Australia have deployed extra staff to that remote region as well, and they have served admirably as they had to relocate to a new office when their office was significantly damaged. I want to thank the local services manager, Zara, who the member for Durack and I visited, and her whole team for all of the work they are doing with the community to ensure people are well supported through this disaster. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hundreds of defence personnel and reservists who sacrificed their summer breaks to support their fellow Australians when they needed it most. There is still flooding throughout northern, western and Central Queensland, with some local resupply disruptions continuing. Flooding is forecast to continue to impact the Darling River communities in coming weeks as water continues to move downstream. Meanwhile, flooding has peaked and is slowly beginning to fall along the length of South Australia's River Murray. The House, of course, will be aware of the unprecedented flood damage caused by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Ellie as it continues to impact parts of the Kimberley region of Western Australia.</span>

In just the last five weeks, up to 275 ADF full-time and reservist personnel at a time worked hand in hand with the Western Australian departments of fire and emergency services and of communities to ensure that people from remote and regional communities were relocated from floodwaters, helping more than 1,200 people.</span>

I'd like to thank the Prime Minister, the Minister for Emergency Management and the Minister for Northern Australia, who joined the Premier of Western Australia, the WA Minister for Emergency Services and the WA Minister for Community Services, who have all visited the flood zones. Thank you for your support for the communities of WA's north-west.

Services Australia staff are on the ground in Fitzroy Crossing and Broome to ensure people get the assistance that they need. I'd like to remind those communities in the north of WA that, under the Albanese Labor government, we don't believe that it's your postcode that should determine your access to disaster support but your need.

If you join the Australian Defence Force, you're there to protect and to defend our country. It's not their first call or first preference to be deployed on some of these operations, and we're respectful of that, but they do lend a very significant hand. They provide a lot of support to those communities, and we would work very closely with the government—there's still the outstanding issue of medal recognition for those in relation to recent deployments. We very strongly support the awarding of that medal. It would send a very clear message to them and to their families for the sacrifice that they've made in our country's name. We would be very willing to entertain those discussions with the government.</span>

The stacking of Commonwealth government boards and entities with party-friendly appointments has become all too common and undermines the very foundations of our democracy. The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2023 proposes the establishment of a board that will oversee the disbursement of $15 billion, but the relevant ministers are set to appoint all of the board members themselves. How can the minister assure the Australian people that this board will be truly independent of government?</span>

I appreciate not only the question but, if I may say so, the constructive way in which the entire crossbench has worked with us on this. We think this is a moment for nation building. The National Reconstruction Fund is a significant investment in capability, and we want people to feel like they've got a part to play in setting this up for the longer term, because it will be important for the economy and for communities well into the future. So it is important to be able to take those factors into account. We're not going to agree on everything, obviously, but people expect that the parliament will work collaboratively, which is exactly what is happening from there—not from here but certainly from there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I may say so to the member for Mackellar, there were two big motivations for setting the fund up. One was obviously to attend to those supply chain issues and to learn the lessons from the pandemic—not to say, 'We've picked those lessons up,' and then do nothing afterwards but rather to rebuild capability in those priority areas. The second thing was that we saw in the last term of parliament huge amounts of money being allocated not in the national interest but in a political interest. You saw the grants. You saw the rorts. We were all shocked by that, and we wanted to do better. So this is why we—particularly the Prime Minister when this was announced in March last year—emphasised the independence of the board: these decisions would be made in a way that would be independent of political decision-making, and you'd have people of capability making the decisions. If I can go to the heart of your question, we want to make sure that all the investment decisions of the NRF will be made solely by the board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the composition that you referred to, the legislation has listed skills that the two responsible ministers—I and the Minister for Finance—have to have regard to in making the appointments: experience in things like banking and finance, venture capital, private equity, economics and industry policy—that industrial background that is really important. Just as with the successful CEFC, which was opposed by those opposite, we want to make sure that the NRF operates along those lines with decisions made in the national interest, with not a colour coded spreadsheet in sight—not the way that those opposite made decisions. We want to make sure that these decisions are made in the national interest for the longer-term benefit of the country, rebuilding manufacturing and creating jobs, unlike those opposite, who said no to jobs, no to manufacturing and no to regional opportunity. They love dressing in the high-vis, but they never back the workers who actually wear it. They are never there. All those people who profess to support manufacturing will need to account for their failure to support it properly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  I thank the member for his question. With almost 10,000 people over the age of 65 in his electorate, I know that lifting the standard of aged care is a priority for him, and I thank him for his advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to the delivery of safe and high-quality aged care. No older person should have to experience substandard aged care. But you can't improve what you can't measure, and that is why we are shining a light on aged-care services that are not meeting standards or community expectations. Australians have the right to know, and that is why in December the Albanese government delivered a key recommendation of the royal commission when we delivered star ratings so that older people and their families have greater information and greater choice. Star ratings provide a nationally consistent benchmark to monitor, compare and improve residential aged-care services, and we are working with providers to improve their ratings. The fact that almost one in 10 residential aged-care homes have either a one- or two-star rating shows that, after nine years of neglect, there is a lot of work for us to do to reform aged care, on a number of fronts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, as we know, did not want the problems in aged care highlighted when they were in charge. But I was surprised to find out that, on the day that we released star ratings, they didn't want the problems in aged care highlighted, even on our watch. On the day that we delivered star ratings, the opposition called for them to be torn down. They would not know transparency if they were looking through a window—not even when it's on our watch, when we are charged with fixing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency is not a bad thing. It's not a forbidden word, as those on the other side of the House would have you believe. Transparency also lets you highlight the good work that is happening by hardworking people who are doing their utmost to lift the standard of care in aged care in this country. Since the release of star ratings, I have visited 15 aged-care homes, from the Sunshine Coast to regional Queensland to Tasmania and in my electorate of Lilley. I'm proudly the representative of two five-star homes in Lilley. I talked to the aged-care workers in each of those 15 homes about the components of the star ratings and the work that they did to achieve them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sam at Lutheran Services Salem Aged Care, a four-star facility in Toowoomba, runs the Happy Table project, which is about creating a restaurant-like experience. He works with a dietitian to make sure residents are nourished properly. Bowder Lodge Care Centre in Nambour is a five-star facility. From talking with workers and the CEO, Helen Sharpley, there, it is clear why. By requiring transparency, we showcase standards of care the sector can aspire to. I commend all these facilities for being ambitious for aged care, like we are.</span>

Why have these households still not seen any relief? Prime Minister, why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?</span>

Madeleine Masterton appeared as a witness in the royal commission with Victoria Legal Aid on 31 October last year. For the record, she is a clinical research nurse and a credentialed diabetes educator. She has attained a Master of Nursing Science degree from the University of Melbourne, a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Australia and a Graduate Certificate in Diabetes Education from Deakin University. She worked part time while attaining these degrees and intermittently received modest Centrelink payments. She is also—although it doesn't go on her CV—a victim of the previous government's unlawful robodebt scheme. She received her illegal robodebt letter in mid-2018. She eventually rang Victoria Legal Aid, who supported her in an action against the government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To stop her, on 27 March 2019 the government received the Masterton advice, exhibit 2-1731, which I hold in my hand. This advice only came to light because of the royal commission. Senate inquiries were unable to get this advice. It is another example showing that without the royal commission, which those opposite opposed, we wouldn't know what I'm about to tell you. The advice said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Applicant would have good prospects of succeeding in a claim for relief on the basis that the use of apportioned ATO PAYG data will not establish that she owed a debt under—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">the act. Magically, as happened on 76 other occasions, the government recalculated the debt down to zero when someone took them to court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Masterton case had wider-ranging implications for the scheme as a whole. The advice further notes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As will be clear from the above, our analysis suggests that there are wider legal risks involved in the Commonwealth solely using apportioned PAYG Data to determine whether a debt is owed to the Commonwealth in relation to the payment of social security dependent on a fortnightly income test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government were told unequivocally, 'You've got a problem with this scheme.' They were unequivocally told on many occasions, but in this case the Masterton advice, which the former government did not want us to see, spells it out. It spelled it out in March of 2019, 240 days before the member for Fadden, just about the last of the robodebt ministers still here, took any action on it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's remarkable about Madeleine Masterton is that she didn't want to be the subject of these issues but she does say this at the close of her statement:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The outcome of the class action … is not compensation for the meals that were skipped, school trips that were foregone, and the stress, fear and despair that some families and individuals no doubt experienced.</span>

In the Goldfields region of my electorate, there has been no flooding, so can the minister please explain why there has been a massive increase in alcohol related social harm as participants have come off the cashless debit card trial in my region?</span>

I note that these lands were never in the cashless debit card boundaries, so to suggest that somehow the influx of people from areas outside the cashless debit card site is linked to the removal of this card is disingenuous and wrong. I understand that the towns of Laverton and Kambalda have also had an increase in antisocial behaviour, which has been linked to the population influx, which of course is not unusual for this time of year, and that most of the increases were from people from areas that were never in the cashless debit card boundaries.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr O'CONNOR:</span>
                  </a>  We were left, of course, with a massive skills deficit. Wherever you looked across the economy, whether it was the care sector, IT or traditional trades, there were skills shortages across the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For that reason, it was critical that we moved very quickly and struck agreements with all state and territory governments to deliver, for this year, 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places. And that's what we've done. We've reached agreement with all governments—something that the previous government could not do—to supply the skills to the economy that are in demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That has been, of course, an absolutely vital thing for businesses that are crying out for skills they are in need of and for workers that need the skills that are in demand so that they can have secure employment, a decent career progression and decent wages. That's why it's so important that we supply the skills that are needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Enrolment for TAFEs and VET providers is still open. I call upon those people that are interested in entering into courses for skills that are in demand to do so, providing opportunities for their employment and providing skills that businesses need. I think it would be a wonderful thing for them to consider doing. There is no doubt that it is important to get qualifications past secondary school. Nine out of every 10 jobs that are created are indeed created with these skills that are needed, and those are things gained with a post-school qualification—university degrees and VET qualifications. It's critical that people acquire the skills that are in demand so they can have decent employment, decent career progression and the like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was at Box Hill TAFE I met with a student, Thomas, who had originally entered into a university course. Academically he was very capable, but he found it was not for him. Now he has enrolled into an electrotechnology course, and he's going to be one of those people that can participate in the transformation of the energy sector. He has chosen that path, and that is going to lead to a great career in the energy sector. It will be an area in massive demand, and it will mean a great job and a great career for him.</span>

The program is called Better Access and, as the member knows, I'm sure, the previous government decided to add 10 additional sessions to the maximum rebatable session number for a two-year period in light of the COVID lockdowns in Melbourne and Sydney and regional parts of those two states. In the March budget, before the election last year, the former government decided not to extend the expiry of those additional 10 sessions beyond 31 December.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government, we kept an open mind about that. Even though the former government had made a conscious decision not to extend the additional 10 sessions, we kept an open mind about that. I indicated in response to a question from one of the crossbench members, I think the member for North Sydney, that I would be looking at the evaluation of Better Access when it came to me—an evaluation done on a 10-yearly basis by the University of Melbourne.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that evaluation said very clearly was, as the previous evaluation had said 10 years ago, that this is an effective program where it is able to be received, but it is highly inequitable. If you are living in a wealthy suburb in the inner parts of the major cities, you are far more likely to be able to access a session than if you are in the outer suburbs or particularly in regional and rural Australia. The evaluation then went on to say that the addition of the extra 10 sessions had made that inequity profoundly worse. What had happened is that all of the additional sessions had gone to the richest 40 per cent of Australians—mostly to the richest 20 per cent—and the poorest 40 per cent of Australians had seen their access to services actually go backwards. The number of new entrants to the scheme went backwards by seven per cent—that is to say, of all of the people every single member in this House would have had come into their office—</span>

The psychologists in their areas have closed their books. The evaluation said that the additional 10 sessions the former government decided not to extend before 31 December had made that problem profoundly worse—that tens and tens of thousands of people had been cut out of the system altogether, making better access actually worse. The assistant minister for mental health and I held a round table with about 80 different groups and individuals last week, and I can say this: other than the colleges of the private psychologists, no-one at that seminar said we should reintroduce those 10 extra sessions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That means 90 per cent of homes and businesses in the NBN fixed-line footprint will have access to gigabit speeds by 2025, with 660,000 of those premises being in regional Australia.</span>

We have announced the latest tranche of suburbs that will be eligible for full fibre upgrades, and that is one million additional premises right across Australia. The latest one million premises are in suburbs and towns across the states and territories, including a significant proportion, as I said, in regional areas. These upgrades have been determined based on NBN Co's analysis of a range of factors, including the likely take-up of higher-speed tiers and the cost of the upgrade. These are important in ensuring the upgrades provide a commercial return to the company. The remaining locations to be upgraded as part of this government's investment in expanding full fibre access are expected to be announced by early 2024.</span>

If many devices are used, higher speeds mean the whole family can be online at the same time.</span>

Two trucks in front of mine, the Panton Hills and Narre Warren trucks, went onto the ridge to protect Upper Beaconsfield. All crew perished in the ensuing inferno. Back at the Pakenham station, my father-in-law, Brigade Captain NN Webster, took the mayday call. He was never the same; none of us were.</span>

But until the day came, in the new dawn, when the sun would rise again over the southern hills of the Great Dividing Range to a clear, smokeless sky, we had work to do: men, women and little children to care for, fires to suppress and communities to rebuild. But, most of all, we had a lot of grieving to do, and grieve we did—arm in arm, hand in hand, teardrop by blood-filled teardrop. Here's to you, Fireman Sam, and all who travelled with you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  The government has introduced the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 with the intention that it will amend the Migration Act 1958 to establish a consistent approach across the provisions of the Migration Act as well as the Migration Regulations 1994 in relation to sentencing for offences. The coalition supports a rigid, strong approach, ensuring that visa holders who are in Australia uphold the laws of this country and pass a character test to remain here. The need for this bill follows the decision of the full Federal Court of Australia in Pearson v Minister for Home Affairs [2022] FCAFC 203. In Pearson, the Federal Court relevantly held that, in effect, an aggregate sentence—a single sentence for more than one offence—imposing a term of imprisonment does not in and of itself constitute a substantial criminal record within the meaning given by subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act, particularly 501(7)(c), even in circumstances where the sentence is to an aggregate maximum term of imprisonment of four years and three months in respect of 10 offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who come here and are in Australia need to uphold the laws of this country. It's in the Citizenship Act, it's part of the visa requirements, and people must know that they need to uphold and respect the laws of this nation. If a non-citizen breaks the trust of being allowed into Australia by being found guilty and convicted of certain serious offences—posing a risk of safety to the Australian community—then they do not pass, absolutely do not pass the character test, so they should be considered for visa refusal or cancellation. It's a great privilege to be allowed to enter Australia. It's a great privilege to be a citizen of this country. This bill clarifies the longstanding understanding of how aggregate sentences are treated in relation to the cancelling of a person's visa on said character grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the Federal Court's decision in the Pearson case there is uncertainty surrounding the ability for the minister to cancel someone's visa based on how a court imposes a particular sentence. The opposition does support this bill. We feel it does bring clarity to the situation. But in the same instance I support the member for Wannon's amendment to make sure that this bill is better, to make sure that it serves the purpose in a better way. We know that Labor does not come to this place with a good record on migration. We absolutely want to make sure that there is clarity around this bill, to make sure that it works effectively and to make sure that people who are in this country pass the character test.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023. As my colleague the member for Riverina has just canvassed, this fairly narrow piece of legislation is in response to the Federal Court full bench Pearson decision, which has—obviously without reflecting on the decision—given rise to a circumstance where people that we believed under the intention of our legislation should have been captured are not. Of course it is the right of the Federal Court to make that determination. It is our right as a legislature to, therefore, clarify the statute so that that issue of interpretation is addressed. If this bill passes this House and the parliament, it will see the intention of the principle re-clarified in legislation so that precedent through that decision no longer stands. There is retrospectivity around that as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was just becoming fairly politically aware at the time of the very iconic statement that former prime minister John Howard made during the 2001 election—'We should decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.' I remember that that became a very significant factor in the 2001 federal election. It was a very significant contributor to the result in that election, which was of course the resounding re-election of the Howard government, because the people of this country have always expected that the federal government properly controls the flow of people into our nation and that it is a decision of Australians. The government of Australia have a right to determine how people who are not citizens of this country enter this country and leave this country. When we do grant them permission to come we can of course remove that permission in certain circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously there has always been a fair degree of consensus that there is a certain character threshold that will be applied and enforced upon people who seek any form of visa to enter this country, because it is granted with the permission of this government—and it is up to our government to decide whether or not to do so. It has always been a principle that we would apply certain standards to people who seek a visa or have successfully been given a visa and that we need to have a proper regime in place so that where, firstly, they're applying for that visa and, secondly, once they have had that visa granted that application can be rejected or the visa can be retracted, disallowed or revoked if they fail that test. Clearly it makes sense for the relevant minister to be delegated that power within a certain framework that is provided legislatively. So we're dealing here with that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the coalition are a little disappointed that the opportunity has been missed to do more than just this very narrow adjustment to the legislation. In the previous parliament we had attempted to dramatically strengthen elements of the character test and strengthen the threshold, that we have put in place, that determines whether or not someone is a fit and proper person to be granted a visa to enter this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's something that is very important, because the standards that we put in place there are, firstly, to ensure the safety of the Australian community and also send a very clear message as to the types of people who are welcome to come to our nation. People who have been convicted of certain criminal offences are not welcome to come to this country, both because they pose a risk to Australian citizens and because people who engage in that sort of behaviour are not welcome to come and enjoy any time or future in this country of ours. That is, absolutely, an important requirement of our government—to put that threshold in place and back it and defend it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are opportunities to do a lot more than what is in this bill. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2021 that we introduced in the last parliament and that passed this House and didn't pass the Senate, come the calling of the election, has exactly the sorts of measures that we would like to see the government—who voted for it, when they were in opposition, in the last parliament—put into place. It's ready to go. It, literally, is written legislation that has already passed this parliament with the support of both sides, government and opposition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend my colleague the member for Wannon, who introduced his own private member's legislation today—the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2023—because the government has had almost a year since the election. It's been nine months, and there have been plenty of opportunities to put in place, reintroduce, a very straightforward piece of legislation, that the now government themselves supported in the previous parliament, to strengthen the character test that is in place for people applying for or granted visas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know full well there are many examples that have been pointed to. Former Minister Hawke, when he had carriage of this area of policy, cited many examples in this chamber and publicly as to where a higher standard needed to be put in place in the character test. We know that the ministers are certainly bound, as they should be, by the framework that is put in place in legislation, which is the very reason we're here right now dealing with this very narrow change. A court has held that the power for the minister did not apply, in the case of Pearson, with these accumulated sentences, and we are therefore making a change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It reinforces that ministers, quite properly, do have very clear boundaries in place with how they can exercise their decision-making. We know how regularly decisions of the immigration minister are appealed and how regularly they go through all the various appropriate processes, that people have access to, to query and question and seek to overturn a ministerial decision. That's why they need a more robust framework in the character test. There are some people who do not come within the current boundaries of the legislation, for a minister to make that decision, who we think should be refused a visa or have their visa revoked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are people who have been convicted of serious criminal offences, very serious areas of the Criminal Code, including sexual violence, sexual assault and a whole range of things that any reasonable person in the street would say, 'Yes, that person should not be granted a visa to come to our nation, into our country.' The reality is that, unless we change the legislation, the minister will not be able to exercise their power to prevent those people from coming into this country or to send them away from our country if they happen to already be here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Wannon's private member's bill addresses that. It is very disappointing that we have not seen the government—in this bill, here, which responds to one narrow issue relating to a Federal Court decision—take the opportunity to properly deal with a whole range of sensible reforms to the character test within the legislation. So we would wonder and we would cast aspersions as to why a piece of legislation that the now government voted for in opposition has simply lapsed. I have spoken in this chamber on so many bills that lapsed in the last parliament that the government has reintroduced and has been moving through. This is legislation from the previous parliament that the government indeed supported in opposition. So there is no reason why on something as significant as protecting the people of this country from dangerous convicted criminals who under those legislative changes would be in a position for the minister to take appropriate action on we haven't dealt with it yet. We have gotten to the point where, today, we had to take the initiative through a private member's bill process to try and put in place changes that the government themselves agreed to in the last parliament. So that is very disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, of course, going to support this bill. We look forward to its speedy passage because it does correct a decision. We would like to see the ministerial power be clarified and we want the minister to be able to take the action the minister took in the case of the Pearson matter. That had ramifications for, I think, dozens if not maybe more than 100 people that similarly had been captured in that decision as not being able to have a ministerial determination against them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also say with a great deal of disappointment that it is a shame that further important reforms to the character test that already passed this House in the last parliament have not been reintroduced and we haven't gone through the process of correcting the legislation because of a court decision or, equally, gone to the extent of making all of the various other changes. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I rise to support the government's bill, the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023, which will amend the Migration Act 1958 to respond to the recent Federal Court decision in Pearson v the Minister for Home Affairs. At the outset, this bill concerns the way in which visas can be cancelled for failure to pass the character test, particularly where a visa holder is found to have a substantial criminal record. I support a strong approach to ensure that visa holders that are in Australia uphold the laws of this country and pass a character test to remain here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we welcome those who want to come to our great country to study, work or live here permanently. However, we also expect that these visa holders are of good character, are people of integrity, decency and honour. The good character test which is currently contained in section 501 of the Migration Act has been in place in some form since 1992. It applies to all noncitizens holding or applying for an Australian visa. Part of the test is that we expect that visa holders have not committed serious criminal acts. Under this provision, if the minister or a delegate is not satisfied that a noncitizen passes the character test, they may—or, in some cases, must—cancel a visa or refuse to grant a visa to the person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cancellation of a person's visa is mandatory if they are serving a prison sentence and they have a substantial criminal record or have been convicted of sexually based offences involving a child. One of the grounds for determining that a person has a substantial criminal record for the purposes of mandatory visa cancellation is if they have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Recently, in the decision of Pearson, the Federal Court considered whether an aggregate sentence of imprisonment—that is, a single sentence for more than one offence—constituted a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. The court found that it did not. This bill seeks to amend the Migration Act to provide that, wherever reference is made to 'a sentence of imprisonment', it does not matter whether this sentence has been imposed with respect to one offence or multiple offences. This bill, therefore, is a sensible amendment to overcome some anomalies that developed out of the Pearson judgement. This bill will ensure that there is now far more clarity for the minister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the decision in Pearson, it was reported by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> on 29 December last year that up to 100 people had been released from immigration detention after the government lost the Pearson court case. It is noted that this bill will also retrospectively validate decisions affected by the Pearson decision, including validating a previous mandatory cancellation of a person's visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protection of our borders, protection of our national security, is fundamental to protecting the lives and safety of Australians; to maintaining Australian sovereignty, with our values, institutions and territories intact; and to providing for the longer term prosperity of our nation. Australia has welcomed people from all around the globe. We're the most successful multicultural nation throughout history and throughout the world. In return, we have the right to cancel or refuse the visas of those who fail the good character test. Australians expect that, in this place, we ensure that laws are made and amended where necessary to protect them, to protect our territory and our institutions and to ensure the safety of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment of the Migration Act through this bill will clarify uncertainty that has arisen around the good character test and what constitutes a 'substantial criminal record'. The passing of this bill will assist to ensure clarity around the mandatory cancellation of visas and the minister's powers and will otherwise assist to restore integrity to our immigration system. The bill confirms that aggregate sentences for criminal offences can be taken into account for all relevant purposes under the Migration Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of the reasons just mentioned, particularly protecting Australians' national security, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  I rise in support of the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill, and I'd also like to acknowledge the amendments that have been moved by the member for Wannon, as I think they are sensible and would even strengthen the provisions of the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for this bill, as outlined by other speakers—but I just want to put it on the record—follows the decision of the full Federal Court of Australia in the court case Pearson v Minister for Home Affairs. In the Pearson decision, the Federal Court held, relevantly, that in effect an aggregate sentence—that is, a single sentence for more than one offence—imposing a term of imprisonment does not in and of itself constitute a 'substantial criminal record' within the meaning given by subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act and particularly paragraph 501(7)(c), even in circumstances where the sentence is to an aggregate maximum term of imprisonment of four years and three months in respect of 10 offences. Now, that is one that was specifically mentioned. But it would have unintended consequences for aggregate sentences for, say, two or three very serious crimes, for even longer than the four years and three months mentioned in that specific decision. If a noncitizen breaks the trust involved in their being allowed in Australia, by being found guilty and convicted of certain serious offences, and poses a risk to the safety of the Australian community, then I agree that they don't pass the character test, and so they should be considered for visa refusal or cancellation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes provisions to validate past decisions and actions under the Migration Act and certain other specified laws where those decisions and actions might have otherwise been deemed invalid as a consequence of the Federal Court's decision in Pearson. This means the mandatory invalidation of cancelled visas occurred and up to 100 people who would have otherwise—historically, and with this current amendment—not met the character test at all have had their detention cancelled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned the member for Wannon's amendments. These were amendments that were being considered last year. They include designated offences that would give more strength to the arm of the minister to cancel the visas for noncitizens if they had committed a designated offence, such as violence or threat of violence; sexual assault; breaching court orders such as AVOs for the personal protection of another person; and offences that did not occur in Australia but which, if they had occurred in Australia, would have been punishable by imprisonment for life, imprisonment for a fixed term not less than two years or imprisonment for a maximum term of not less than two years. These are sensible, rational amendments, and I urge the minister to consider them in the good spirit in which they are given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 is a very important bill because we have got a strong record of getting the right character person as a permanent resident or eventually a citizen in the country. The nation must reserve the right to get the right people living here. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a>  I speak to the amendment foreshadowed in the chamber earlier by the member for Wannon. Whilst I appreciate the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has put this important bill into the House, the member for Wannon's amendment strengthens and adds clarity to the minister's bill. This is important. And I'm glad the immigration minister has arrived—that's important. I commend him for this bill, because we want to make sure that, if somebody is going to be in Australia, on whatever visa arrangement they are fortunate enough to be in this country on, then they have passed the character test that they do the right thing—they uphold and obey the laws of this country. Indeed, when somebody is applying for citizenship, they make a pledge or an oath, and in that pledge or oath they commit to upholding the laws of this nation. The laws of this nation are very important. As I say, if somebody is fortunate enough to be here, under whatever arrangement they've been able to be provided, then they must follow, strictly, the laws of this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The various parts of the member for Wannon's amendment to the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 very much apply to ensure that the wording is strengthened. Indeed, after paragraph 501(6)(a), he has sought to insert 'the person has been convicted of a designated offence' with a note to see various subsections. Each and every part of his amendment strengthens the amendment bill that has been put to the chamber by the minister for immigration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purposes of the character test, a 'designated offence' is an offence against a law in force in Australia, or a foreign country, in relation to which certain conditions are satisfied, including: violence, or a threat of violence, against a person; non-consensual conduct of a sexual nature, including, without limitation, sexual assault and the non-consensual commission of an act of indecency or sharing of an intimate image; and breaching an order made by a court or tribunal for the personal protection of another person. We heard the member for Sturt referring to this in his contribution. We cannot afford to have people who are here under a visa arrangement breaching the law, breaking the law. We cannot afford to have somebody in this nation who is here as an absolute privilege—indeed, as part of the amendment put forward: 'conspiring with others to commit an offence that is a designated offence' because of any of the situations put forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I commend what the member for Wannon has added to this bill, noting that the national security protection of our borders—and, indeed, migration per se—has not been one of Labor's strong points. You only need to read the front-page story of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> today to note that. I appreciate that, when Kevin Rudd swept to power in 2007, he came here with a suite of promises to say that he would be very much on board with the Howard-era policies. Indeed, he was not, and the Australian people soon found that out, and 820 boats came with 50,000-plus arrivals, with 8,000 children, and that was such a mess. To this day, it is still an issue for this country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Wannon's amendment strengthens and adds clarity to what the minister for immigration has put forward. I commend the amendment. I commend the member for Wannon for putting forward this sensible, practical, reasonable amendment, and I urge the House to not only consider it but add it to this bill. </span>

We are supporting the government in their efforts to make sure that the character test can continue to operate in the form that we want it to, in the bipartisan way that it always has. There was a court case just before Christmas which changed the arrangements, and we have worked on a bipartisan basis to support the government to fix the decision that was made by the court so it operates how this parliament intends it to operate. In doing that, we have also reached out to the government and said, 'Now is a real opportunity for you to take some sensible measures to also build on and further the character test.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, this is a character test of the Prime Minister and his government. Are you prepared to take the necessary decisions to keep this nation safe, to keep the Australian people safe, or will you take the option of ignoring the bipartisan approach that we're extending to give the minister greater powers to be able to take decisions to ensure that those who have committed family violence, those who have committed sexual assaults, are asked to leave this country immediately? It's a good test for the minister, because, as the member for Riverina has said, what we've seen today is a chipping away at Operation Sovereign Borders, a chipping away at keeping our borders safe and secure, a chipping away at making sure that our immigration system is one run with integrity. What we have now is an opportunity for the minister to say: 'No. Even though I stood up at an ALP conference and opposed boat turnbacks, I understand that with governing comes responsibility; with governing comes serious decision-making; with governing comes the need to act in the national interest to keep our nation safe, to make sure that anyone here on a visa who commits family violence, sexual assault or a firearm offence will be booted from this nation—they have broken the law and they will be dealt with accordingly.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to support the government in ensuring that the approach that's taken to the character test is consistent with what this parliament has always envisaged it being consistent with. But we're also, through this amendment, saying to the government: 'We think that there are some very common-sense steps that you can take also to build on the character test to give you the option—you don't have to take it up—of being able to keep our nation safer by booting people who have committed domestic violence, sexual assaults, firearm offences. It will give you more bows to be able to take the necessary steps to keep this nation safe.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I hope that you will take up this bipartisan offering. You've voted for the equivalent of this amendment before in this House. Hopefully you will do the same again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  The shadow minister has today moved amendments that were not a priority for the members opposite when they were in government. Of course, if they had been, they would have been passed when they were in power. They had, I remind the House, four years and three immigration ministers—or, I should say, at least three immigration ministers—and sent the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test) Bill 2021, where these amendments originated from, through three inquiries in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the Australian community has a reasonable expectation that noncitizens who seek to enter or remain in Australia are of good character and are law-abiding. That is the strong view of the government. Similarly, Australians expect that any noncitizens who are not of good character will be refused a visa or will have any visa they hold cancelled. The bill before the House right now, the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023, does not change the framework within which the character test operates. Instead it allows for the continued effective administration of the powers in the Migration Act by ensuring that aggregate sentences are considered sentences, thereby restoring the ability to rely on a substantial criminal record as an objective measure for the purpose of the character test. This government, through this bill, is taking urgent, commonsense action in order to keep communities safe. Today we are not here to debate the broader character framework; we're here to clarify powers in the act right now. On this basis, we will be opposing the amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have several reservations about the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023. First, I am deeply concerned about its retrospective nature. Retrospectivity is rarely an option to be used, and I am opposed to it in principle. Second, I'm concerned that the legislation, in attempting to address the decision in Pearson, denies the 100 or so individuals affected both procedural fairness and natural justice. I am aware of the community safety issues that the government speaks of. However, this legislation, in my view, is an overstep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would help protect the rights of refugees whose offences are not grave, for whom visa cancellation and detention have enormous ramifications. I'm advised that, if a refugee's visa is cancelled mandatorily, they're effectively in detention indefinitely, as they can't return to their country of origin due to persecution there, since this would be in breach of non-refoulement rules. Once someone's visa is cancelled and they're detained, it's therefore almost impossible for them to be released. In fact, it appears that the minister doesn't expect people whose visas have been refused or cancelled under section 501 of the Migration Act to even be referred to the minister's office. Therefore, the avenues for review and reconsideration are thin. Visa cancellation, whether it leads to refoulement or to indefinite detention, results in permanent separation of children and families, including refugees who have spent their formative years in Australia. As all of us know, it's not in the best interests of children to be separated from their parents and loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment applies to people who have an imprisonment sentence of two years or less. I do not seek to minimise their crimes. However, the criminal justice system has in general found that their actions are on the lower end of the spectrum of offending. I appreciate the consideration the minister has given me and other crossbenchers in this place and in the other in the face of our scrutiny of the mandatory sentencing regime. It would help this parliament greatly, I believe, if the minister could see his way clear to detailing anonymously exactly what crimes the 100 or so people affected have been convicted of and what each of the sentences was. Transparency would assist a great deal in understanding the decision-making that has led to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept the minister's advice that some of those in that group are serious offenders. My issue is that some are not. This is why the blanket nature of this bill is problematic, especially when the minister already has the power to cancel visas when required under section 501 of the Migration Act. I've seen some case studies outlining a handful of cases from the 100 affected, but the government acknowledges that they're not necessarily representative. So what about the other 90 per cent? For those released under the Pearson decision who are reoffending violently or are guilty of sex offences, I would encourage the minister to use those powers that he already has. There's also the simple fact that we have a criminal justice system designed to deal with criminal offences. If that's not working, that's a matter that goes far beyond this group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the minister's assurance that he will be available for further crossbench consultation. Alternatives to mandatory and indefinite detention need to be discussed in a reasoned way. There are international examples, including a panel decision-making process such as been established in Canada, that could be considered. That process looks in details of the circumstances, at the crimes and at appropriate and proportionate actions to follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, this bill is before us, and this amendment seeks to protect those who would receive disproportionate punishment for aggregated minor crimes under this piece of legislation, without preventing the minister from acting against serious offenders. I commend this amendment to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  In reading the purpose of this bill, the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023, I see that it is to respond to the recent Federal Court decision in Pearson v the Minister for Home Affairs. Just pausing on that for a moment and perhaps reframing it, one might say that the purpose of this bill is to retrospectively undo decisions made by the Federal Court late last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Pearson, the Federal Court relevantly held that in effect an aggregate sentence—that is, a single sentence for more than one offence—imposing a term of imprisonment does not in and of itself constitute a substantial criminal record within the meaning given by subsection 501(7) of the Migration Act. The court reasoned that mandatory cancellation should apply in only the most serious cases and that, self-evidently, an aggregate sentence may be arrived at after conviction for a series of lesser offences, none of which on their own could render a person liable to have his or her visa mandatorily cancelled. In making its decision, the court observed that aggregate sentences are often made up of a series of minor offences and that, by way of contrast, mandatory visa cancellation should be reserved for only the most serious offending. In the words of refugee Sarah Dale:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Court made a finding of proportionate balance, it was a step towards a more humane system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to undo that decision by amending how provisions of the Migration Act and regulations apply in relation to a single sentence imposed by a court, making it the same way regardless of whether the sentence is in respect of a single offence or two or more offences. The provisions as drafted mean that people with non-violent offences like traffic offences, dishonesty or petty theft are treated the same way as violent sexual offenders. It is a blunt instrument with no room for the individual circumstances or facts of the case to be taken into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, there is a case of a young refugee who arrived here in Australia from Sudan when he was 10 years old. South Sudan, as we now know it, gained independence as a sovereign state in 2011, leaving the young refugee with no evidence that he is recognised as a citizen. He attended school in Australia and suffered sustained bullying and racial abuse. He went on to develop a dependency on alcohol and got into trouble with the police. He was initially convicted on charges of affray and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Snap! In they went and scooped him up. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to 10 months. Surely there should have been another snap and he should have been released? But, no, he continued to be detained. Recently, thanks to this court ruling, he was returned to his family over Christmas following the Pearson decision, but now he is at risk of being returned to a refugee prison. This is the kind of case in which discretion exercised by the minister would result in a better outcome for this refugee. Surely, then, as that circumstance shows, the question we must ask ourselves in every single case is whether it is a case that a criminal has arrived and is on the ground in Australia or whether the system has created a criminal? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard others in this place argue that this bill is necessary to protect the public or similar, but that's just disingenuous. Ministers and their delegates still have godlike powers to cancel visas. The decision in Pearson merely limited the blunt instrument that is mandatory cancellation with application to aggregate sentences, not other applicable powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, if passed, will apply retrospectively, meaning that people who have just days or weeks prior been released by the government and reunited with their families and communities could be forcibly taken back into detention. To release and then redetain roughly 100 people, including refugees and stateless people, often some of the most vulnerable in our community who have severe mental illnesses and trauma backgrounds, potentially created by their experiences in our country, in the space of weeks is abhorrently cruel and will devastate these people and their families. My concern is for these refugees and stateless people who cannot be removed from Australia due to the non-refoulement obligations under international law and who cannot return to their countries of origin. For these people, this bill is effectively, as the member for Goldstein said, a sentence for mandatory indefinite detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's especially jarring for me—and for many in this place, I'm sure—for this bill to be reintroduced with such urgency on the very day that the minister has made an announcement about pathways to permanency for temporary protection visa holders and safe haven enterprise visa holders. Today's announcement was the overdue delivery of an election promise, including commitments from the government to tackle Australia's unacceptable practice of indefinite detention. If the bill that was reintroduced today is passed, it will see more people detained in contradiction with their basic human rights. It will see Australia continue to falter on its international obligations. I commend the amendment as moved by the member for Goldstein and support it.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023 was introduced in the Senate just last week, with less than 24 hours notice. The government says that this bill is simply clarifying the Migration Act as an urgent response to the Federal Court of Australia's recent judgement in Pearson v Minister for Home Affairs. In that case, the court found that a person who receives an aggregate sentence of 12 months or more does not have a substantial criminal record and, therefore, will not have their visa automatically cancelled. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will restore the meaning of 'sentence' in the Migration Act so that where a noncitizen offender receives an aggregate sentence of 12 months or more for multiple offences they have a substantial criminal record, fail the character test and therefore are liable for mandatory cancellation of their visa. The government argues that this will restore the intention of the character test, under the act, and remove inconsistencies where some states and territories do not have aggregate sentencing regimes. Unfortunately, though, the possible consequences of this bill reach beyond correcting inconsistencies. It is because of these consequences that I must oppose it and am here to support the member for Goldstein's amendment, if that could be agreed to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says that noncitizens who have their visas cancelled and are re-detained following the bill's passage have serious criminal histories. I agree that we must protect the community from serious offenders, but I'm concerned that this bill goes well beyond that. The court found that mandatory visa cancellation should apply in only the most serious cases and that, self-evidently, an aggregate sentence may be arrived at after a conviction of a series of lesser offences, none of which on their own could render a person liable to have his or her visa mandatorily cancelled. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would reverse that very sensible position and, instead, allow people to be deported who have committed low-level offences that do not pose a risk to the community, such as obscene language, graffiti and drunk and disorderly offences. The bill also continues to uphold an automatic visa cancellation scheme that I am concerned results in unfair and potentially harmful deportations. Refugees and people who are seeking asylum can be deported under this scheme. These people cannot return to their country of origin and are at risk of being detained indefinitely. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, which works with asylum seekers and refugees, finds that indefinite detention causes many people to completely lose hope and they ultimately request to leave Australia, even if they fear death and torture in the country they would return to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating a situation where a refugee is forced to leave Australia raises genuine concerns, questions, about whether we are breaching our international obligations to ensure that a refugee is not sent back to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened. This is why I support the member for Goldstein's amendment, which would exempt people from this bill who have been sentenced to two years or less in imprisonment and who have been found to be in need of protection, for whom we hold non-refoulement obligations, are stateless or have been granted a visa on humanitarian grounds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who have lived in Australia almost all of their lives, since they were children, can have their visas automatically cancelled under this bill. If these people are deported to their birth country, they may have no community, no family, to assist in their rehabilitation. These people include women like Kate Pearson herself, who was convicted of drug and property offences. She was born in New Zealand, but under this bill she now risks deportation after spending 20 years in Australia, leaving behind her partner and her business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ultimately oppose this bill because it is unnecessary and unjustified. Under the Migration Act, the immigration minister has discretion to cancel a visa at any time, as we've heard numerous times during this debate. If this bill did not proceed, the minister could still decide to cancel the visa of a serious offender who poses a risk to the community. That's the right of the minister. The bill deprives the immigration minister the chance to assess on a case-by-case basis if a visa cancellation is justified and warranted. The minister cannot consider whether the person has rehabilitated and would be better served remaining in Australia, and I think that's a real shame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned about the speed at which this passed through the Senate and is now before us in the House. I support the member for Goldstein, whose very sensible amendments would bring us closer to the goal of fair and humane migration law. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I note the amendment that the member for Goldstein has put forward and the significant contributions of the member for North Sydney and the member for Indi, but I let them and the House know that we won't be supporting this amendment. The Albanese government is, through the Migration Amendment (Aggregate Sentences) Bill 2023, taking a commonsense approach to this question of visa cancellation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the amendment, I draw the attention of members to the recently signed Ministerial Direction No. 99, which sets out the principles that departmental decision-makers should consider when deciding whether to refuse or to cancel a noncitizen's visa or whether to revoke a mandatory cancellation. This direction states that Australia's non-refoulement obligations, where a protection finding has been made in respect of an individual, should be considered when a decision-maker is considering refusing or cancelling a visa under section 501 or considering the revocation of a mandatory visa cancellation. Australia does not return individuals to situations where they face persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life, or the application of the death penalty. This government takes our non-refoulement obligations seriously, and so do I.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to you, Member for Goldstein, and to others who have expressed this concern to me—those from this place and the other place, and I refer particularly to Senator Pocock—I would be very happy to engage with you, separately to the issues contained in this bill, on how Australia can meet our international obligations whilst ensuring that we maintain the safety of the community at all times. However, I say again: this bill doesn't change the framework within which the character test operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I say again, as I said to the shadow minister—and I acknowledge his contribution, since I don't have the opportunity I ordinarily would have to acknowledge the contribution of all members to this debate—that what we are here today to do is to clarify the powers in the Migration Act, not to debate the visa cancellation framework more broadly, important though this debate is to everyone in this place and to the wider community. I want to make clear my willingness again to engage with all members and senators who are prepared to come together in good faith to ensure our character cancellation regime is fit for purpose. However, I am not placed to support the amendment the member for Goldstein has put forward.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  I rise to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. A few years ago, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction walked into a bar. He ordered a drink. As much as that is a joke, at its crux it was certainly no laughing matter. It turned our relatively young democracy into a laughing-stock in front of an international audience. That conduct turned our institutions of executive government into a laughing-stock to the public at large. It also showed just how close we as a country can get to being in the state of constitutional crisis when those entrusted with the highest offices in our land do not follow established practices or conventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is indeed true that the events that caused us to need to enact this legislation occurred prior to my election to this place. It certainly has allowed me to see this through the lens of how I would have reacted as a private citizen had I, along with the rest of the public, known what the member for Cook had done in the years or months prior to last year's collection. As a member of this place and of the legislative branch of government, I, along with all members of this place, shoulder a great duty and responsibility to foster public trust in this institution. But, due to the actions of the member for Cook, we do so from a position of weakness. This begins to form the basis as to why I rise today to speak in support of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not formed from an explicit election commitment, as the circumstances that brought this about only come to light publicly later, through investigations conducted by our Solicitor-General Dr Stephen Donaghue KC. The advice provided to government and subsequently made public led to another review, conducted by former High Court Justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC, into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments. As a result of these thorough investigations, the facts that brought us here are thankfully quite settled and established. They ultimately revolve around the actions of the member for Cook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cook, between 2020 and 2021, when he was Prime Minister, was secretly appointed by the Governor-General to administer multiple portfolios or departments of state. The portfolios or departments of state in question I alluded to in my opening remarks: Treasury, Finance, Home Affairs, Health, and Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. It would shock nobody to know that, at the time the appointments were made, there was no cause for the ministers that were publicly listed to be replaced with an acting minister, whether it be on health grounds or any other number of reasons that could cause a minister to temporarily relinquish their powers or to be required to stand aside from exercising their powers as a minister of state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my research on this bill, I also took note of the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I can see that this bill's passing has no financial impact. Therefore, it would have cost the government of the member for Cook zero dollars to have safeguarded responsible government, yet the member for Cook chose secrecy instead. Secrecy was definitely the modus operandi of the previous government, but you would never have speculated that that would have been the case in such a profound way to the very machinery of how the government operated. Secrecy has its own costs, some of them intangible, such as the damage caused to the reputation of Australia's government, to our democracy. Despite these events, I feel that Australia can pride itself on its democracy, one of compulsory voting and of independent electoral commissions federally and in our states and territories. In some respects it is very robust, taking pages out of the Westminster system and out of the Washington system, but I digress, and I will soon sound like a civics teacher.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the executive sits within our parliament, the legislature, is important. It means we have the ability to access executive government, to ask questions of it and to hold it to account. Exemplifying that, this place sets aside time out of every sitting day—question time. Some may refer to it as political theatre, but it is an extremely important part of our democracy, the part that is underpinned by the principle of responsible government. A member of this place can stand up during question time and ask a question of a minister of state concerning a matter involving a policy or a function of a department the minister has the powers and functions to administer. How would a member direct a question to the right minister if some of the ministerial appointments had been made in secret, secret from the parliament, from the public and even from the members of the cabinet itself? The Solicitor-General, Stephen Donaghue KC, noted in the advice he provided to the government on this matter:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is impossible for the Parliament to hold Ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which Ministers are responsible for which departments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government was elected with a mandate to restore public trust in the institutions of government and in government itself. The cornerstone of this is the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, whose legislation passed through the parliament late last year. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 follows the same core principles that underpinned the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, but there was no election commitment to enact this legislation. One might ask why that was. This legislation is a degree reactionary, as the catalyst for it was uncovered only after election day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only begin to speculate on what would have happened if the conduct of the member for Cook had entered the public domain prior to election day. I'm sure some out there would have put on a more full-blooded defence or expressed more strongly that there was nothing to see here. I wonder whether we would have had similar comments from the member for McPherson, who called the conduct of the member for Cook unacceptable and called for the member for Cook to resign and to leave the parliament. She then said she felt that the conduct of the member for Cook was a betrayal of the Australian people. You can't get much more unequivocal than that. Would we have had former prime minister Tony Abbott call the conduct of the member for Cook 'highly unorthodox' and say it shouldn't have happened?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conduct of the member for Cook also received heavy condemnation from former prime minister John Howard, although the comments were akin to: 'I don't think you should have done that.' That translates to significant criticism, when it's being levelled at its own side of politics. The member for Cook received condemnation from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull—to be fair, he's said worse about the member for Cook, both publicly and privately. He called the actions of the member for Cook 'sinister stuff', 'secret government' and 'one of the most appalling things he has ever heard in our federal government'. You could definitely tell he was holding back, which comes as a surprise to no-one. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself is rather simple in its design but, crucially, it would have prevented the situation where the member for Cook was sworn in secretly to administer several departments beyond Prime Minister and Cabinet, even without the knowledge of the ministers who served concurrently in those portfolios, meaning the member for Cook was serving as a parallel minister to a department of state—not a shadow minister but a minister in the shadows.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952. The amendments to the act would require the official secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument on the Federal Register of Legislation, which will advise of when the Governor-General has sworn in an executive counsellor to the Federal Executive Council or—in layman's terms—when a minister has been sworn in to administer a department of state, or when they have been directed to do so in whatever capacity that has been prescribed, or when an appointment of the nature I have just described has been revoked. This would appear to be largely uncontroversial on its face value, unlike the circumstances that required us to bring about codifying these conventions that have served us well for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the time between today and when the revelations about the member for Cook's multiple ministries came to light, one of the most lamentable moments has been as a result of the defence put in place to deflect or, at times, mitigate the gravity and severity of what his actions meant to our democracy, to our system of government. However, I am, going to skip over the defence proffered by the member for Cook himself in this chamber and in the media, as many parts of it are nonsense. To say that he would have revealed the truth had someone asked him is, suffice to say, a little rich for my taste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the member for Cook's words to one side, we have seen a number of arguments being made by a member of the opposition, senior or otherwise, and by a number of sympathetic members of the commentariat. The arguments being made have been relatively similar. The main argument being made in defence, perhaps at times not directly of the member for Cook himself, is that getting to the bottom of this issue is not one that everyday voters would care about, not a bread-and-butter issue. I don't know whether these are vestiges of a defeatist attitude or one that is running a beleaguered defence of the member for Cook but this needs to be something that the average voter cares about because, if it is not now, it once was. Sometimes apathy is worse than red-hot anger, for it proves a disconnect, a certain acquiesce of this sort of conduct. It breeds comments that many of us have all heard before: politicians are all the same. We shouldn't to an extent, for this very debate, be all the same. We should want the Australian voter to view us better than what they do, regardless of how they do so at any given time. To say that the trustworthiness of the holder of the office of Prime Minister is not something that is relevant to the everyday voter is either laughable or upsetting to our profession, if it were to be true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other argument being put is that the line in the sand should be drawn and, as these are matters of the past, we should all move on. It is almost as if we are talking about actions taken during ancient history, as if relics from the secret ministries scandal are now held by the British Museum. But as a jolt of reality, these actions took place within the past two years, and the truth of what took place came out for public consumption roughly half a year ago. Even in the age of the 24-hour media cycle, this is reason enough to warrant investigation, to warrant the government to seek expert advice on how to rectify how it operates to prevent this from happening ever again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the paraphrased saying goes, we are doomed to repeat history, contemporary or otherwise, if we do not learn from it. It is not a mistake I or the Albanese Labor government are willing to make. It is my hope, and I'm sure the hopes of all members present, that this bill, when passed, will help to close one of the final loops of this sorry saga, and we can move on from this as a parliament, as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I could note many contributions in this place on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 but I would like to take particular note of the brief contribution made by the member for Hume. That very succinct statement made on this bill gives me a bit of hope. It is indeed my hope that, although I did not hear full-throated support of the bill, I did hear support—a bit lukewarm, but it was supportive nevertheless. Just as with the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, the public will see a new page turned by our democratic institutions with the support of all sides of politics, particularly the two parties of government. I would encourage all members of this place to support this bill and take one further step forward to restoring public confidence in government, for, with the passage of this bill, the chapter we move on from cannot be repeated. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Our democracy is not a given. It is something that must be nurtured and maintained, and that is why I'm standing to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 today. The Albanese government is committed to our democracy, to accountability and to integrity. It is why we have established the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and it is why we are implementing the first six recommendations of the Bell inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bell inquiry was an extraordinary moment in and of itself. The fact that a former High Court justice needed to investigate a former Prime Minister swearing himself into secret portfolios without notifying his colleagues, this parliament and the Australian people beggars belief. At the time, the shadow minister for home affairs said that this behaviour was unacceptable and that she felt that the Australian people had been betrayed. I detect that not only the shadow minister for home affairs but other former ministers of the former government also felt that same betrayal. I wholeheartedly agree. Never in my political career—which also includes having come from Territory parliament into federal parliament—have I heard such blatant disrespect for our democracy, for our parliament and for the Australian people. It is why it is so important that we had the censure of the member for Cook last year. The censure sent a clear message: this type of behaviour has no place in our parliament and in our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is widely known that faith in our democracy and our system of government is under strain. I hear it all the time when I am out in my electorate. That should send shivers down the spine of every member of this place. Many people, particularly in Lingiari, believe politicians and politics in general are not working in their interests. People see politics and politicians as self-serving and as a way to protect the interests of certain individuals. This is beyond alarming, and this parliament must respond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand here today and speak on ways in which the Albanese government is strengthening integrity measures in government. This bill will implement reforms to provide greater transparency for the administration of our Commonwealth departments. It will ensure that there is clarity as to who is governing our departments of state and who is sworn in to administer departments. It will address the loopholes that the member for Cook so blatantly abused. Critically, this bill will also ensure that information on the governance of our country will be available for all Australians to find, as it should be. But, most importantly, this bill, as part of a broader suite of measures, will go some way in restoring people's sense of parliament as a trusted institution. None of us can do our jobs if our communities do not trust us, and so we must do all that we can do of what is needed to safeguard our democracy. I commend this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I wish I was pleased to rise to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, but this is a bill we should never have had to bring to this place. This is a bill that, frankly, should have been part of a policy that every single member of this place, especially those in leadership positions, should have respected in the first place, and not created the need to bring this bill into this place. We know that coming in here, in the last government, there was a constant undermining of this great institution. I'm going to run through some of the extraordinary decisions made by the former Prime Minister in appointing himself across all the really serious major policy and departments when he was the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's more than that. When we came into this place after the 2019 election, every single time we put forward different items for debate and when we sought to engage in a democratic way on topics and even on the government's own bills—like on the EPBC Act, like when they were trying to ram through industrial relations reform—we wanted to speak and participate in our democratic arena of the House of Representatives. And time after time the Leader of the House came in here and moved that members be no longer heard, and second reading questions on legislation were immediately put, on whether or not a bill should be considered, without debate. I remember the EPBC Act bill, where they tried to bring back the failed Tony Abbott environmental reforms. Without even allowing debate on the floor of the parliament, they tried to ram that through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had in the last parliament a culture of the numbers of leaders of the House they had performing in that role coming in here—there wasn't respect for this institution. There wasn't the respect to say that this and each and every member of this place deserves the right to be heard and deserves the right to represent the communities they are privileged to be here on behalf of. Frankly, it was almost as if the Prime Minister didn't want to be here, almost as if the former Prime Minister felt this place was beneath him and his roles. But it is not. You can tell the difference between the current Prime Minister—someone who has a deep sense of this place, someone who respects this place, someone who respects the institution we are all privileged to be part of—and the former Prime Minister, who, time after time, allowed debate to be shut down, moved that members be not heard, refused to engage in debate and engaged in a culture of undermining the importance of our house of democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we doing in return? This bill, the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022, will ensure that the Australian people are able to access information related to the composition of the federal Executive Council, those appointed to administer certain departments of state and the high offices that those ministers of state hold.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government, as you know, Deputy Speaker Georganas, we sought to try and rebuild trust with the Australian people. Democracy is important to us. Australian people believing in this institution is important to us. We on this side of the House wanted to rebuild a bit of trust and show the Australian people that we care about this place. This place matters. This institution needs to be protected by us as representatives of this place. We can't be coming in here with a culture of secrecy, a culture of shutting down debate and a culture of undermining and not respecting this institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given all of that, it is hardly surprising that we uncovered the former Prime Minister in the most extraordinary of circumstances, having been revealed not by him but for him, of the extraordinary power grab that he undertook in this place and as the Prime Minister of our country. We all knew that the member for Cook was the Prime Minister. It did grate a little bit, occasionally, but we all knew it—we all knew that the member for Cook was the Prime Minister. We had no idea that the member for Cook had taken carriage of five other portfolios. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when the early days of COVID arrived—and there was not only a sense of urgency but also a sense of political unity—we had discussions as a federal Labor Party caucus about our approach. The main agreement we had was that we were going to work with the government to try to support the Australian people getting through these difficult times. That meant facilitating a special sitting of parliament, where we would come into this place and pass extraordinary measures that enabled Australians to isolate safely at home, to be able to have connections to their workplace and the JobKeeper and JobSeeker policies alike. There was goodwill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were really desperate to justify the fact that the Prime Minister wanted to appoint himself as the minister for health, maybe a global pandemic is a justification for that as well, just in case—you never know what will happen, and there was a lot of uncertainty. That doesn't excuse the fact that the Prime Minister refused to tell anyone about it, that the Prime Minister didn't come into this place and say, 'Just to be clear, in case of an emergency, I have made myself as well the minister for health and, therefore, it is only as a contingency, just to ensure that there are people looking after the Australian people at all times.' I don't think that would have been necessary. I think that there are plenty of different ways in which the executive government can rearrange themselves and there are extraordinary circumstances to guide extraordinary times. But the Prime Minister didn't do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just like that culture of shutting down debate, just like that culture of trying to ram through bills without giving members a chance to speak, the Prime Minister appointed himself to two different portfolios in March 2020 and didn't tell anyone. He didn't tell the Minister for Finance, the now head of the OECD, Mathias Cormann, that on 30 March 2020 the Prime Minister took the finance portfolio for himself. It was extraordinary times in March 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We came in here working with the government in order to try and protect the Australian people and ensure that everything in this place was there to protect their interests, their livelihoods and their lives. What did the Prime Minister then do? He appointed himself the Minister for Finance but did not even tell his own finance minister. It is extraordinary that the Prime Minister had not a shred of respect for the then finance minister, not enough to say, 'By the way, mate, these are extraordinary times and I have just appointed myself, in case there is anything that you can't do, heaven forbid.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse. He then appointed himself, on 15 April 2021, as the Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, because the then minister for resources was refusing to block the PEP-11 project off the coast of New South Wales. We all know where the Labor Party has stood and the advocacy on PEP-11 has been, and I'm not here to re-prosecute that old argument. But what this shows is that the former Prime Minister understood that he could take on specific and extra portfolios. He understood that, by him taking on those portfolios, he could use his responsibilities against the wishes of the current ministers who were sworn in under those portfolio responsibilities. What the former Prime Minister was doing was secretly acquiring powers to be used against his own cabinet ministers. If you are secretly acquiring powers to use against cabinet ministers, surely letting someone know would be a pretty good idea? Surely you should have the decency to let the Australian people know about your intentional power grab against your own ministers and it should be made public? But, of course, that didn't happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was more. On 6 May 2021, long after those early days of the pandemic, the then Prime Minister decided to appoint himself as the Treasurer of Australia as well as the Minister for Home Affairs. Both of those portfolios have extraordinary powers. Both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Treasurer of Australia are senior portfolio positions. We had a prime minister who was intentionally acquiring portfolios and did not tell the then Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, nor did he tell the former Minister for Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This place matters, and the way in which executive government works matters. There must be an executive member in the chair at the dispatch box at all times because the executive is accountable to this place. The executive that runs our country is accountable to this building and to the Australian people when parliament is functioning. But the then Prime Minister not only didn't tell his colleagues or the Australian people that he was acquiring power to use against his colleagues; he was telling journalists! The former prime minister refused to come into this place or go on any national platform that he would have been given and tell people that he had actually acquired five different portfolios. But he knew this information was of interest, which is why he told two journalists, Mr Chambers and Mr Benson, for their book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Plague</span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span>. So the former prime minister was aware enough that he had acquired portfolios to use against his own cabinet colleagues, he was aware that the information was of enough interest that he wanted to tell journalists, but he didn't have the decency to say it in this place, he didn't have the decency to tell his own colleagues who were also on the executive serving under him and, worst of all, he didn't have the decency to tell the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know about you, but I like to think that every member of this place actually cares about the institution that we are privileged to represent in such that when we leave this place we can hold our heads high and say we served in this great institution to the best of our ability, because the Australian people deserve nothing less, and that we believe in this house of democracy, we believe in the House of Representatives and we believe that coming in here and serving our constituencies is a worthwhile profession. We're not in it for ourselves; we are in it to try to do something for our country. It is a great thing, and I know that people across all sides of politics believe in that. That is not something that is only to do with the Labor Party. Of course it's not. But coming with that is a respect for this place, and I hope the conservatives will join us in supporting this bill and saying that the undemocratic, secretive power grabs of the former prime minister, coming in this place and abusing the very institution that we are all proud to be a part of, should absolutely never happen again. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

Last year's federal election was nothing short of a wake-up call for Australia's elected representatives—the largest crossbench in history, an all-time low in our faith in democracy and the political whiplash from a generation of Australians who grew up in a decade of dishonesty in our parliament. I'm a firm believer in our Australian democracy and a firm believer that this House is capable of generational change for the better. I believe that change for a better future can start here and that change for the better starts with us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken before about the dangerous state of our democracy—the crisis of confidence that we are in, a generation of the disillusioned, a seismic structural shift in Australian politics. Since I last spoke on this, the 2022 Australian Election Study has been released. After every election, the Australian National University's Australian Election Study collects data from thousands of voters right across Australia, and it's been doing that since 1987. It looks at long-term trends across years and decades and lifts the lid on deep, long-running issues that aren't reflected in fortnightly polling.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until 2019, its findings on public faith in our democracy were not only disappointing but distressing. Satisfaction with Australian democracy was on a precipitous decline. In 2007, 86 per cent of Australians said they were satisfied with our democracy. In 2010, that fell to 72 per cent. In 2016, it fell again, to 60 per cent. In 2019, it fell again, to 59 per cent. By that point, more than a third of Australians were not satisfied with our democracy. The study also asked if people in government can be trusted. Again, the statistics show a strong decline. In 2007, 43 per cent of Australians said that politicians could be trusted. By 2010, it had fallen to 37 per cent. At the next election, it was 34 per cent. Then it was 26 per cent, and, in 2019, it was 25 per cent. Only 25 per cent of Australians said their politicians could be trusted. Three in four people didn't think their politicians could be trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May last year we had the first signs of a change to these statistics. With the release of the 2022 study, these trends began to change for the first time since 2007. Satisfaction with our democracy rose from a dangerously low 59 per cent to 70 per cent between 2019 and 2022. Mistrust in government actually went down, not up, for the first time. In 2022, the percentage of respondents who felt that the people in government only look after themselves dropped from an all-time high of 75 per cent in 2019 to 70 per cent in 2022. It's not a big drop, but it is moving in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly we have a long way to go before faith in our democracy is restored, but this is the first time in a long time that faith in our democracy has begun to rise. Support for reforms to strengthen our democracy is partly behind this reversal. The 2022 Australian Election Study also reported that 92 per cent of respondents either strongly supported or supported a national anticorruption body. Last year, we delivered on this very promise. This is just a first step on a long pathway towards restoring long-term faith in our democracy. We need to make sure this parliament is transparent, accountable and reliable. That is our responsibility. That is our mandate. That is our job. And that is exactly what this bill brings to the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fighting for our democracy takes not just the courage to speak out but the courage to act. Since taking government, the Albanese government has done just that. In eight months, we have established the National Anti-Corruption Commission, we have pushed for more representation for our First Nations people with a Voice to Parliament and now we are legislating safeguards against the undermining of the principles of responsible government that took place during the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments put forward today are the result of an independent inquiry into the conduct of the member for Cook during his time as Prime Minister. Between March 2020 and May 2021, as the country grappled with an ongoing public health crisis, the member for Cook appointed himself to no fewer than five additional portfolios. He became the minister for health; he became the minister for finance; he became the minister for industry, science, energy and resources; he became the Treasurer; and he became the minister for home affairs. An independent inquiry led by former High Court Justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC found that the fundamental principles of responsible government had been undermined by these actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reject the accusation that this was all the result of a political witch-hunt. Frankly, I find it concerning that the opposition would continue to undermine independent, responsible procedures of government by labelling the Bell inquiry 'a political witch-hunt'. Let's get the facts clear. This was an independent inquiry. It was not about the politics; it was about why this happened, how this happened and how we can prevent it from happening again in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Albanese Labor government on taking the inquiry's recommendations forward. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 forms one part of the government's response to Ms Bell's recommendations. Specifically, this bill puts an end to secret ministries and to the practice of dishonesty. It marks the start of a new era and a new approach to government—one defined by transparency, accountability and a commitment to democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, this bill demonstrates that the government is delivering on its promise to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity in public sector institutions, processes and officials. This bill will implement reforms to provide for greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration. The purpose of this bill is to implement the first of the six recommendations from the Bell inquiry, and it follows the steps the government has already taken to establish a powerful, transparent and independent National Anti-Corruption Commission. This government is committed to restoring faith in our democracy, to bring back integrity and accountability. Australians deserve to know who those appointed to be their ministers are, who their executive are and what offices they hold. Our democracy is precious, and it's our responsibility to protect it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I will make a short contribution, I hope, on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. The flame of democracy is a fragile thing. We often focus on threats from without, but the threats from within can be just as real and just as damaging. The tension between our parliament and our executive is real and it's deliberate. We must protect our democracy, and the actions of the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister, served to undermine that protection. It's the responsibility of every member here and, indeed, of every senator in the other place to nurture the flame of democracy, not to seek to snuff it out—not to seek to bulldoze it, if I can use that term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do recognise that some regard parliamentary democracy as an annoying hindrance to getting things done—to the executive just wanting to get their job done—but it is so essential. Democracy is an aim in and of itself—the idea, the notion, the dream, the vision of government of the people, by the people, for the people. It is an end in and of itself. It is as valuable to our society as trains running on time and roads being built. The actions by the member for Cook served to undermine the principles of our democracy and make our democracy weaker. The actions that we are taking today seek to strengthen our democracy and its foundations. The member for Cook, by his actions in appointing himself to a number of portfolios in secret, displayed a contempt for this place and its role, and that's been canvassed fully. The pandemic is no excuse. Australia is no stranger to crisis. We have suffered wars, we have suffered the Spanish flu pandemic, we have suffered droughts and floods. COVID was a convenient excuse for the former Prime Minister to do what he wanted to do because he thought it was the best way to get the job done as he saw fit. He had no respect for the role of this chamber and its place in our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply troubled by the fact that there have been so few speakers from the other side—indeed I have seen none listed, though I'm happy to be corrected if there have been speakers on this from the other side. Those opposite, by staying silent, are failing to stand up for our democracy and failing to stand up for the protection of it. Those on the other side are supposed to be the conservatives, the guardians of tradition, the guardians of institutions. Instead what we saw with the former Prime Minister in his contribution in defending his role in doing this was a conga line of so-called conservatives pretty much kissing his ring and saying, 'Job well done, mate.' So few have stood up in this place to defend our democracy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of jetting over to the US and socialising in Silicon Valley, the minister could have walked down to Glendenning in his own electorate and listened to what our manufacturers actually need from their government. They would tell you that their success depends on the government managing the economy in a way which creates the preconditions for their success. Those opposite should listen to what our Australian manufacturers are actually saying. Energy prices are sending them to the brink, businesses are being forced to drop products because supply chains aren't coping, and they can't expand because there aren't enough workers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does nothing for them. This bill is silent on the No. 1 issue that's raised by industry, whether you are an aluminium smelter, a pill pressing plant or a lumber mill. The coalition is opposing this bill because this arrogant government is telling our manufacturers what they think they need rather than addressing what manufacturers actually want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a minister that talks big about value-add onshore but sells out as soon as he gets back to his desk. The only value he's adding is to the offshore paper industry, wasting taxpayer dollars on $100-a-ream paper rather than $8-a-ream Australian-made paper which is used in every other printer in this place. As Labor tries to rush its National Reconstruction Fund through the parliament, it just demonstrates that while they talk the talk on supporting Australian manufacturers, they just don't walk the walk. Quite frankly, the minister's commitment to Australian manufacturing isn't worth the paper it's written on. Fancy Conqueror branded paper will not do anything to conquer the rising pressures on our manufacturing. The simple fact of the matter is that without addressing these key economic challenges which are holding industry back, government spending is useless.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the economic mismanagement of this government, any proposed financial support will be whittled away by increased input costs. Instead of reinventing economics and remaking capitalism, the government should focus on economics 101. Input costs affect the bottom line, and the price of energy is the first among those input costs for so many of our manufacturers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent survey conducted by the Australian Industry Group, 83 per cent of respondents experienced rising energy prices. In fact, it represented the highest score in the history of the survey. There hasn't been a single conversation I have had since I have taken on this portfolio where the cost of energy hasn't been raised as a concern. Take Solaris Paper: they have been manufacturing in Australia since the 1950s, with products including Sorbent toilet paper, Deeko serviettes and Handee Ultra Paper Towels. They are facing a tripled gas bill. Making their concerns public, they say that there is a real crisis looming. They said, '<span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xA;    color:#252525;&#xA;  ">It's a tremendous challenge for us,' and </span>'It is only one of our costs.' Regional Victorian manufacturer Advanced Bricks and Pavers announced they will let their brick oven go cold after 82 years of business. Why? Because they have gone from paying $6 a gigajoule of gas to more than $37 a gigajoule overnight. The bill offers no hope for manufacturers like second-generation family business Advanced Bricks. Each one of these closures has a human element to it—people out of work, craftsmanship lost and communities losing as a result. So many of our manufacturers rely on gas, yet this government's demonisation of this essential element does nothing but drive prices up. The industry minister thinks he can shirtfront the gas companies into submission and as a result prices will drop. I hate to break it to the minister, but that is not how economics works. A government divided on the issue with two cabinet ministers at loggerheads in a very public way also diminishes confidence in the supply of this critical resource. The Minister for Resources has one view and the minister for industry has another.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's mismanagement of energy policy is making a bad situation worse. Why do Australians always have to pay more under Labor? We know that, according to the Food Supply Chain Alliance, some businesses are facing 100 to 300 per cent increases in electricity costs, with a further 56 per cent rise foreshadowed in the October budget. Manufacturers can't afford this hit to their bottom line. The government claims it is prioritising manufacturers through the introduction of this legislation. The reality couldn't be further from the truth. This bill does nothing to ameliorate the input costs that are pushing businesses to the brink right now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor misled the Australian people at the last election, saying they would reduce energy prices. We know that the problem is much deeper than that, and it is not just inaction on energy costs hurting which is our industries. Supply chain disruptions and staff shortages have also been left unanswered by this government. This reconstruction bill does not fix these economic drivers which are making it impossible for manufacturers to do business in this country. The Food Supply Chain Alliance has said a 30 per cent increase in fuel bills is cutting into the viability of our hardworking industries every time their truck drivers hit the bowser.</span>

The Australian Industry Group says 90 per cent of businesses expect to be affected by staffing shortages. What has the government done to address this? There is no point to this bill reconstructing our manufacturing base if there is no-one to carry out that renewed effort. If they listened to our manufacturers they would know these are the issues they demand action on, instead of arrogantly telling them what they need. They did this with their radical industrial relations changes, putting a regulatory noose around the necks of manufacturers. They didn't care to listen. In case those opposite have short memories, this is what they said—and we know the Labor Party, when it suits them, is fond of walking into this House and quoting the business community. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that it would be 'particularly damaging given already serious global risks and uncertainty'. The Australian Industry Group called the secure jobs, better pay bill 'flawed and unnecessary', noting it would implement major and regressive changes to Australia's workplace relations arrangements that would set us back decades. But we know these trusted voices are not the ones those opposite listen to.</span>

Many Australians had to live through the last time industrial disputes wreaked havoc in our economy and they remember it vividly. That was when the then industrial relations minister, the member for Maribyrnong, chose to scrap the Australian Building Construction Commission, the last time the Labor Party was in government, and we know what happened. Unsurprisingly, the number of industrial disputes skyrocketed, the number of working-days lost rose and, as a result, the cost of infrastructure went up by 30 per cent. That means that infrastructure like hospitals, schools and roads all cost 30 per cent more than it had before—a direct consequence of Labor's ideological industrial-relations-induced mania. Have they learnt their lesson? Of course not. Instead, in a high-inflation environment, they are once again encouraging an uptick in industrial disputes, driving up inflation and putting pressure on our manufacturers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was disingenuous at its jobs summit and it's disingenuous about its consultation for this bill as it cuts corners to get this flawed bill through the House. The minister may be impatient when he is trying to ram through his flawed bill, but he has been on a real go-slow in his ministerial duties. Since the election, the government has dithered and delayed, failing to support our manufacturers in any substantive way. The government has delayed the provision of independently assessed grants funded by the coalition, conducted excessive politically motivated reviews and chopped and changed the national manufacturing priority areas. Entire industries have been put in a holding pattern whilst international competition continues to rise. The time it will take to establish the NRF will cumulatively cost our manufacturers some two years before they start seeing any government support for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing something like the NRF takes time—time to legislate, time to attract a board, time to hire staff, time to establish process, time to prepare funding streams, time to market, time to select applicants and time to settle contracts. The government has modelled the National Reconstruction Fund on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the CEFC. However, the National Reconstruction Fund is more complicated, as it invests in multiple industries. History shows us that the CEFC took three years to design, legislate and start making investments, with the Gillard government saying this was necessary due to the complexities involved. Indeed, so great was the task that a full Treasury review was commissioned to design the scheme, and let's not forget that this was for a fund into just one industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following all that work for what was a complex initiative, by the Gillard government's own admission, the CEFC was established in August 2012. The first investment was made in June 2013, some 10 months later. The government has signalled its intent to get money out the door as quickly as possible, but at best, it will be over a year from the election that the corporation will even effectively be formed and quite possibly another year before funding is issued to manufacturers. This is lost time for our manufacturers, prospective workers and economy, and it dampens prospects for investment. Our manufacturers can't afford to wait as their competitors forge ahead. Those on the frontiers in tech or on the cusp of medical breakthroughs and any manufacturer with a cutting-edge offering cannot sit idly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government announced that the National Reconstruction Fund should be up and running by next financial year, but they haven't committed to a launch date. They know it will take time. That's why they are rushing it through the parliament. They were quick to stop, stall and stifle any industry program from the coalition government but failed to replace it with any program. Worse, they are now rushing through a lengthy and lacking bill to compensate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's Modern Manufacturing Strategy was delivering for our manufacturers, and dismantling many of these measures was a mistake—a spiteful and partisan mistake by a bad Labor government—undermining what could have been a bridging gap between our programs in government and a properly designed and thoroughly consulted national reconstruction fund. Industry has told us that this type of funding model takes years to get right. Those will be lost years for manufacturers. Consultation has been rushed. Parliamentary oversight has been sidestepped. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill poses more questions than answers. The government's own departmental consultation only closed last Friday, and the government will have you believe that this feedback was thoroughly reviewed and workshopped with experts—and changes were made to the bill in only two working days. What a joke! The minister was clearly committed to reviewing the consultation—socialising with celebrities at black-tie events in Los Angeles and having birthday burgers with his caucus colleagues in the Hunter. We know ambition when we see it. I wish the minister for industry were as ambitious for our manufacturers as he is for himself. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is wilfully avoiding scrutiny and obfuscating consultation. That's because its flawed bill seeks to introduce significant ministerial discretion, which every taxpayer should be concerned about. The government really does give meaning to that word 'shortlist', because only a special handful have had a chance to contribute to the design of the bill. Unsurprisingly, this list included some frequent flyers to offices of those opposite—the Australian Council of Trade Unions, former Labor cabinet minister Anna Bligh, who heads up the ABA, and Industry Super Australia. Who would have thought! The Albanese accord strikes again: donations go in and policy comes out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill hasn't passed, but unions are already licking their lips at the prospect of the NRF, and they've listed their demands: a third of the board positions handpicked by the Council of Trade Unions, positions which will determine who gets access funding—an enterprise agreement with the unions a precondition to even making an application. Applicants must not have engaged in conduct that treats workers unfairly. That's a very vague way of saying if you're not with them you're against them. And they're demanding that applicants commit to direct employment, and if contractors or an indirect workforce is used they must be employed on the same conditions as the direct workforce. This essentially enshrines compulsory unionism, to be a successful applicant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister must, today, rule this out and immediately distance the government from such egregious outcomes. Of course, Labor will consult their faction bosses, the union movement and their donors from Industry Super. But given the significant ministerial discretion in this bill, it became clear something was not quite right. It says a lot about this bill that Ethical Clothing Australia, a CFMMEU front, believes they stand to gain from the NRF as recipients of a $6 million commitment before the election. The minister must explain how, during the election, support was promised from a fund that (1) hasn't been established, and (2) makes investment decisions via an independent board that is yet to be formed. It defies logic and certainly does not reflect the transparency and accountability the government led the Australian people to believe they would exemplify in office. It's the quid pro quo of the Albanese accord: money comes in; policy goes out. What a joke. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is symbolic of a deeper structural problem with this legislation. It's the typical 'cloak and dagger' politics those opposite engage in to benefit trade unions. In opposition, the Labor Party jumped up and down in fits of hysteria about what they perceived to be unfair allocations of funding by way of competitive grant processes. They claimed these were terrible, which their own review cleared as being completely appropriate. According to those opposite, grant funding is so terrible that this bill will outlaw grants which our industries have come to rely on, so terrible that the minister has instituted grant programs to work alongside the NRF. Can you believe anything that comes out of this government? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government promised the Australian people transparency, but what this bill seeks to enshrine by way of ministerial discretion is opaque beyond belief. This is incredible. Out of everyone in the hardworking textile industry, a union front gets the first funds from the NRF slush fund. Only the Labor Party would endorse an organisation with a rampant history of criminal conduct. Corrupt unions are doing well under Labor. No surprises there. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision will not provide any certainty to the taxpayer that this fund will be administered in the transparent and independent manner that the government promised. The Australian public aren't stupid. They know the fix is in. We know the Prime Minister and the minister for industry have provided assurances that the fund will be overseen by an independent board, but it's becoming clear that this board is likely to be stacked with union mates. It's difficult to foresee any other outcome when their first decision was to hand money to the CFMMEU. And this is a minister with form.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election, it's been revealed that Minister Husic rejected recommended ministerial appointments made by his department and instead installed others. More alarmingly, Minister Husic has made questionable appointments to committees demanding subject-matter expertise. Take his recent appointment to the Robotics Strategy Advisory Committee. Did he appoint a scientist? No. Did he appoint an engineer? No. Perhaps he appointed the head of an industry body? No. Minister Husic appointed the president of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Andrew Dettmer. Mr Dettmer is not your run-of-the-mill union boss. He's a self-labelled socialist who on social media publicly called the Leader of the Opposition a pig and called the Productivity Commission a front for neoliberal ideology. Sounds like he might also be moonlighting as the Treasurer's ghostwriter. A union boss, not a scientist, not an engineer—but, on Mr Dettmer's watch, the AMWU has donated millions of dollars to the ALP.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This dangerous bill allows the minister to appoint members of the board, the chair and indeed the committee. The minister will have direct discretion to appoint board members overseeing the rollout of a $15 billion taxpayer fund, leaving the door open to a situation where significant funding could be ticked off or denied at the whim of union officials. The coalition will be engaging with good faith in the Senate processes underway, unlike this bad Labor government. If the Senate processes ask for significant amendments, we will work constructively to that end. We will try to make a bad bill less bad.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are also issues with the funding model, which will enrich vested interests and leave small and family manufacturers behind. By ditching competitive grants with robust processes, the government cuts out a stream of funding which may be more accessible to many smaller manufacturers that just don't have the capabilities to apply for complicated equity or loan programs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question about the funding model is what will happen to failing or failed loans should an NRF recipient encounter economic uncertainty. At what point would the corporation withdraw its loan? How will the government manage these situations? Examples from similar ALP programs, such as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, have resulted in manufacturers being uprooted, with the taxpayer footing an expensive bill. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clarity on thresholds for applicants. Presuming that loans and equities will generate a higher threshold for applicants, how many manufacturers will be ineligible to apply? Will some industries be too risky to invest in? And what will happen to industries with diminishing margins, threatened by international competition? The NRF, by design, risks excluding certain industries and could become an idle fund if the thresholds are excessive. There are also concerns about crowding out investment. Government intervention will artificially distort capital markets. Each sector has different challenges, and a cookie-cutter approach won't satisfy each of these. This is just an old-fashioned Labor policy of spraying money around indiscriminately. If these investments were so promising and rates of return were viable, then why hasn't private capital funded them already? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The equity funding model is flawed because it also disregards the importance of ownership, which the minister would have registered if he'd actually taken the time to listen to manufacturers instead of prescribing what he thinks works. Many manufacturers that are family owned businesses would be reluctant to give up control of their business through an equity model. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This funding model will stifle innovation. It's a funding model that does not entertain failure, and, in some industries, innovation comes with an inherent amount of risk. The pressure of providing positive returns will disincentivise innovation, something which has put so many Australian success stories on the map. This funding model is seriously flawed—even more so because, on a political whim, you could cut a whole industry out of the national conversation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have shown they play politics with funding, and this bill does nothing but undermine investment certainty. What this bill shows us is that this Labor government is more interested in pursuing its agenda than keeping the course for our manufacturers. Prior to the election, this fund promised to be everything to everyone. These new priorities are vague, and they don't provide the focus needed to drive investment into specific sectors where we can achieve critical mass.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the coalition established six critical focus areas with specific priorities to maximise the impact of our resources. In their desire to establish their own NRF, Labor have spitefully redirected funds away from the National Manufacturing Priorities. Indeed, Ai Group note in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cuts to the Modern Manufacturing Initiative and Entrepreneurs Programme in 2022 deprive the NRF of two main pipelines for preparing innovative SMEs to be investment-ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was all done to lay the ground for the National Reconstruction Fund, a fund which, from the government's own legislation, will see zero dollars this financial year. With a tenth of the investment, the coalition government made real strides to support industry through some of their toughest years. Instead of supporting manufacturing in a bipartisan manner, the government has embarked on a brazen attempt to undermine the coalition's previous policy priorities, deprioritising our investments in the space industry, food and beverage, and complementary medicines. Complementary Medicines Australia noted in their submission that: 'Unlike the previous government's Modern Manufacturing Strategy, the NRF does not specifically identify complementary medicines as a high-value priority growth area. Furthermore, the funding mechanism provided by the NRF will not be as appealing to industry and it will therefore not deliver the same benefits as a model which provides grant funding.' The government must explain what, other than an election, precipitated this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's decision to abandon Australia's space industry as a policy priority has left a previously revitalised sector in a state of confusion and uncertainty. The minister has provided no reasoning as to why this massive policy shift has occurred. The industry was simply left to find out from department officials at Senate estimates that it was no longer a priority for this government. This important industry was set to create opportunities to grow, whether it be in rocket engines, component parts or satellites. Our dedication signalled our commitment to the industry and helped enable the first of three launches by NASA in the Northern Territory. I would note that there are Australians of whom we should be very proud who are heavily involved in further planned NASA launches to the moon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government were gutless in explaining their reasoning why this was no longer a priority. We have already heard from industry that their decision to wipe space as a priority will see manufacturers leave our shores. I call on a minister or other government member to come to this place and explain why they have taken this ill-informed step. This bill does nothing to provide a rethink or reconsideration of support to this crucial industry. Scrapping the space industry as a policy priority is short-sighted and it strips the manufacturing industry of a key pillar for forward-looking policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also concerned about the decision to scrap food and beverage manufacturing as a standalone priority for Australian industry. We laid out an ambitious plan to double the value of this industry by 2030. This boost could not be more crucial at a time when Australians are struggling with cost-of-living pressures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in the government's haste to put this legislation before the House they have ruthlessly ripped funding away from the successful Modern Manufacturing Initiative, which was delivering for families across the country who are feeling the pinch at the check-out. Every time they push the trolley through the check-out the cost of groceries is going up. The government could prevent future price shocks by encouraging sovereign capability in this sector, but instead they have chosen to sideline these crucial industries by lumping them in with an array of other sectors. The minister for agriculture even went so far as to state that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister said at the last election he would leave no-one behind. He is leaving whole industries behind. Every incoming government has the right to develop policies based on their priorities. We get that. However, it must be done based on expert advice, especially for our sovereign manufacturing base. Changing these priorities leaves investment decisions in limbo.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had six national priority sectors under our Modern Manufacturing Strategy.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Labor Party in this Albanese government, there is always a need for further scrutiny. This bill's explanatory memorandum states the remaining $10 billion appropriation can occur any time in the six years before July 2029. Ultimately the government's design choices in this bill add significant fiscal uncertainty around $15 billion that taxpayers have had to borrow by scrapping the established Modern Manufacturing Strategy and failing to address the numerous concerns our manufacturers face. So we don't support this legislation and we don't support the government's vain attempts to extricate itself from coalition policy that was delivering for Australian industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Minister, we do make things here in Australia, but that is at risk because of this government's go-slow. This government does nothing but pay lip service to our manufacturers, declaring it so without actually acting on the things our manufacturers are crying out for. Our industry deserves better than a minister who claims to represent them—an 'Aussie made' in public—but does something very different behind closed doors.</span>

We're out there in those industries, on those shop floors and at those manufacturing sites talking to the workforce, talking to the manufacturers, talking to the small businesses and talking to the medium businesses, and we're listening to what they tell us. They're telling us their key three priorities: energy prices not coming down, workforce shortages being desperate and disrupted supply chains are the three priorities they want this government to address in terms of its manufacturing policy, right here, right now, in this parliament. This bill does nothing to address those priorities. It addresses instead the priority of the Labor Party, which is the priority of the unions. That has been made very clear by the heavy involvement of unions that are anticipated to be on the board of this National Reconstruction Fund.</span>

We're there for our industries. We're backing them in, unlike this Prime Minister, who said he would leave no-one behind. He is leaving our manufacturing industries far behind. We will fight every day to ensure that their interests are front and centre. The coalition will be opposing this bill.</span>

Manufacturing combines some really important factors. One is education, another is innovation and, of course, there is that X factor—determination. These are the vital ingredients for a modern, prosperous economy, and we in the Albanese government are entirely future-focused on that one goal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians scanning their homes or workplaces would be hard pressed to find a product made in Australia. Once upon a time, not long ago, you may have had an Aussie-made appliance in your home or a car in the driveway. What happened? The wave of globalisation and free trade likely had something to do with it—the destruction, that is, of our manufacturing industry—but so did the lack of government oversight and foresight. Among OECD countries Australia ranks last for self-sufficient manufacturing capability, according to the Centre for Future Work's 2020 report. The aftermath of this neglect of our manufacturing sector was our impotence in the face of a public health emergency, the likes of which the world has never seen.</span>

Shortages of PPE like tight-fitting masks—the ones that save your life from a deadly virus when you have no vaccine—led to rationing.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our lack of sovereign capability had real consequences on the health system and the community. The work health and safety of healthcare workers was compromised. Over 3,000 healthcare workers in Victoria alone fell sick and outbreaks spread from healthcare and aged-care settings back into the community, prolonging lockdowns. This was all because we weren't making enough PPE here. Not having the right tools in the toolbox has knock-on effects. But this is not the only public health emergency, is it? The other, of course, is climate change.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's historic Climate Change Act, the first in a decade, signalled a complete about-face in our approach to climate change. We went from being climate deniers to climate doers. We see the climate crisis as the greatest economic opportunity for our country, and indeed it represents the second industrial revolution. One of the key bottlenecks to achieving our ambition of net zero by 2050 lies in industrial capability. Will we have enough solar panels, wind turbines, undersea cables, transmission lines and supporting infrastructure, especially when the rest of the world is clamouring for these goods? Will we be ready to scale up the future fuels for those hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, manufacturing or heavy industry? What do we do if we run out of lithium or its extraction becomes unviable?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Griem, publishing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nature Communications</span> in 2020, suggested that flipping over one billion light vehicles globally would result in an acute shortage of lithium. Investing in future fuels, such as biobutanol, dimethyl ether, methanol and renewable hydrocarbon biofuels, is paramount to growing the sustainability of our industrial sector. And that is entirely what we are focused on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the energy mix of the future, Australian innovation must be in the mix. I've been fortunate to meet some of those innovators of the future—people and companies who could be competitive recipients of investor funding or, indeed, our National Reconstruction Fund. Wave Swell Energy, led by one of my constituents John Brown and a team, represents an instructive case study. Harnessing the power of waves, the Wave Swell device positioned near the shore uses an oscillating column of air to turn a low-voltage generator. Inspired by nature's blowhole in Kiama, this innovation has no moving parts below the water so is impervious to the hostility of the ocean. An intriguing functionality is coastal mitigation because adjacent units, each weighing 11 tonnes, act as a breakwater. The company received $4 million in funding from ARENA—another Labor legacy—which enabled a successful pilot off King Island in Tasmania.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wave Swell Energy has won numerous awards—the latest being the Sir William Hudson 2022 engineers award in recognition of outstanding engineers who show innovation and excellence. It's a company we want to see succeed in Australia. Wave Swell Energy has garnered interest from countries around the world. A 2022 CSIRO analysis of this technology demonstrated that dependency on battery storage would decrease with a hybrid approach that included wave with solar and wind. In short, wave energy could reduce our reliance on battery storage because waves are less intermittent than either solar or wind. That's not a bad outcome when the world is clamouring for a resource like lithium.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of this company belies a struggle universal to emerging industries. We accept that some of this comes with the territory, but in a competitive world Australia can ill afford to treat its innovators badly. Our suboptimal track record in taking innovations to market is reflected in our rank of 25 in the Global Innovation Index. We are very good at creating knowledge given our global input rank of 19 but are let down by our conversion to market, denoted by an output rank of 32.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A moribund business investment environment in Australia, which had been declining for years under those opposite, means that the valley of death is a real prospect for early-stage businesses. This is where government has a role. We in the Albanese government want to give innovators an opportunity to make their products here on home soil. The NRF is Australia's biggest government investment in manufacturing in living memory. It is a $15 billion investment fund with a wide remit, focusing on seven priority areas informed by CSIRO's 2020 report <span style="font-style:italic;">COVID-19: recovery </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and resilience</span>. These seven priority areas are: resources; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; transport; medical science; renewables and low-emission tech; defence capability; and enabling capabilities like quantum robotics and AI, a subject I am very familiar with.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRF will be overseen by an independent board guided by experts in industry, finance and science appointed by the Minister for Industry and Science and the Minister for Finance. Investment decisions will be free from political interference, similar to current processes in ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. There will be no colour coded spreadsheets determining the manufacturing direction of our nation. The returns from investment will be reinvested in the NRF, much like the CEFC.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If only the NRF had been operating years ago, we would not be in the position of being the world's quarry of critical minerals delinked from manufacture of EVs and batteries. Australia is the world's largest producer of lithium, yet we capture less than one per cent of the value chain. There are 300-plus gigafactories around the world but none in Australia, despite us having the critical minerals for battery manufacture, coupled with an abundance of land and an overabundance, I might say, of talent. This must change. We want to see these industries take root and flourish here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of energy, I had the pleasure of meeting constituents Roland and Megan from Hybrid Energy. Hybrid Energy is using biomass to generate energy and a range of products of agricultural value which also address climate change. Sorghum can grow on marginal land. After combustion using biomethane derived from sorghum biomass, it turns into biochar, which acts as a soil improver and a fertiliser, while the oil that is a by-product of this process is a tonic for plants and also accelerates plant germination. Their visit left a smoky aroma in my office, the smell of opportunity. We have a place in the NRF for these kinds of innovations, and we want to see them flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Daniel Fischl, a constituent and the owner of Linnaea Vineyards, the only winemaker in Higgins—which produces, I might say, a fine drop; thank you, Daniel—shared with me his vast knowledge of viticulture, along with water innovations developed in Israel and California that will be vital for our farmers to survive the pressures of climate change. I may not have farms in Higgins, but I have no shortage of agtech experts like Daniel. The NRF will support these ideas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country, we are blessed with an embarrassment of natural resources. Our task is to take that abundance and value-add, thereby boosting our self-reliance and giving our people career pathways—not just jobs but careers—into manufacturing. A vibrant manufacturing sector will need to be supported by professional services, and that's where my constituents step in. Higgins cannot accommodate large manufacturing plants, but it certainly has no shortage of professionals in IT, design and human resources, as well as lawyers and financiers, to keep manufacturing here and humming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheap green energy will be pivotal to supporting manufacturing, and for that we have started the process of bringing large-scale renewable projects online. Transmission upgrades and offshore wind, as we have already announced, are part of our Powering Australia plan, our key to supplying the energy our fledgling industries will demand. Indeed, the transformation occurring in the North Sea off Britain is instructive. Vast offshore wind farms are cropping up where once oil rigs stood, and they are bringing green hydrogen, floating communities and even ecotourism and energy-hungry data centres. The same will occur in Australia—absolutely it will—and our regions and our cities will be the beneficiaries. When we link nation-building projects like high-speed rail—I had to throw that in—powered by our sunshine and made by Australian talent, the sky is the limit. I hope to see this evolve in my lifetime, but hope is not a strategy. The NRF Corporation is. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  The National Reconstruction Fund is a proposed $15 billion fund that would invest in key priority areas across the Australian economy with the goal of reviving Australian manufacturing, creating jobs for Australians and encouraging downstream processing to diversify, and to create the necessary complexity in our Australian economy. Australian manufacturing is in dire need of investment. Under the previous coalition government we saw the Australian economy become far less complex, a sort of 'dig it up, chop it down and ship it out' economy. We have seen good quality manufacturing jobs driven offshore by a government hostile to state-led investment. The death of car manufacturing is just one example of a job-intense manufacturing industry that suffered really badly; in fact, it was killed under the previous government. This trend must be reversed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support an active role for government in getting public money to where it needs to be. The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022 is a step towards an Australia that can add value to the raw materials we extract, a manufacturing nation that creates high-quality jobs across a diverse economy. At the last federal election, the Greens proposed a $15 billion 'made in Australia' bank to support finance and manufacturing, innovation, industrial decarbonisation and re-localisation of supply chains, a finance vehicle with a core purpose of driving the decarbonisation of Australia manufacturing and significantly reducing emissions in industrial processes. When the Greens set up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA with Labor, we built an Abbott-proof fence around it. We insisted on the legislation preventing public funds being directed away from clean energy and towards coal, gas, carbon capture or nuclear. This was actually baked into that legislation, and it saved the CEFC and ARENA from multiple attempts by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments to destroy or undermine it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Greens strongly support the government fostering new productive industries and diversifying our economy, we are deeply concerned by the extreme lack of specificity contained in this legislation for the National Reconstruction Fund. It could take us backwards on the climate emergency. Our final position on this bill in the Senate has not yet been determined. There is a real risk with this legislation that this government or subsequent governments have almost unlimited discretion to declare priority areas for a gas-fired recovery or a coalmine renaissance. There is a serious possibility that the NRF could be turned into a ministerial vessel for fossil fuel. Concerningly, there is nothing in the legislation itself to prevent investment in coal and gas or in projects that would lock in and extend the use of coal and gas. Anything the government of the day chooses to support could be declared NRF priorities in the future. Likewise, the scope of matters that a government can specify in the investment mandate, which is not disallowable, affords very considerable discretion. The only limiting factor on this are rules preventing a government from dictating that the NRF undertake a specific investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposed legislation, the minister would issue the investment mandate as a non-disallowable legislative instrument and declare the priority areas of the Australian economy in the form of a disallowable legislative instrument. The minister has provided a good deal of detail on the proposed priority areas, and we thank the minister for their collegiate approach, but the detail provided is effectively a moot point when there are so few limitations on what industries the government of the day can choose to direct the NRF towards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We Greens strongly support public investment in rebuilding manufacturing in Australia. We need to diversify our economy, but the legislation in its current form is wide open to abuse by governments that want to use the $15 billion for more coal and gas. That is a risk the Australian Greens simply cannot take. We need clear guardrails to stop public money being used to prop up coal and gas. For that reason, on behalf of the Greens, I will be moving amendments during consideration in detail that would rule out money from the NRF going towards coal and gas or towards native forest logging. These are reasonable amendments that would strengthen the NRF, protect it from abuse, allow the government to invest in reviving Australian manufacturing and decarbonise our economy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I rise today to contribute to the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022. How good is it to have a government that cares about Australia, about Australians and our future? Australia is the best country in the world, but the pandemic was a wake-up call. It showed us and the world that we aren't perfect. It showed that our supply chains are vulnerable. But it also showed that, when push came to shove, we pulled through. We need to make sure that we are more self-sufficient, more consistently. Along with the Buy Australian Plan and Made in Australia, the Reconstruction Fund is a part of this government's plan for Australia to be a strong and self-sufficient nation. This fund will help our country to have a renewed basis to sell to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fund is about bringing Australia back to its glory days. I remember the days when Australia made things and made things that were of high quality. Unfortunately, I also remember some of the regrettable haircuts from that time. While haircut styles may have improved, our manufacturing sector has gone the opposite way. This $15 billion fund will bring back Australian industry, and it will mean that we are again a country that makes things. Industry in Australia will diversify, so we make more of the things that Australians need. This will give Australians well-paid, secure jobs, our economy will grow and it will leave our country as a whole better off in the long run. We in the Labor Party are serious about creating about a better future for Australia and a better future for Australians. We will have the fund up and running by the middle of this year, and it will be one of Australia's biggest government investments in manufacturing in living memory. This will be a legacy that future generations will look back on and be grateful for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturing is my background. I know how it works. I know the capabilities we have here as a nation. Unfortunately, we aren't always meeting our potential in the area of manufacturing, but this is about to change. The National Reconstruction Fund will drive economic development in our regions, like my electorate of the Hunter, but also in outer suburbs all over Australia. The fund will boost our sovereign capability and will also diversify the nation's economy and help create secure jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Hunter is filled with skilled tradespeople. Working with our hands is what we do. This fund will ensure that workforces like those in the Hunter will be able to be used to their full potential. This is good for everyone in the Hunter, and I can't wait to see how much our area will develop and benefit from this fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government wants Australians to think globally and make locally. I know that's possible, because we have great businesses and the best manufacturing minds in the world. I know that Australian people are more than capable of fulfilling our potential. Australian businesses and the Australian people just need to have a government that backs them, and they want us to do that with this fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to do this the right way, in a way which won't require any colour coded spreadsheets like those used by the previous government. This is because in order to make the most of Australian skills, the way they vote should not be a consideration. This fund will be similar to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which, I might add, was also set up by Labor. Sometimes, to achieve the best results for our country, politics really needs to be left out of it. The investment decisions of this fund will be free from political interference. I can assure all Australians, and especially those in my electorate, that there will be no sports rorts and no car park rorts under this government. You deserve better, and we are providing that better. The NRF will have an independent board, which will assess projects at arm's length from government to provide equity loans and guarantees. This will help give Australians secure, well-paid jobs. That means this fund will be guided by industry and finance experts, who will help make decisions based on job creation and growing businesses and delivering on returns to the fund over longer terms to allow for reinvestment—all things that are important to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus of the National Reconstruction Fund will be wide ranging. This government will start consultation on several priority investment areas. That means we're harnessing the skills of a range of Australians with backgrounds in vastly different areas. We are a government that values its resources sector. This is one of the country's greatest strengths and provides some of the biggest opportunities. The Hunter is lucky to be the hub of resources in New South Wales, and I would like to thank Australia as a whole. I'm looking forward to seeing investment flow into our area once this fund is up and running. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to look at our agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors and determine how we can help them grow. Agriculture is vital to our nation. It provides the food we need to survive. We are blessed in this country to have a strong agriculture sector and one that is eager to grow. This is another exciting opportunity for the Hunter. Agriculture is in the area and already so strong, yet it has the ability to grow significantly. Forestry is also an important sector and one that has a significant role to play in solving issues we're currently facing in this country. The sector has a lot to offer, from helping us increase supply of affordable housing to playing its part in reducing the CO2 in our atmosphere. Lowering emissions will need to be a major focus of government in Australia in the coming decades. This fund provides an engine that will encourage investment and assist in the renewables sector and development of low-emissions technologies. This is a huge opportunity for Australia to lead the world in emissions reduction and renewable energy technology, and this fund is giving us a head start on the rest of the world. Another area for the future is quantum robotics and AI. These are areas that this fund will also prioritise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This really goes to show just how forward thinking this government is. This fund is wide ranging and goes from looking at the resources and agriculture sector to the medical and science areas. The modern world of medicine is amazing, and Australia has some of the best medical minds in the world. With the additional support provided to the sector by the National Reconstruction Fund, I am sure we'll see some huge medical advancements right here in our own country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a prime minister who is a transport enthusiast and a former transport minister, so how could we leave out the transport industry from this list of priorities? On a serious note, transport is a vital sector for our country and one where we have vast opportunities for growth and investment. As everyone in this place is aware, this is an ever-changing world and it's more important than ever that as a nation we are consistently ensuring that we are protecting our national security. That's why this fund also prioritises defence capabilities. It is vital to keep up with the rest of the world. It is also very important that we have the ability to defend ourselves when needed. So not only will this fund help our country to grow but it will also help to protect our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this leads to one conclusion: the future is bright, and it's all thanks to our Labor government. The National Reconstruction Fund will bring back manufacturing and industry to our great country and will create a better future for Australians. I can't wait to see what opportunities this will bring for the Hunter. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I rise in support of the government's National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022. I am delighted to be speaking on a bill that introduces what I feel is a very exciting opportunity for Australian industry, innovation and entrepreneurship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill moves us forward from merely talking about becoming a renewable energy superpower to actually implementing practical steps to get there. This bill is very welcome news for industries all over the country, including in my electorate of Mackellar. If we do not invest now in clever technology, manufacturing and value-adding, we will simply be left behind, left to the mercy of international events like COVID and conflict. As the Business Council of Australia suggests, the longer we leave this diversification and futureproofing of our economy, the harder it will be to catch up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a lot of talk in recent months and years about the capacity of Australia to become a global renewable energy superpower, about finally moving on from the 'dig it and ship it' mentality, about progressing from being 'the lucky country' to 'the clever country'. We've heard talk of restoring and building our manufacturing and value-adding capacity onshore, about driving investment in home-grown technologies so our own innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs don't have to take their ideas and technologies overseas for them to be commercialised. This bill will enact practical measures to move Australia closer to all these goals. This policy is as urgent as it is long overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of this bill is to diversify and transform Australia's industry and economy. The proposed fund will, over seven years, co-invest a total of $15 billion in independently assessed projects across seven priority areas. This is very welcome news in my community of Mackellar, where many innovators have met with me both to inform me of their ideas and innovations and to let me know of the desperate need for investment to establish and grow their products. It is these cutting-edge enterprises that will be well placed to benefit from the National Reconstruction Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor, I am pleased to note that medical science is named as one of the seven priority investment areas and that the minister has already announced $1.5 billion for investments in medical manufacturing. The COVID pandemic starkly exposed just what a vulnerable position Australia was in when it came to medical manufacturing. Mackellar is home to several small to medium medical device and equipment manufacturing companies, so to have this field recognised as an investment priority is very welcome news indeed for these businesses and for jobs in Mackellar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Co-Chair of the newly established Parliamentary Friends of Future Generations, I was also pleased to see robotics, artificial intelligence and quantum technology listed as priority areas. We need to raise our gaze beyond the three-year election cycle and invest in a safe and flourishing future for all those who come after us. We have a duty not only to those who are currently alive but to future generations also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, as a newly elected member of parliament who decided to run because of the lack of political action on climate change for so many years, I was glad to learn that the biggest single priority investment to be made by the fund, some $3 billion, will be invested into renewable and low-emissions technology. The inclusion of this as a priority for the NRF draws together two key strands of Australia's climate policy which I fully support—the transition away from old, polluting fossil fuel energy production and doing so in a way which builds national prosperity by creating a plethora of well-paid clean-tech jobs for Australians across the country. There is a global technology revolution on our doorstep, and our communities and businesses are champing at the bit to take advantage of it. Other countries are certainly taking advantage to encourage the innovation and the transition to a clean economy. The United States government last year committed $500 billion in new spending with the Inflation Reduction Act. Critically, this act is directed at increasing the funding of innovative solutions for carbon reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to many entrepreneurs and senior executives in my electorate who are currently caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place when it comes to the growth of their businesses. These are innovative, forward-thinking and purpose-driven businesses eager to develop their technology at home in Australia, both for the good of our country and for the good of the planet. They don't want to be forced to go offshore because of a lack of investment interest here, but they are struggling with the current policy settings and investment conditions in Australia. As a result, such companies are increasingly being drawn overseas to jurisdictions with more favourable conditions—jurisdictions like America who are taking the transition to renewable energy increasingly seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all this in mind, it was disappointing to hear that the opposition have stated that they will not be supporting the introduction of the National Reconstruction Fund. This is from a party that claims to be pro business and to care about the economy. I instead agree with the Business Council of Australia when they say that we must put the foot on the accelerator when it comes to diversifying our economy into the high-tech clean-energy sector and other future technology, because this is how we will maintain our current high standard of living into the future. We must invest now in our future, or we will be left behind. So I support this policy and its objectives. It has long-term vision and ambition. If it works, it will be a game changer for Australian industry and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I have a couple of caveats. First of all, I support the Greens' proposed amendments: that it must be made explicit in this bill that the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation be prohibited from investing in anything that involves logging of native forests, the building of new infrastructure for fossil fuel projects, or any projects inconsistent with emissions reduction targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, a key priority of mine is to ensure that our government institutions are underpinned by a robust integrity infrastructure, and so we must examine whether this bill, which proposes to create a body that will oversee the disbursement of $15 billion to businesses, actually contains the appropriate underlying integrity infrastructure to ensure it operates fairly and in the manner envisaged. The government tells us that the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation will be managed by an independent board that aims to deliver a positive rate of return to the taxpayer. But what does it really mean when the government says the board will be independent? How will the board members be appointed, and what will their powers be?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clauses 18 to 21 of the bill establish that the board members are to be appointed by the minister or relevant ministers for a period not exceeding five years and may be reappointed. To be appointed, board members must have 'substantial experience or expertise' and 'professional credibility and significant standing' in one of a list of various fields, including 'any other field that the ministers consider appropriate'. Those provisions seek to address merit, which is good. However, there are no guarantees of transparency, accountability or, critically, independence from the minister. The government's own literature on the bill, which guarantees an independent board, therefore actually contains no guarantee at all. Instead the two relevant ministers, the Minister for Industry and Science and the Minister for Finance, will have complete discretion over appointments to the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A vital ingredient of integrity in our public appointments process is independence, and to say, 'Well, this is the way it's always been,' just doesn't cut it anymore. Australians need to be able to trust the institutions and entities that underpin our democracy, and that means applying a uniform and robust approach to all major government appointments—one that is independent, transparent and based on the quality of a candidate, where board appointments are decided by an independent selection panel. I will soon be introducing a private member's bill called the Transparent and Quality Public Appointments Bill, otherwise known as 'ending jobs for mates'. It is this type of gold-standard model that should be adhered to to ensure that the NRF is not rorted or corrupted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these caveats in mind, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  Innovation, reconstruction and growth, because manufacturing matters! The Albanese government was elected on a mandate to drive the transformation of Australian industry and revive our ability to make world-class products in Australia again—to be a country that makes things again. Manufacturing matters because it creates full-time, meaningful work and secure jobs. It matters because secure work is good for families and for the economy. We saw through the pandemic—particularly in my time in the emergency department—how supply chains were under huge pressure. They were strained. Products that we expected and used frequently, particularly in the medical space, were hard to obtain. We need to revitalise manufacturing after years of neglect under those opposite. The former coalition government crushed and starved our domestic manufacturing capability. It is a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund is vital to support and to diversify Australia's industry and to create sustainable, secure, well-paying jobs. The NRF will provide finance, including loans, guarantees and equity, to drive investments in seven priority areas in the Australian economy. These leverage Australia's natural and competitive strengths, support the development of strategically important industries and secure those supply chains. Those priority areas are: value-add in resources, to expand Australia's mining science technology and ensure that a greater share of raw minerals extracted in Australia are produced domestically—for example, high purity alumina from red mud and bauxite—and processing or lithium processing for batteries like the one we have committed to for Narara on the New South Wales Central Coast; value-add in the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors; unlocking the potential and value-add to raw materials in sectors like food processing, textiles clothing and footwear manufacturing; transport—something that is quite close and personal to the now Prime Minister and previous minister for infrastructure and to myself, the member for Robertson—to develop capabilities in transport manufacturing and supply chains, including cars, trains and shipbuilding—something that that mob over there let die. Transport for a connected Australia is vital, from the regions to the cities and out into our more rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is medical science, which is so important, as a member was discussing just previously, to leverage Australia's world-leading research to provide essential supplies such as medical devices, personal protective equipment—which we did not have at the start of the pandemic—medicines and vaccines. All are vital to strengthen our clinical operations, improve patient safety and ensure the health care of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewables and low-emission technologies is another area to pursue commercial opportunities, including components for wind turbines, production of batteries and solar panels, new livestock feed to reduce methane emissions, modernising steel and aluminium, hydrogen electrolysers, and innovative packaging solutions to reduce waste. Further defence capability is important in a time of heightened global risk and heightened global uncertainty. And there is maximising sourcing of requirements from Australian suppliers and employing Australian workers, whether they be in technology, infrastructure or skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRF will target projects that help Australia capture new market opportunities to help our businesses grow and succeed. This is important because businesses have been left behind over the last decade by those opposite. They were left behind by the former coalition government because those opposite do not care about business and they do not care about the economy. This includes NRF finance to grow advanced manufacturing and support businesses to innovate. As a co-investment fund, the NRF looks to draw on investment with superannuation, venture capital and private equity sources, crowding in investment to help create high-quality, sustainable industries and jobs. This is our government, the Albanese Labor government, improving the lives of Australians and revitalising our manufacturing base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modelled on the successful Clean Energy Finance Corporation—or CEFC—this bill establishes the NRF as a new corporate Commonwealth entity. The NRF will be administered at arm's length from government by an independent board appointed jointly by the Minister for Industry and Science and the Minister for Finance. The government will provide guidance on expectations and policy priorities through a legislative instrument and an investment mandate. The board will independently make investment decisions and manage its investment portfolio to achieve both the NRF's objectives and a positive portfolio rate of return, free from political influence, and a very different approach from those opposite. The very different approach is that there won't be a colour coded spreadsheet in sight on this side. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's long been an argument made that government has no role to play in picking winners, no role to play in guiding industry, and no role to play other than establishing guardrails, letting businesses do their thing and only stepping in when there's been market failure. Governments absolutely have a role in making real contributions to our most vital sectors, of which manufacturing is one. Australia is rich in critical resources—resources to be used to build our manufacturing base, add value, and, as I said before, create secure jobs right here in Australia. But, for decades, we've mined those resources and then we've shipped them overseas, only for other countries to process them and add value to them. Then we import them back at many times the price, sending manufacturing—more importantly, sending jobs—offshore and therefore sending the manufacturing industry, and their profits and the thousands of jobs they create, overseas. If we mine it here then we should make it here, because these are our resources. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's scientists and our innovators are the best in the world. Photovoltaic technology, solar cells—they were invented here; they were invented in Australia. But, today, 87 per cent of the world's cells are made in one country. As the world urgently—and rightly so—focuses on decarbonisation, the transition to renewables and low-emissions technologies will be vital in delivering Australia's emissions reduction target of 43 per cent. If we invent it here, then we should make it here. We want Australians living overseas—with their ideas, with their technology and with their manufacturing experience—to come back home. We recognise that many of them with experience in these fields left Australia seeking support and funding for their ideas because, over the last decade, that support was not here. It was support and funding that they just could not find here at home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to empower the NRF to invest in Australia and Australians, because it's Australian ideas and it's Australian ingenuity. Both this bill and the investment mandate guiding investments will make sure that the $15 billion fund drives Australia's natural inclination towards innovation. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources has consulted widely both on the strength of the legislation and, most recently, on how the NRF will be implemented. Co-investment plans will be developed with industry, and these will outline investment opportunities in priority areas and actions for government and actions for industry to build Australia's industrial capabilities. The plans are expected to be released soon, and I will say again: innovation, reconstruction and growth, and that is because manufacturing matters. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides an opportunity to put another big crack in that ceiling. I encourage the minister and the government to walk the talk and grasp that chance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation nominates seven priority sectors of the economy: resources; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; transport; medical science; renewables and low emission technologies; defence capability; and enabling capabilities. Spot the common theme? Most of them require STEM skills. What do we know about that? Women and girls are previously underrepresented. Author Emily Chang notes that in the United States in 1984 women received nearly 40 per cent of all computer science degrees. Today that figure is down to 22 per cent. In Australia, figures compiled by the industry department revealed that women make up only 36 per cent of enrolments in university STEM courses and just 16 per cent in vocational STEM. Women make up only 27 per cent of the workforce across all STEM industries, down from 2020. Just 23 per cent of senior management and eight per cent of chief executives in STEM qualified industries are women. This is one of the reasons the gender pay gap in Australia is an appalling 14.1 per cent for full-time workers and in some sectors is as high as 30 per cent. If the government is right, it will take another 26 years to close that gap. By then, my 14-year-old daughter will be 40. I am not prepared to wait that long, and nor is she. Nor are tens of thousands of teenage girls just like her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I happened to be interviewed on Sky News last week about the government's decision to legislate gender pay gap transparency for companies with 100 or more workers. I advocated for this throughout the election campaign, and very specifically at the Jobs and Skills Summit in September. I am pleased, therefore, to be talking about this progress. However, the irony of the interview on Sky is that the vision that appeared on the screen with my talking head began with a group of men in hi vis. This is the issue writ small. We have a tight labour market and a skills shortage you could drive a truck through. All the credible evidence is that concrete steps to entrench gender equality across the economy would add between 500,000 and one million female workers. It would be great for them, great for productivity, great for growth, great for our children and great for our prosperity. It also requires access to apprenticeships and safety in trades for women. We have an opportunity to make sure the renewables revolution fosters women into trades, so let's make sure women are catered for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is the reason that I have proposed to the minister that some key elements be added to this legislation to address the issues of gender disadvantage and diversity. The net effect of such an addition would be that, when considering applications for government loans and assistance, the National Reconstruction Fund would consider the commitment of the organisations receiving the funds to levelling the playing field. That is appropriate if we are serious about creating workplace gender equality, and I thank the minister for welcoming this thinking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the minister that, for the sake of our future productivity and prosperity, and to ensure that our children can have secure, well-paying jobs, we must rank among the nations with complex economies, advanced manufacturing and thriving technology exports. Our recent difficulties with China warn what could happen if we remain too dependent for our wealth on exporting commodities. COVID-19 was a warning of what can happen when international circumstances stop travellers from coming here. For too long we have seen good ideas developed by Australian scientists and entrepreneurs sent into exile overseas, so foreign companies reap the financial benefit, whether it be the black box flight recorder or wi-fi.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen what a success the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has proved to be, despite the best efforts of the last government to get rid of it. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the model for the National Reconstruction Fund. I hear the minister's assurance that money from the fund will be independently assessed; however, this requires constant oversight. There is a further level of caution required, as the IMF has warned with regard to the potential inflationary impact of the scheme. Spending must be accompanied by productivity gains. Those sitting on the fund's board must be experienced in industry to guide that productivity growth through targeted funding. The last thing we need is public money being spent on the basis of electoral advantage rather than the independently prioritised needs of the broader Australian community. The government would do well to note the community's distaste for pork-barrelling and how that was reflected last May.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need initiatives to transform, modernise and diversify our economy, particularly targeting components aligned to the renewable energy revolution. But there's a further matter to consider. This fund must not become cover for fossil fuel investment. Indeed, the title of the fund might well be better phrased as the 'national destruction fund' if it's used to support fossil fuel developments, particularly new ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the fund to work, there needs to be agreement by all sides that we're committing to investment and transformation over the long term—at least a decade. It needs be taken off the political agenda and added to the national interest agenda. The fund must recruit, utilise and consult people who have been central to industry creation, modernisation and transition. With respect to investment bankers, they don't build industries. And we're not talking about just one sector; we're talking about an entire economy. This requires leaders who have run companies, who have created and scaled globally, who have bought and sold companies, and who have transformed underperforming companies. It needs people who have a black book to customers and co-investors and who can help companies grow with an understanding of geopolitics—a mix of Australians and global Australians—as the world transitions from fossil fuels to a high-growth and sustainable new-generation economy. This fund should be a vehicle for forward movement and new technology on renewable energy and on diversification of industry when it comes to elevating women and other disadvantaged cohorts, including First Nations people and multicultural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to my original point, I promised the Goldstein community, especially our women and girls, that, if I got into this room where it happens, I would speak up for those who are not in the room. Over time, I would suggest that every piece of work and industry related legislation should have a gender impact statement. Perhaps, if we did that, our daughters wouldn't be almost my age by the time they have true equality.</span>

                    <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  What an exciting day today to speak in support of the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022! Over the last nine months in government, we have introduced a lot of really important legislation. It has been an incredibly busy time, trying to set our country on the right path for a better future. But today I am particularly excited because this bill sets out how we will deliver so many of the core promises we made at the election, setting up our country for a self-sustaining better future: secure jobs, support for farming, safeguarding our national sovereignty, transitioning to a renewable energy future, investing in our regions and creating a stronger and more prosperous Australia. This bill does it all, and all through a co-investment fund generating enough return to sustain its future rate of investment—jobs, jobs, jobs. Actually, scratch that. Make it: Australian jobs, jobs, jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how are we going to do that? The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation will partner with industry and investors to provide finance for projects that add value, improve productivity and support the transformation of Australian industry. Modelled after the highly successful Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the NRFC will provide finance, including loans, guarantees and equity, to drive investments across seven priority areas of the Australian economy. These are: value-add in resources; value-add in agriculture, forestry and the fisheries sector; transport; medical science; renewables and low-emissions technologies; defence capability; and enabling capabilities. We will target projects and investments that help Australia capture new high-value market opportunities, to help local businesses grow and succeed in the industries of today and the industries of tomorrow. For far too long Australia has exported our resources, our talents and our opportunities. The Albanese government is determined to put Australians first, investing in Australian ideas, Australian businesses and Australian people to keep them here instead of driving them to more supportive economies overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, we have historically had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. With a strong defence industry presence, strong manufacturing base, and abundant farming and agriculture industries, our region has the capability of driving Australia's future economic growth. All that has been missing is a government willing to back in Australian-made, investment in local businesses and farmers, and support our transition into the economy of tomorrow. We are already seeing local industry drive this transition. We are seeing farmers embracing new clean sustainability practices, because they know it is good business and good for their future. We have seen local defence industry pivot its operations to cope with the new challenges thrown at us by the pandemic. We have seen community organisations partnering across the education and energy sectors to explore the feasibility of new energy generation; local people in my electorate looking to find opportunities in the black void that has been government policy. I am absolutely delighted to see that black hole well and truly closing right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government simply must be leading the way. We simply must be providing the guidance, the leadership, the certainty that those looking to invest need. If they can see the government believing in Australian-made then they will too. That is what this fund will do. With a clear investment mandate to spend its $15 billion fund on solely or mainly Australian based investments, the NRF will play to our current and emerging industrial strengths and strategic national priorities, all while it becomes a self-sustaining fund through a requirement to generate a positive portfolio rate of return. What a breath of fresh air for our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shoalhaven has a strong and thriving defence industry. Local Nowra businesses are leading the way when it comes to Australia's strategic defence capabilities. We are home to the only Navy air station, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, and Jervis Bay boasts the Royal Australian Navy College at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>. So it is fair to say we have both the need and the know-how when it comes to defence capability. Defence and defence industry are our biggest employers, but, until recently, much of our defence manufacturing has been exported overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year I had the privilege of touring Air Affairs Australia, one of our major defence industry partners located in Nowra. Air Affairs specialises in aviation operations and engineering, but, before the pandemic, 70 per cent of its business was exported. It was a local Nowra based company in demand across the world but with only 30 per cent of its products staying here in Australia. Why? Because instead of investing in homegrown innovation, much of the equipment Defence sourced was imported. When the pandemic hit, this created a predictable problem, one which Air Affairs and many others were happily there to solve. This is just one example of how government's failure to invest, encourage and grow local innovation has seen other countries reap the benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reliance on overseas supply chains and overseas manufacturing and our lack of investment in Australian-made over so many decades created a weakness that became truly evident when those supply chains were interrupted and broken. Luckily for Australian defence, Air Affairs was able to pivot its operations during this critical phase to increase domestic supply, and now 90 per cent of its products are for the domestic market. To be clear, this is not because its exports dropped off; it is because domestic operation ramped up incredibly fast to meet an urgent and unexpected need. Air Affairs is only one example of this, and we have many other fantastic defence industry partners located in the Shoalhaven who have been doing just the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend I visited Global Defence Solutions at the Nowra show and was reminded of the great work they are doing to supply solutions for defence. The Shoalhaven Defence Industry Group does a fantastic job promoting the work of so many companies locally and at the dedicated Albatross Aviation Technology Park, designed specifically to support defence and aviation industries right next to HMAS Albatross. I got a preview of some of the great work they are doing at the University of Wollongong's defence industry showcase last year. What this shows me is that there is incredible growth opportunity waiting to be realised right here on the south coast. We have the industry already there, we have the space, we have the history and, boy, can we rally when the opportunity calls. So I couldn't be more excited that one of the seven priority areas for the NRF is defence capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nowhere in Australia as well equipped as the Shoalhaven to reap the benefits of this investment in our local innovation, maximising the sourcing of our defence requirements from Australian suppliers, employing Australian workers in technology, infrastructure and skills—Australian jobs, jobs, jobs. What a mantra. Not only this; defence industry can help to build skills from the ground up, working with local high schools to start a love of clean, advanced manufacturing, employing trades from apprentice level up across so many industries: manufacturing, processing, electrical, painting and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things regional areas like ours struggle with is secure jobs for young people. Our youth unemployment rate has been stubbornly high for far too long. Too many local kids either leave to get good jobs in the city or struggle to find work—not a choice any parent wants to see their child face; not a choice anyone should have to make. We know that investing in the future of young people pays dividends across our community in education; in secure, well-paid jobs; and in a strong future in our regional communities, with so many social and economic gains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is everything I have wanted for our community for so many years and one of the very reasons I entered politics in the first place. I worked for years as a TAFE teacher, working with young and mature-age people to guide them into careers, not just jobs. I could see the need and the gaps we had, and it just wasn't good enough. I'm a mum of four kids. I want them, like each and every young person across our South Coast, to have the future they want and a career they can be proud of in a secure, well-paid job at home. I am so incredibly proud that this vision I have for the future of our community is also the vision that the Albanese government has for the future of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another industry close to my heart, and the other side of the coin for my entry into politics, was agriculture. I am a dairy farmer's daughter. I grew up on a dairy farm. What I have seen is an industry getting left behind by a lack of investment and a lack of interest from government in improving and supporting our agricultural industries. Agriculture is the lifeblood of the regions. It's where we started and it's where the hearts of so many lie. But agriculture across Australia is facing so many challenges, not least of all from a transitioning economy and a changing climate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other seven priority areas of the NRF is to value-add in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, unlocking the potential and value-adding to raw materials in sectors like food processing, and textiles, clothing and footwear manufacturing. As I have mentioned before in this place, our agricultural industries are already starting this change. There are companies like AKT Oceania, based in Nowra and focusing on improving organic waste streams by extracting proteins and nutrients for use in other industries. They create animal feeds like fishmeal and more to get the most out of organic waste. But much of the equipment is manufactured overseas, and what they need is support and investment by government to grow these industries here. We've got seaweed plants and cow manure farms. We've got a former abattoir being transformed into the Southern Hemisphere's largest fish-processing plant. We've got agricultural innovation on steroids, sustainability with benefits across agriculture and more, and innovation that's homegrown. This is what we need, and it is these sorts of investment that the NRF will be able to encourage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as having the agricultural industries, the South Coast is home to a growing manufacturing industry, making us perfectly placed to benefit from the investment opportunities this fund will bring by capitalising on what we have, stimulating our economic growth, investing in our existing industries and helping them to diversify. I'll say it again: Australian jobs, jobs, jobs, supporting local business, supporting local people, growing our economy and securing our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other huge focus of the NRF is of course our transition to renewable energy. Renewables and low-emissions technologies will be a priority area for the NRF. This includes pursuing commercial opportunities from components for wind turbines, production of batteries and solar panels, new livestock feed to reduce methane emissions, modernising steel and aluminium hydrogen electrolysers and innovative packaging solutions to reduce waste. It is a fact that the world is decarbonising, and increasingly we need to be focusing on a transition to renewables. We have known for decades that Australia has a unique opportunity to capitalise on this transition. We have some of the best natural wind and solar resources in the world. But so far we have squandered the economic benefits and opportunities this transition could be creating, particularly in regional areas like the New South Wales South Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is determined to change this. We have committed to reducing our emissions by 43 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We simply must put our back into capitalising on our homegrown technology and skills to make this a reality. The technology and skills are there, but for far too long we have watched them leave our shores to benefit someone else who saw the benefits and invested in it. Our scientists and innovators are the best in the world. We invented solar panels, but someone else is making them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of this fund is simple: if we invent it here, we should make it here. We are empowering the NRFC to invest in Australians. We have earmarked $3 billion from the NRF for our Powering Australia plan. This fund will drive investments in areas like clean energy component manufacturing and technologies that improve energy efficiency, helping to deliver affordable, reliable and clean energy to Australian industry over the longer term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2019-20 bushfires the South Coast community saw what happens when we have an energy system vulnerable to natural disasters. Our old-school electricity grid was left exposed, and we suffered through extended blackouts. Local people had no power, no telecommunications, no information about the oncoming firestorm and no way of getting help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We weren't without power for a few hours; we were without it for days and weeks. We struggled with food supplies, water supplies and medical equipment, not to mention the blazing heat. It is something we all never want to see repeated. For many the answer to this problem is simple—solar power and battery backup so that our community halls, our evacuation centres, our homes and our farms aren't reliant on mains power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Coast community is crying out for investment in solar, investment in batteries and investment in renewables. Renewable energy can help build our resilience and better prepare us for natural disasters. We must start investing in this future now. The best way to do this is to build it at home, create jobs at home, shore up our supply chains and transition us to the clean energy future now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales South Coast is poised and ready to become a renewable energy powerhouse. What we need is investment security and support, and this bill delivers that in spades—a future made in Australia, secure well-paid jobs created using an independent, fair and self-sustaining model, partnering with industry, that we know works. It's a better future, just like we promised. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  That was a most curious speech by the member for Gilmore, the last speaker. She represents Nowra, which I understand is the home of the ethanol industry in Australia. She is in the government. Quite interestingly, I have a map here of countries not using ethanol. There are hardly any countries on earth that are not using ethanol. I hold the map up for everyone to see. These countries are not using ethanol: Sahara, Ghana, Iceland, Myanmar, Greenland, Bolivia, Senegal and the Congo. She stood up here and said we're going to use renewables and yet she represents what tiny little ethanol industry we have. To quote the Labor Premier of New South Wales, I will not go another day with the death of hundreds, maybe thousands, of people on my conscience when they don't have to die. If you move from Forbes, Parkes or Nowra to Sydney, your chances of dying of lung cancer or heart disease double. That's one hell of a statistic. That's because of what is in the emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have actually got legislation drafted for electric cars, but you will never—not in a million years—be able to pack the power into a battery that you've got in one kilo of fuel. You can make that fuel renewable so you have no emissions, yet we're up there with Niger, the Congo and Iceland in doing nothing about it. My case rests. I go no further than ethanol. All you have to do tomorrow is pass legislation saying 10 per cent ethanol, and you might end up like Brazil with 49 per cent of fuel renewable. Sao Paulo is the cleanest city on earth and it has a bigger population than Australia. You might get your fuel for $1.29 like they do in Brazil, with 49 per cent of their fuel coming from ethanol, from renewables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear all this grand ideology in this place. We have a saying in the bush: when you neighbour starts preaching religion, reach for your branding iron. When I hear politicians start talking ideology, I start reaching for my shooting iron, to be quite frank with you, Mr Speaker. We announced the nuclear submarines. It is terrible to have been in this place for some time, because you know that 28 years ago we announced the nuclear submarines we were going to build, and we're still announcing them. In fact, every two or three years we announce the building of nuclear submarines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are you doing? Don't talk about ideology or airy-fairy ideas about saving the planet. What are you doing specifically? The most obvious thing to do is ethanol. What are you doing? Nothing, absolutely nothing. There is an inability of the government today—as a person who has seen many years, I get very worried for democracy. Five of the last presidents of the United States spent most of that time trying to fight off going to jail. I don't believe that five of eight presidents were all criminals, but it's a failure of democracy and the triumph of the two-party system, which, quite frankly, has been abandoned by every country on earth, now, except the United States, and they have to live with their constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you a classic example. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd is a person who did do something. He put in the NBN and he put in the NDIS. He will be remembered in the history books. I hate to say it, because I'm no fan of Malcolm Turnbull's, but he did put in Snowy 2.0, which is very, very important because we are moving more and more to intermittent power, which is extremely dangerous. To have something that we can fall back on is very important. Let me go to CopperString. Prime Minister Rudd announced the electrification of Australia, the connection of the outlying areas—the Ord iron ore industry, Olympic Dam and the North West Mineral Province, which I represent—to connect them to the national grid, which is an excellent thing to do. If you take cheap, competitively priced power in, later on you can take renewables—we hope cheaply priced—out. CopperString are in around their ninth year, now—the idea of building line from Townsville. Every single inch of line in Queensland was built by the government. Every single inch of railway line was built by the government. Now they build nothing. Here is a classic example. When I became minister for electricity in Queensland, I asked the head of the department whether Martin Tenni, my predecessor, had got that line into Normanton. He said, 'No.' I said I wanted it in the cabinet bag on Monday. You'd just do it. You'd say, 'Put it in the cabinet bag and call tenders.' For $274 million, I just said, 'We're going to call tenders for it,' and we did it. That's how hard it is. It took me 10 minutes of discussion with him and about two hours to review the cabinet submission and it was done, so we had a line from Cairns to Normanton. The line from Townsville to Mount Isa is not all that much longer, really. It's been nine years, and we've still made no progress on it. It's an area that is bringing $5,000 million a year into the Australian economy, and we can't build a lifeline to it, let alone talk about renewable energy such as ethanol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the longest serving senior cabinet ministers in the history of this place said to me that government in Australia no longer governs. He said that members of parliament cannot make a decision. They do not govern. It's a malaise of democracy. I never thought I'd see the day when China's growth would outstrip America's. We were brought up to believe the capitalist system and the free market—the competitive system—was vastly superior to centralised economies. That has been proved to be wrong, very badly wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think every person in Australia shakes their head whenever someone gets up and talks about building Australian made. All you had to do was give a contract for the government cars to Toyota, and you'd have an Australian car-building industry. But neither you nor you could do that. It wouldn't have cost the taxpayers a cent. That's how we got industry going in Queensland. If we wanted something to happen, we acted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about gas. The trade union that I belong to, the CFMMEU, God bless them, had a big sign up. We sold the gas for 6c a unit. You can buy it now for about $45 a unit. What country gives away one of its only three resources, one of its only three sources of income? Qatar, a little tiny country in the Middle East, produces the same amount of gas we do and exports the same amount of gas as we do, and Qatar get $29,000 million a year for their gas. We get $600 million for ours. That's wages—not that there is much wages involved. What sort of government do we have here in this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went into parliament, our stove was made in Australia, our fridge was made in Australia, our air conditioner was made in Australia. Every single household appliance was made in Australia. Now none of them are made in Australia. If you want to buy things from overseas, you've got to sell something. People in this place have never been in business, so they don't understand that concept. You've got have money coming in as well as money going out. We allowed five of our six great mining companies to be foreign owned. When the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government fell in Queensland—outside of the Theodore Labor governments in Queensland, easily the greatest government in Australian history—we owned BHP, we owned Mount Isa Mines, we owned Western Mining Corporation, we owned North and we owned Woodside. We didn't own Rio. Now foreigners own BHP, foreigners own Mount Isa Mines, foreigners own Rio, foreigners own Chevron, foreigners don't own Fortescue—God bless Twiggy—and they own Adani. So five of the six are foreign owned. What sort of a country lets its entire resources be foreign owned?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you people in this place—I have to say it to you and I say it bluntly: you are not Australians. No-one in Australia would have agreed to any of those things. No person who had any decency and considered himself a true Australian would have gone to any of those solutions. I could take you into a hotel or a shopping centre at any time of the day or night and ask people, 'What are the three things you'd most like to happen in this country if you were the boss of this country?' and, you know what, amongst the three every single time would be that we buy back and own our own country. That's what they'd say. But you don't listen to them because you've got all this grand ideology and you want to preach to them and tell them how you're wonderful and you're saving the planet. Well, excuse me for saying that they're not listening to you. That's why more than a third of Australia voted against you people and against you people in the last election. Wake up to yourselves and become Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Please God—and I pray every night to the good Jesus—we will get the balance of power in Queensland. We dipped out by two seats in the last election. We dipped out by 690 votes at the election before. We're holding our seats by 70 per cent, the four seats that we control in Queensland. When we get there, you will immediately see the launching of a rail line to the Galilee, to open up the Galilee. You can all preach and howl and cry, but are you going to tell 600 million people in India that they can't have power? According to <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span>, 600 million people in India don't have power. Are you, as a little European country, a little tiny pinprick country in the middle of Asia, going to tell India that they can't have any electricity? Are you going to put solar panels on their roofs? Well, most of them don't have roofs! It would be ridiculous to even consider that. As von Clausewitz said in his book, 'If goods don't cross borders then guns will.' If ever there was a truism in history it's that. Another truism in history is, 'People without land will look for a land without people.' You can whistle and point, in both cases, what country I'm thinking of in that context. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we open up the Galilee coal—I think it should be done on the basis that they put HELE plants in India. There's no reason why they shouldn't. They cut commissions clean in half, similarly with China. I also believe we should build a plant—and I pay great tribute to Mike Kelly, who was a senior minister in the Labor government in this place. When he came back from Israel he said, 'Algae is everywhere. Algae lives on CO2, water and sunlight.' I love the CO2 bit. But if you build a power station and feed that CO2 to algae, you'll make more money out of the algae then you'll make out of the electricity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we open up the Galilee, that will be part of the deal: 'We'll give you 2,000 megawatts of electricity. You're losing 8,000 and you're only putting 4,000 on, so I don't know what's going to happen in seven or eight years time. But we'll give you 2,000 megawatts and we'll give you zero emissions. We'll give you the cheapest electricity in the world, because we're making more money out of algae.' I must pay tribute to Minister Plibersek, because she knows the algae—she's one step ahead of me. I very seldom admit that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Build the Bradfield Scheme. There's 23 million hectares of land covered by a prickly tree that is destroying all flora and fauna and will continue to grow, year by year. If you want to arrest that, you'd better start getting off your backside and building the Bradfield Scheme. He wasn't exactly an idiot, Bradfield. He built the Sydney Harbour Bridge. He built the water supply for Sydney. He built the underground railway system that got the international prize for engineering that year. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  I am really excited about this National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022 because I am passionate about Australian industry, including manufacturing, and I know how important this opportunity is for my community of Chisholm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have two universities, we have medical technology and advanced manufacturing businesses, and incredible work is being done on renewable energy. I am proud of my community and the inventive, innovative ideas they bring not only to our suburbs but to the nation and the world. I am so very happy to be part of a government that is backing ideas, backing making things here, through the establishment of the National Reconstruction Fund. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something that really strikes me when I visit businesses and talk to people in my community is how excited everyone is about the National Reconstruction Fund. People are excited about it because they know it is good for our nation's future. My community wants a government that supports good, secure jobs and sovereign capability and has a vision and plan for what our country can look like as we rebuild after the very worst of the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We get one chance to rebuild our nation after the very worst parts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must seize it. It is, genuinely, really disappointing that those opposite lack the vision, imagination and conviction to support our country at this time by backing the National Reconstruction Fund. I wish that this could have been bipartisan, and I'm really baffled as to why the coalition won't support our communities. Then again, maybe that's my fault for being an optimist, given that their record shows nothing but contempt for the automotive manufacturing industry in this country, and there's been a terrible decline of manufacturing on their watch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our communities very quickly saw what happens to a country when there is no sovereign capability in manufacturing, when supply chains were disrupted through border closures during the earlier parts of the COVID pandemic. This was a moment for our country to reflect and to do what was needed, to make sure we could be resilient and self-sufficient. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This side of the House, the now Labor government, learnt those lessons and is implementing the change we need. Those opposite learnt nothing and now oppose the government doing something which will make our country stronger. We were elected on a mandate to drive the transformation of Australian industry and revive our ability to make world-class products in Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Since July last year, I have risen five times in this chamber to speak about the McGowan government's failure to address WA's hospital crisis. In the 7½ months since I first spoke, nothing has changed. Ambulance ramping continues to soar, nurses are still working double shifts to make up for staff shortages, and, still, Premier Mark McGowan is slow to listen and slow to act. In a damning report by the AMA, the Peel Health Campus was declared seventh-worst hospital on a list of hundreds across the nation. It found that across Western Australia less than one-quarter of patients at emergency departments were treated in the targeted 30 minutes. The Peel Health Campus fared even worse, with only one in five emergency patients treated on time. This is not a great surprise. Many people in Canning have shared with me their stories of Peel Health Campus and their accounts are appalling: stories of frail, elderly people seeking medical assistance and waiting hours and hours to be assessed; men and women left with bruising on their legs after sitting in hard plastic chairs in ED for hours and hours. Others shared their concerns about ambulance wait times and availability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most shocking experience is that of Vicky. Vicky called an ambulance after experiencing severe pain. Instead of an ambulance, two police officers arrived to tell her there was a shortage of ambulances and she would need to find her own way to hospital. Vicky desperately phoned family and friends in the early hours of the morning to ask somebody to take her to the hospital. In the meantime, two other police officers arrived to ensure the previous two police officers had shown up. That is right; four police officers arrived at Vicky's home but no ambulance. Another Canning resident who had been diagnosed with stage-4 cancer received a text from her doctor advising her that her blood tests were alarming and to head to the Peel Health Campus immediately for treatment. On arrival she was told there were eight ambulances ramped and she rushed instead to Fiona Stanley Hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence of Premier Mark McGowan's health crisis is right in front of him, and there is a real human cost to this. Last year the inquest into seven-year-old Aishwarya's death at Perth Children's Hospital laid bare stories of understaffing and nurses faced with impossible workloads. This should have sparked an overhaul of the health system, but our arrogant Premier is so out of touch that he refuses to take urgent action. My great fear is there will be another tragedy like Aishwarya's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week our office was contacted by Sally, who was desperately searching for a GP or hospital to treat her nine-year-old grandson Carter, whose fever had spiked to over 39 degrees. Sally and her daughter took Carter and waited at Peel Health Campus for over five hours before being told that little Carter was unlikely to be seen and they would be better off trying a GP. None of the local GP clinics contacted by Sally had the capacity to assess and treat Carter. It was only after contacting my team that Sally was able to make an appointment for Carter at a clinic nearly 25 kilometres away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for action is now, before it is too late. The people of the Peel region elected three Labor state members to represent them in 2021, and they remain silent. David Templeman, a longstanding and completely ineffective state cabinet minister, continues to ignore the health crisis. The people of Mandurah must be wondering: what is the use of having him at the cabinet table if he can't close for the people he serves? He is not a closer, and we deserve better. Meanwhile, where are Robyn Clark and Lisa Munday? Both promised to fight for the community yet refuse to acknowledge the hospital crisis staring them in the face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only WA Labor that has failed Canning. Last week the Prime Minister flew to WA to trumpet funding for urgent-care clinics across the state but not one for Canning where it is needed most. The truth is Labor has broken the trust of our community. Promise after promise to fix the Peel Health Campus has been made. The state government has been in government for almost six years, but the problems are only getting worse on Labor's watch. I know the terrible stories from my constituents are the tip of the iceberg. This is unacceptable, and the Prime Minister, the WA Premier and every Labor MP in my region know it. Labor promised not to leave anyone behind, but that is exactly what they have done in the Peel region.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I've enjoyed the last couple of months celebrating some momentous occasions with the local Chinese Australian community in my electorate of Chisholm. At the end of last year, we came together to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between Australia and China, which were, of course, established by Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who had the foresight to see that our relationship with one another would only grow more important over time—and indeed it has.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In January, I was able to celebrate the lunar new year—the Year of the Rabbit for our Chinese Australian community and the Year of the Cat for our Vietnamese community—with so many people in the electorate. It's been really wonderful to be able to get out and about again and celebrate in the way that we used to several years ago, given that over the last couple of years, for public health reasons, we haven't been able to come together. So it was marvellous to be able to see the community roar back to life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are just some of the events I attended. One was the Chinese Seniors Education and Skills Development Association lunar new year celebration in Glen Waverley. We were able to hold lunar new year mobile offices in the glen and in Box Hill. The Wenxin Community Art Academy's Spring Festival art exhibition in Mount Waverley was wonderful, featuring lots of people displaying artwork at an exhibition for the first time. I was especially pleased to be able to attend the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse lunar new year celebration in Box Hill with the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Giles. The Chinese Community Society of Victoria dinner was wonderful. The Monash Senior Chinese Volunteer Service Centre Lantern Festival celebration had me try my hand at making dumplings, which was a really lovely experience to share. I attended the Chinese Professionals Club of Australia celebration. Monash City Council held their own Lunar New Year celebration, and I was really pleased to be able to attend before having to catch the plane up to Canberra on Sunday. I also attended the Box Hill Hawks lunar new year dinner, which is a really exciting new event that sees the local football club come together with our wonderful Australian Chinese community and host a celebration. I'm looking forward to attending, when I return to Melbourne, the Chinese lunar new year gala dinner at the Box Hill Town Hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you probably can tell from the description of just some of the events I've recently attended, it has been an incredibly busy time of celebration. It's been a time when the community can come together with family, with friends and with people we may not have seen in these sorts of contexts for a couple of years now. I want to congratulate every single person who put these events on and volunteered so much of their time to make sure that every event that I attended—and, I'm sure, many others that were held in the community—was a great success. I thank the leadership from the Monash and Whitehorse councils and the Victorian state government for supporting many of these initiatives. Ours is a truly diverse, multicultural electorate, and it is always so wonderful to be welcomed into the events and celebrations of communities like the Chinese Australian community and to learn more about how different cultures come to Australia and make all of our lives so much richer. I hope that everyone has a wonderful Year of the Rabbit—or Year of the Cat, if that's what you celebrate—and that it is full of health, wealth, prosperity and good fortune.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've picked up a few new Mandarin phrases. I am learning, Speaker, so please be kind when listening to my pronunciation. Chun jie kuai le—happy new year—to my local Chinese Australian community and, indeed, to all of the Chinese Australians who have just celebrated the lunar new year. Thank you very much for always making me feel so welcome in your community events. I'll continue to support your work in the community, and I look forward to seeing you all again when I get back to Melbourne. Xiexie—thank you—Speaker.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise tonight to continue to consistently speak, over the time I've been here, on infrastructure needs in Western Sydney and north-west Sydney, in my electorate of Mitchell. It continues to be one of the fastest and most rapidly growing areas of our country. We have the choice of over 90,000 Australians who have moved into this electorate over the last decade. It's been essential to have a government in New South Wales that supports infrastructure growth and infrastructure provision and is able to fund and sustain the commitment to so many projects that have now become the norm in Sydney. For my colleagues from all over the rest of the country, I'd say to them that Sydney is finally starting to work after a decade of Liberal-National government, which has put the money into the infrastructure projects that have been missing in Sydney for so long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to say that the coalition government, on the weekend, announced a very important commitment to the Tallawong to St Marys Metro line—what I've dubbed the missing link between St Marys and Rouse Hill, in effect—that will complete Sydney's Metro network. Essentially and vitally, that will go to the Nancy-Bird Walton airport. Of course, the second airport for Sydney was the commitment of the previous coalition government federally, who had the vision, finally, to take the tough decision and make sure this airport finally went ahead, and it's going ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still to this day it bemuses me that I have federal Labor colleagues who oppose the airport, even today—the member for Chifley being one, the member for Macarthur being another, and the member for Macquarie; they are still opposing the airport. Even as industry minister, the member for Chifley might want to think: where is all this manufacturing he is talking about going to go? It's going to go at the airport site. The coalition government has landmarked an enormous amount of land for the provision of manufacturing, which is high-tech manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, close to the airport, exactly where you'll need it to move around goods and freight and services. Yet, for some reason, the member for Chifley, from a low-socioeconomic demographic electorate—different to my electorate—opposes one of the biggest job creators in Western Sydney, providing not just transport and other construction jobs but long-term, sustainable jobs in industry, in manufacturing. I don't understand, sometimes, how members can come in and oppose visionary, significant improvements to cities like a second airport, which are self-sustaining, job-providing infrastructure with surrounding and supportive sites, including serious defence manufacturing, and look their people in the eye and say, 'I'm against this.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to transform Western Sydney. It is transforming Western Sydney. The infrastructure the coalition government is putting in place will now be enhanced by the Tallawong to St Marys missing link. And I know other colleagues strongly support what we're doing. Indeed, we've had this bipartisan commitment to getting funding to get this missing link built. I call on Chris Minns and the Labor Party as well to match the coalition's announcement and commitment to fill this missing link. Why would we build a Metro network in Sydney in 2023 where we don't complete the link? We are simply too far down the pike to not do something so important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to praise the coalition state government and Premier Dom Perrottet for the announcement. I think it's going to be welcome in Western Sydney. It's certainly going to be welcome in my electorate, from Rouse Hill but going all through the electorates of Riverstone and Blacktown and, federally, Greenway, all the way to that airport. This is a very significant piece of infrastructure. It's very important to communities. It should be bipartisan. It's been the record of this government in New South Wales that they fund and provide infrastructure. There are so many projects that have been built. There are so many projects currently being completed. It isn't normal for a New South Wales government to be doing so many projects. They have set a new standard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do say to people to carefully examine their choice at the upcoming New South Wales election on infrastructure and the provision of the funding for it. We have seen the Labor Party in New South Wales criticising the privatisation of assets and making it an election issue. But, of course, poles and wires was an issue that Mike Baird took to the election; he won the election strongly and funded all of the infrastructure provision in Sydney and has provided for these great announcements that we're able to make today. We must be able to fund the announcements when we form governments. I think it is disingenuous for the Labor Party in New South Wales to oppose privatisation once that issue has been contested at an election and won by the public, and the infrastructure is being provided. This is the best infrastructure Sydney has seen in anyone's lifetime, and more of it than we have ever seen. Sydney is finally starting to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have time, I also want to also want to praise the commitment to the Rouse Hill Hospital. The new hospital includes InTouch care, urgent and emergency care, day surgery units, adult and paediatric short stays, ambulances, outpatient care, rehabilitation, lifestyle medicine services and a multistorey car park. It's a great investment in infrastructure from a government that understands it's all about the service delivery in New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Adelaide is home to Australia's biggest arts festival, the Adelaide Fringe, and it is about to start this Friday. It is unique in Australia. It takes place in around 350 venues, with 1,200-plus shows and over 6,000 artists. I am very honoured to have them housed in my electorate in the Park Lands. The annual box office at the Adelaide Fringe is more than $20 million a year, which is paid out to the artists and presenters. So it goes back to the arts community. Approximately 800,000 tickets are sold each year at the Adelaide Fringe. This year they are predicting to break the million mark. Around 2.5 million attendances are clocked, including the free events. The Adelaide Fringe also generates over 6,500 jobs and delivers $90 million, which has a massive impact on the South Australian economy. These are pretty impressive figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Adelaide Fringe is one of our festivals, we also have the Adelaide Festival and WOMADelaide at exactly the same time. So we have three major arts events taking place in Adelaide during the end of February and in March. This creates the biggest festival cluster in Australia, and it's about to start this week. It is the most wonderful time to be in Adelaide, and to anyone who hasn't been I encourage you all—my colleagues in this House and everyone else—to visit Adelaide during our festival season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These past years haven't been kind to the arts sector. Everyone understands the devastation and the impact of COVID and the impact that it had on the arts communities. So I am determined to do all I can to ensure that the arts and creative sectors recover and continue to thrive in South Australia and around the country. This is why I so welcomed, as did everyone on this side of the House, the Albanese government's new national cultural policy, <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span>. It sets the course for Australia's arts, entertainment and cultural sector for the next five years. <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive</span> will empower our talented artists and arts organisations to thrive and grow. It will unlock new opportunities. It will reach new audiences and tell even more stories in compelling new ways. It will bring drive, direction and vision back to this essential industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the centre of the policy is the establishment of Creative Australia as the government's new principal arts investment and advisory body. These reforms deliver what the sector and artists and creatives have told us was needed. It was a great consultation process that Minister Burke undertook. This sector is essential for our culture, for our economy and for who we are as Australians, developing our culture. But it's also essential for our wellbeing. Anyone who has been transformed by a concert, show, book or painting will know: the arts are good for the soul. So to all the creatives and artists I say: thank you for making our lives richer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adelaide Fringe opens this Friday, 17 February, the Adelaide Festival opens on 3 March and WOMADelaide is on from 10 to 13 March. So do yourselves a favour and get to Adelaide during festival season and continue supporting and valuing our amazing industry, our creative people, the best way you can. I know I will be doing so, and I know many of my colleagues will be visiting Adelaide for some of the festivals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is not just the arts where the fringe festival takes place in the Park Lands to see. We have Rundle Street, which is full of restaurants and so vibrant. It's wonderful to see it packed. There are some great restaurants, including Sosta Argentinian Kitchen steakhouse. It's a wonderful restaurant. For those on the other end of the scale, there is also Staazi's vegan street food up the road. So there is choice for everyone in Rundle Street. Come along, grab a show and see some of the wonderful talent that will be on display in terms of theatre, stand-up comedy and live acts. Grab yourself a meal and visit one of the wonderful bars, such as East End Cellars and Mother Vine, all in the east end in my electorate of Adelaide that I am very proud to be the member for. I am very proud to have such wonderful events in my electorate. As I said to all my colleagues: support the arts, attend the shows and help them out after what they've been through with COVID.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e5d" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise today to say how lucky we are to have such a hip prime minister. I've been contemplating just how lucky we are. I saw him at Woodford one year in a black T-shirt—lately in a white T-shirt—with his black jeans on and his hat on. Nothing wrong with wearing a hat! I think of how lucky we are that he's so hip. He also goes to the tennis. We're very lucky to see him there, swanning it with the top end of town—and good luck to him. We're incredibly lucky we've got a prime minister that can go to Woodford and also go to the tennis—and spend days at the tennis; he obviously has a great love of the tennis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I hear our Prime Minister is going to go to Mardi Gras. Isn't that great—we're so lucky! This guy is so hip! He's 60 going on 16. We're very lucky. I don't know how long he will spend at Mardi Gras—that's his business—but I do know that he only spent four hours in Alice Springs; I know that! There are some rather big issues in Alice Springs, and they continue on. If it's not Alice Springs, it's Garbutt, Townsville, Cairns, Moree, Dubbo—so many regional towns where the issue of law and order is paramount. I'm wondering if the Prime Minister might want to go back to Alice Springs, and maybe visit a few other towns and take this agenda under his belt because that's what's really important to people dealing with the crime issues and law and order issues of these regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another place I didn't see him. I searched, but I really didn't see him at Australia Day. There were no Australia Day ceremonies he seemed to grace. Apparently they're not hip enough! A lot of people in my electorate are very proud of Australia Day. Australia Day is a great day. We recognise the work, especially the civil sacrifice—not the military sacrifice but the civil sacrifice—of so many people who have done so much for this nation. We recognise that Australia is a country that was founded basically on our incredible Indigenous heritage but also on the legacy of people who started as a penal colony—not as an invading army but as a penal colony. We have done so well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now we move forward, and apparently the Prime Minister of Woodford, the Prime Minister of the tennis and the Prime Minister of Mardi Gras wants to bring forward constitutional change that will have huge ramifications for how this nation works into the future, for how the operating manual of our country operates. There are real concerns that have been raised over and over again around why we would be discriminating against people and their access to this great article of democracy, why we would discriminate on the premise of their DNA whether they have access or not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently the world is going through very tenuous times. Tonight we are hearing about the fourth balloon being shot down over North America—over Alaska, Canada twice and South Carolina. I don't know whether that calls for someone who is hip or for someone who is totally and utterly focused on what is before us. It would probably be better for the people at Woodford or at the tennis or at Mardi Gras to have someone that they know is focused totally and utterly on the defence of this nation—</span>

                  </a>  I think it would be best that our nation reflect on what is before us at the moment. It is very sobering to turn on the news tonight and find out that, over the Great Lakes, yet another balloon has been shot down. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that we make this nation as strong as possible as quickly as possible. It is not the time for flirtations with peripheral issues, with issues that might be important but are not central to what this nation needs to sustain itself into the future of what is becoming, more and more and more, a very tenuous world. I hope that as we go forward we focus on making sure that power is as cheap as possible as quickly as possible. I hope we have a sobering and more informed view on such things as nuclear power. And I hope that the Prime Minister, on attending the Mardi Gras, reflects on the other things that are important to this nation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It's my favourite time of year again—it's showtime! Ag showtime, that is. Over the last few weeks I have had the absolute pressure of attending some of the wonderful agricultural shows that the New South Wales South Coast has to offer. As well as being a fun day out, which they absolutely are, these shows instil a sense of pride and cohesion in our region. Sadly, over the last few years many of our local shows have had to be cancelled due to COVID—necessary, but a real shame because these shows are so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023 I am delighted to say that our shows have come back in force, and if you haven't been to a show on the South Coast—well, you're missing out. So far this year I have been to the Eurobodalla Agricultural Show, the Kiama Show, the Berry Show and the Nowra Show. Each individual show has its own unique character. There are veteran livestock exhibitors with generations of experience, hobby farmers showcasing their skills, and essential service workers like the RFS, police and paramedics showing the community what they do best. Bakers of all levels proudly display cakes and treats in the pavilion. Flowers of every colour, shape and size are arranged by careful hands. Next to that you'll find any number of magnificent woven, crocheted and knitted items. The technique and patience you need to make some of these things are an absolute feat. That's not even half of it. I could speak all day about the displays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it isn't just what is on display; it's the faces behind the displays. The stalls at these shows are generally run by volunteer organisations such as the Rural Fire Service, the Rotary Club, the CWA and the Lions Club. And without the mammoth effort of the show society members and volunteers, and local organisations, these shows would not be able to operate. This in itself is a testament to the South Coast community. These shows are so important for families and students in our region. This is plain to see as soon as you walk through the gates. I grew up on a dairy farm just outside of Nowra, and I can tell you right now that the importance of being able to proudly display what you produce cannot be underestimated. Local farmers, students and individuals can spend all year putting their exhibits and entries together. It takes time and it's a real sense of pride and achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local people have been doing this for over a century. This year was the 135th year of the Berry Show. There was horse riding, woodchopping, dairy and beef cattle, poultry, and goats—you name it and they had it. It may have been their 135th year, but it was spectacular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kiama Show is held on a cliff overlooking the ocean, a true showcase of Kiama's beauty. Every year I proudly sponsor the farmyard nursery, and what a joy it is to see children's faces light up as they get to pat a little goat, cradle a bunny rabbit or hold a tiny piglet. I spent several hours on the show gates on a Saturday morning, and boy, was it busy! It was so great to see so many local people getting involved and helping me to up my wrist-banding skills.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Eurobodalla Agricultural Show operates from the Moruya Showground. This year I was particularly proud to open their brand-new kitchen, thanks to a $40,000 bushfire recovery grant. As many already know, the Moruya Showground was used as an evacuation centre during the bushfires. I was absolutely delighted to help them get fit-for-purpose kitchen facilities to make sure local people are better prepared for the next disaster.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this weekend was the Nowra Show, where young people and people of all ages show dairy cattle. I met with the Nowra High School senior support class and they were proudly checking out all their prized entries in the pavilion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely thank all of our show societies and their members, volunteers, organisations, and local farmers for all of their work making our local shows the amazing community celebrations they are. If you didn't get to make it to any of these shows, never fear, because we have two more yet to come. I simply cannot wait for the Kangaroo Valley Show this Friday and Saturday, and Milton on 3 and 4 March. Why not plan a trip to a show on the South Coast over the next few weeks? I guarantee you will not regret it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Today I speak to voice the concerns of many of my constituents about the imminent threat to Trove, an extraordinary information service provided by the National Library of Australia. Trove is a remarkable resource. It contains about six billion digital items: books, journals, maps, archives, digitised newspapers and magazines, photographs, web archives, parliamentary papers, reports, theses and more. All are available at no charge to users. The site is accessed 63,000 times every day. That's 22 million visits every year. There are almost 1,000 organisations contributing to trove. It's an extraordinary service and one which has become an essential part of many people's lives. I'd like to share some of the correspondence I've received from constituents from Kooyong about the importance of Trove to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mrs Sandra Torpey, of Hawthorn, writes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The first of my family to settle in Australia arrived in Tasmania in 1836. Many more came by sea in the following years. They weren't distinguished people but their arrivals can all be found in Trove. As can their births, engagements, marriages and deaths. Their small honours and rewards, serving their country in its wars and more besides. We cherish their stories which would be lost without Trove.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Associate Professor Chris Wright, of Camberwell, an intensive care specialist and Academic Director of Clinical Programs for the Monash University medical course, has also written in, urging me to push for the restoration of funding for Trove and, more broadly, for support of that wonderful institution that is the National Library of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from Elizabeth Yewers, President of the Hawthorn Historical Society, who emphasised that Trove has democratised knowledge. It's brought important historical resources to Australians who can't otherwise access them at public institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Melbourne Tram Museum, a volunteer led group in Hawthorn, shared how invaluable Trove is for supporting their exhibitions and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Failure to provide ongoing funding for the Trove service will have a serious impact on our museum's ability to inform the public and support ongoing research on tramway history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The defunding of Trove will lead to vastly diminished public access to nationally significant collections. It will also remove access to records that are significant because of the history that they preserve and the memories that they protect. To quote Ray Bradbury: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of all of the constituents of Kooyong and the wider national communities of Trove users, I call on the government to step up and provide the National Library of Australia with the funding it needs to ensure the preservation of this essential service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  A few short weeks ago, some local Sunbury champions were awarded Medals of the Order of Australia. Marianne and Neil Williams started the Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen 10 years ago. Initially a small operation which used the leftover food from their catering business, the Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen quickly grew. Every Monday, Marianne, Neil and their incredible team of over 45 volunteers open their kitchen at the Sunbury Memorial Hall to provide over 220 meals to those in our community who are doing it tough. Like many, Marianne and Neil's catering business faced challenges throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their commitment and dedication to the Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen never wavered. In December I had the honour of attending their annual presentation evening to acknowledge the amazing contribution that this organisation and its volunteers make to our community. I am so deeply thankful to Marianne and Neil and their entire team for the work they do. I cannot think of more deserving people for such an award. I look forward to catching up with them and the team at a Monday night cook up very soon.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's announcement that the Albanese government will expand NBN full-fibre upgrades is a game changer for many in our community. From my home town in the westernmost part of my electorate of Hawke, in Ballan, right across to Sunbury, thousands of homes and businesses will be getting this upgrade. This complements similar works already announced and underway in parts of Melton and Melton South and right across our region. We know that with many more people working and studying from home the pain of slow and inconsistent internet is felt by so many. I myself have been the victim of this, with at times agonisingly slow internet speeds. Trying to do meetings online with three kids yelling in the background and a dodgy internet connection is pretty challenging. So I'll be keenly following this one to make sure we can make the most of the full-fibre upgrade at home with fast speeds and better connectivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently contacted by Andrew from Sunbury, who asked when his premises would be upgraded. I'll be very pleased to share this news with Andrew and so many others in the community who have been waiting for so long. We know that the rollout of the NBN was bungled by the previous government. They sat on their hands and didn't invest in the high-speed internet that we need for our communities and for our economy. If we want to keep Australia more connected and competitive we need high-speed internet. This Labor government has invested $2.4 billion for the expansion of NBN full-fibre upgrades to 1.5 million Australian premises, including over 660,000 in regional communities. I know that locals in Hawke will be thrilled to hear this news today and I can't wait to see it get rolled out.</span>

Significantly, this Australia Day we came together in Mandurah to recognise and welcome our new Australians taking the pledge of allegiance to a wonderful country. I had the pleasure of welcoming 80 new citizens from a wide range of backgrounds and nationalities, and it was a delight to, all of us together, sing our national anthem at the conclusion. The ceremony also gave me and many others the opportunity to renew our pledge to Australia. It was a reminder for all of us, whether we were born here or were naturalised after birth, that we owe this country our unwavering allegiance.</span>

I was delighted to see, among the long list of Australians honoured in the 2023 Australia Day honours, Canning residents Lynn Rodgers OAM and John Lawrence OAM recognised for their longstanding service and dedication to our community. Mandurah Primary School Principal Natasha Upcott was awarded the City of Mandurah Community Citizen of the Year. Natasha has taught there for nearly 20 years and has been an industrious and tireless advocate for women's and children's issues, children's education and road safety. Sixteen-year-old Baylee Freitag received the Youth City of Mandurah Community Citizen of the Year Award.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I rise today in this chamber to acknowledge the 15th anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations delivered in Parliament House by former prime minister the Hon. Dr Kevin Rudd in 2008. This moment in our country's history was a significant occasion for First Nations people, and overall it was an important step in our nation's path to reconciliation. I am honoured to be in this place, as a proud Wiradjuri man living on Darkinjung country, acknowledging the impact this had on First Nations people and the importance that this apology had for truth-telling about shameful policies of past governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget the moment, as a young teenager in high school, watching Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver the apology. Finally, after years, after decades, a federal government was acknowledging the destructive effects that these policies had, and that they continue to have, on our First Nations people throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I was joined by none other than my grandmother Aunty Robyn Reid, a Wiradjuri elder living on Darkinjung country on the New South Wales Central Coast. My grandmother personally met Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today. She got to thank him for his powerful apology 15 years ago, and to tell him how this continues to resonate with our family and for our community. Nan was also very proud to shake Kevin Rudd's hand today, and he was very, very lucky to get that hand back! It was a very big moment for her today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we remember and continue to work towards closing the gap for our First Nations people and our First Nations communities so that together we move forward as a strong and united nation. Australia will be presented with a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the upcoming referendum to recognise our First Nations brothers and sisters in our Constitution and to give First Nations people a voice to parliament. And today, in this chamber, I ask all Australians from all walks of life to vote yes; to vote yes to support the next step in the path for reconciliation, for respect and for unity. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  A couple of weeks ago it was my birthday. As a special treat we caught the train from Moree to Willow Tree. I had lunch at the Willow Tree Inn with my family and then caught the train back again. Why that's significant for this chamber is that the first 100 kilometres of that trip was on the newly completed Inland Rail section from Moree back to Narrabri—a remarkable achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shared the track on that day with grain trains and, the closer we got below Narrabri, coal trains as well. It's a vital piece of infrastructure, and I just want to give credit to the people who worked on that section during floods and high rainfall. Trying to deal with black soil and mud is not much fun for engineers, but during the flood it was the only thing above the water on that section, and so it will be a flood-free route.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are dangers we need to be careful of, and I know Minister King is waiting for Kerry Schott's report on inland rail. It was instigated after the election. I'm also looking forward to seeing that as I am concerned that these projects that are worthwhile are not easy. It's a lot easier to stop something than to start it, and so we need to push through. I've had considerable criticism for my support of this project, but ultimately—with regard to reducing our emissions, with regard to freight efficiency, with regard to greater access for my electorate to the capital cities around Australia—it will be a great project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to understand that the business case is to build an intermodal track between Melbourne and Brisbane. That will be 85 per cent of the freight. I'm supportive because it will also give access to more ports for the grain that's produced my electorate. Also, with the upgrade that was funded under the previous government, the Port of Newcastle will connect to the inland rail. So it will become much more important for grain in your electorate, Deputy Speaker. It's the obvious choice for exporting grain out of New South Wales and, I would think, ultimately, for southern Queensland—that will be out of the Port of Newcastle. My hope is that the Schott report does not put a kibosh on this project and that the current government and Minister King keep their commitment to it, because ultimately it will be a game changer for the eastern states of Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, Danielle Brice tragically lost her youngest son, Chris, in a pedestrian accident on South Head Road in Moruya. Chris died six weeks before his 18th birthday while walking to a party, and it simply should not have happened. Since then, his mum has campaigned strongly for improvements to South Head Road. Her efforts with the Moruya South Head Cycle/Pathway Committee saw the off-road shared pathway get off the ground, and now there is less than two kilometres left to complete. It's something they should be incredibly proud of. But here is the sticking point, because what doesn't a community which has spent two decades fighting to improve local infrastructure to protect the lives of local people need? They don't need broken promises and political stunts. But, sadly, that seems to be all the New South Wales Liberals know how to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mere days before the Bega by-election last year, the New South Wales Liberal Minister for Active Transport visited Moruya with two local Liberal candidates—one of whom was the former member—to announce with some fanfare that the Eurobodalla Shire Council would submit an application to fund this $2.5 million missing pathway link. The former member for Bega said, 'Rob will steer it over the next few weeks'. The minister himself said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… I'm confident, provided this project meets the parameters of the program, which I'm sure it will, it's exactly the sort of project that should be funded.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, I'm the guy who will make the decision on the funding … having seen it you'd be foolish to not realise how important this project is to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who could blame the Moruya community for thinking the project was in the bag? But hold on, there was a slight slip in the Liberals' plans. They lost the seat of Bega to Labor's fabulous Dr Michael Holland, and, uh-oh, they lost the seat of Gilmore too. Whoops, that wasn't in the plan! So what did they decide to do? That project that the minister said would be 'foolish' to miss out on, missed out. There was no explanation and no fanfare, just an unsuccessful application and questions from the community left unanswered. It's simply flabbergasting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister must explain why he put politics above the safety of the Moruya community and deliver on his promise to local people now. The people of the South Coast deserve better than self-interested, self-serving political stunts. They deserve better than pork barrelling 101, but, sadly, this is all you'll ever get from a Liberal government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I rise today to update the House on the progress of the Canberra Forum, which is my Australian-first deliberative panel, which is being run by democracyCo. Emma Fletcher and Emily Jenke from democracyCo have very generously volunteered their expertise in running this deliberative process. This is a process by which randomly selected Canberrans—40 people—will participate over six months in choosing topics and coming up with recommendations on those topics, which I have committed to use in guiding my own advocacy in this place, to raise with ministers in our caucus and to publish in full on my website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend we had our first working meeting, in which we began the process of choosing the topics. I must say this was, frankly, a heartwarming experience, to see 40 randomly selected Canberrans, who'd only really met each other once before at our meet and great meeting late last year, work together all afternoon in such an engaged and respectful way, to be really committed to choosing these topics, choosing the things they felt mattered most to Canberra—not just to Canberra, but to Australia and to our world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The three topics at the moment, which will be further defined, are, of course, around climate change and the transition to a renewable economy, around social justice and the equitable access to services for all and also around community voices being heard in the parliament. Through hearing from experts and further refining these issues, we will pin down the topics, which we will then work towards the recommendations of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say again how proud I am to represent a community where these are the sorts of topics they turn their minds to. At the end of that session last weekend, we had an exercise where people talked about their experience of the afternoon, and it was very heartening to hear people say that they felt they had been heard, that they really appreciated the opportunity to work with their fellow Canberrans and that it was a respectful and positive experience. Again, I want to thank Emma Fletcher and Emily Jenke from democracyCo, who came up from Adelaide to run that session and will do for further sessions as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next steps are to hear from experts as we refine those topics, and then we'll have further meetings over the next six months. I also want to acknowledge the Canberra Alliance for Participatory Democracy, a citizen group who help organise observers for the event and will be evaluating it. I'm really looking forward to the next steps of this process. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  On the weekend, the Clubhouse Moorooka celebrated its first anniversary. Happy birthday, and a big thank you. Of course, the clubhouse is the old Moorooka Bowls Club, which had to close its doors back in May 2019 after half a century of entertaining fans, providing a social place for the community and training elite players—and even hosting the Commonwealth Games lawn bowls back in 1982. Locals are still very proud of this moment in the sun and will point to the plaque on the wall commemorating the visit by the late, great Queen Elizabeth II during the Commonwealth Games when they were held in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition from battling bowls club to community hub wasn't easy; it did take a while for the clubhouse to become operational. Originally, the Brisbane City Council had made an agreement with the new lessee for the club, a not-for-profit group which was keen to open the facilities up to local groups and residents. It takes a lot to get a club up and running and to turn it into a viable, active community hub but, unfortunately, the LNP led Brisbane City Council refused to take responsibility for handing over the facility in anything like an adequate condition, although they were quite willing to fund the refurbishment of a similar old bowls club in a neighbouring LNP ward. Funny, that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the clubhouse, run mainly by volunteers, has had to find the funds to continue to renovate and upgrade. But the band of workers at the clubhouse have done some great work. For years we watched the clientele of the Moorooka Bowls Club dwindle, but no more. The once well-manicured lawns were devoid of players, as the interest in bowls diminished—boomers just don't bowl in the numbers that are needed to keep these clubs alive. Consequently, the once-proud facilities became a little run down and, as the years rolled on, locals wondered what would become of the venue. The team at the clubhouse have turned it into a wonderful warm hub that our local community well and truly loves. There's good coffee from fairly early and then plenty of choices later in the day if you need something a bit stronger. The clubhouse hosts movie nights, bands, activities for children and, every now and then, a theme night which may include wigs, rollerskates and a bit of dancing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each morning the coffee kiosk, Bean on the Green, opens up to serve locals with a brew of their favourite hot drink and some pastries, and then the ice cream has been a bit of a hit as the warm weather has taken over in Brisbane lately. Parents can enjoy their morning coffee while children can make the most of the fully-fenced facility. And I do see some dogs running around there early in the morning. On Friday evenings people flock to the clubhouse to unwind; the relaxing atmosphere and the warm summer sunsets are a great way to end the week. The old bowling greens are now full of families catching up with friends and neighbours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 12 months, the former Moorooka Bowls Club has truly transformed into the clubhouse. Not long after it opened its doors, the clubhouse brought in people who had damage during the flood and did great work to look after those people. And whilst the Moorooka Bowls Club served as a hub for our community in a very different area, the clubhouse is the perfect venue for a vibrant, modern, and welcoming community.</span>

Dungog Shire Council's Gwen Rumble was named Young Citizen of the Year for showing outstanding leadership in her community. She had received the New South Wales Premier's Anzac Memorial Scholarship 2022 and for volunteering in the National Youth Ambassador program. Georgia McDonald received Junior Sports Award for representing Glen William Public School in zone athletics, swimming and touch football. She also competed in the New South Wales state age championships.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lachlan Richardson of Gresford received the Senior Sports Award for his efforts as one of Australia's best rodeo riders, placing second in the PVR Australia grand finals. He ended the 2022 season in the top three of the national rankings. Lachlan is really inspiring many other to go into the sport. William Dowling of Bandon Grove received the Environmental Citizen of the Year award for his efforts in several projects in state forests in the Barrington Tops State Conservation Area and working through the Dungog Commons.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pauline Cambourne and Susan Dillon are also doing great things in the Dungog Shire. They received the Volunteer Service to the Community Award for their efforts at the Dungog growers stall and as secretary of the successful Dungog Tea Party—which I can say from my own personal experience is an amazing success. Hundreds of people come to Dungog to look at the amazing collection of teapots. Susan has also put in a huge effort for the Paterson River Pony Club for more than twenty years and manages the Gresford canteen. </span>

His achievements include out-of-hours youth bands HATCH and HATCHlings, creating the Big Band Blast in 2013 with Jazz musician John Morrison and giving 17 years of his time to volunteering with the Wauchope-Bonny Hills Surf Life Saving Club. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge and thank members of my community who received Australia Day awards in the Clarence Valley.

Meghanne Wellard was awarded a Public Service Medal for astounding public service in the recovery of the Department of Education's Rural North community following the flood crisis.

Young Citizen of the Year went to Nicole Cowling for her commitment in helping a number of community organisations, such as helping to organise the Highland Gathering dance section and assisting young women entrants. Peter Martin received the Local Hero Award. Peter devotes many hours to croquet, such as mowing lawns, weeding, organising working bees and such. The 24 Grafton Army Cadet Unit was awarded the Community Achievement Award for helping at many different community events—dragon boat events and the Jacaranda Festival to name a few. Thank you and congratulations to all those winners. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge members of my community who received Australia Day awards in the Richmond Valley. The Citizen of the Year award went to Mark O'Toole for his courage and selfless acts during the 2022 flooding natural disaster. He also secured donations for the region and distributed them. Iris Hobbins received the Young Citizen of the Year award. A young member of the Evans Head Casino Surf Club, she is a natural leader and a mentor to other young girls.

Chantelle Davis was the Young Volunteer of the Year for her commitment to the community in the 2019-20 fires and the 2022 floods, protecting and saving lives. Joseph Mohammed is the Sportsperson of the Year for outstanding performance in rugby union at both club and representative levels over many years with the Casino Bulls Rugby Union Club, and he has coached many teams.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge and congratulate members of my community who were recognised at the Kyogle Australia Day Awards recently. Pamela Campbell was awarded an OAM for service to the community of Kyogle. The Citizen of the Year award went to Lyndelle Saville. She has contributed to various community clubs over many years, and was the first female member and secretary, for five years, of the gun club. The Senior Citizen of Year is Peter Constable, who has served in executive roles in many community organisations, dating back to the 1960s. Junior Sportsperson of the Year went to Brayden Howlett, who has represented Kyogle in junior state and national golf competitions. He's been a caddy kid at the Australian PGA for some of the world's top ranking golf professionals.

The Young Citizen of the Year went to Oliver McCormick, who was an outstanding role model for students as School Captain at Kyogle High School. Congratulations to all those worthy recipients.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  Thanks, Deputy Speaker, and I'd like to congratulate you for being selected to join the Speaker's panel.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join other members this morning in acknowledging that the Order of Australia is the highest national honour awarded to Australian citizens for their astounding contribution to our nation. Of course, there is a military division in the Order of Australia as well. Since the order was established by Her Majesty the late Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, there have been 40,000 recipients of awards in the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be a member of the Order, receiving the Order of Australia medal on Australia Day 2006 for volunteer work for Timor-Leste. It was very humbling, and I continue to work for our nation in a variety of roles to honour membership of the Order and to serve Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we celebrate the 1,047 Australia Day 2023 award recipients. I congratulate all of those recipients, and I'd particularly like to acknowledge all Australians who were nominated and awarded. One of those recipients is Timmy Duggan, who launched Hoops 4 Health in 2002. For over 20 years Timmy has been assisting young Territorians and other young Australians, and he's used basketball as a vehicle for connection and change. Timmy is also the first National Basketball League, NBL, player from the NT. He has used his passion for sports to build resilience in our young kids, including at our youth detention centre in Darwin, the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. In fact, it was Timmy who first invited me to join him to go into Don Dale to spend time with young Territory kids, and he has done powerful work to help them get on the right track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the remarkable story of Maureen Langdon, who was recognised for her services to nursing. Maureen was the first full-time female ambulance officer in Australia. She worked in the Territory for 48 years, including for the Northern Territory St John Ambulance service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to congratulate my friend Henry Gray for his services to education, which included teaching in Groote Eylandt, Nhulunbuy and Darwin. Henry said to me that he gave up a possible inheritance of a family farm to enter teachers college, and he was a mature age student in 1968. He found educating young Australians and young Territorians to be such a fulfilling career. Let me say to you, Henry, that you acquitted your responsibilities with integrity. You made such a difference to those that you educated, and you kept a smile on your heart. Well done, mate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Berverley McCormack for her services to remote nursing in Central Australia, since 2006, as well as Dr Sadhana Mahajani who helped establish Darwin's first community health centre, in 1974, and kept on working out of a demountable after Cyclone Tracy ripped through our city. I heard her interviewed on radio recently. It was a truly inspiring story. Another Territorian to receive the Order of Australia is Superintendent Peter Malley, who worked in NT Police, including in Darwin, and currently in Palmerston, for 20 years. Pete has also been recognised for his service with an Australian Police Medal. Well done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to pay tribute to Sue McCallum for her amazing service to veterans over decades. Sue was posted, in Darwin, as a radio operator in the Navy. She comes from a family of veterans, across the generations, and she's been spending her time, over the last decades, helping veterans to navigate the compensation system with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. She has been volunteering for Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia NT, Veterans Australia NT and Mates4mates. Sue said she was overwhelmed to receive an Order of Australia. She felt like she had not done so much, and that's so true of many humble people receiving these awards. But, as a long-term member of Veterans Australia NT, I know how much you have done, Sue. Well done. It's truly important and selfless work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the valuable work of the NT committee for the order and encourage people to nominate exceptional Australians. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Payne, and I offer my hearty congratulations on your appointment as well. I rise today to support the motion, by the member for Page, which highlights the great work of those people who have received awards this Australia Day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Day is a day we come together to celebrate our great nation and all that it has to offer, whether it's going to the beach to play cricket or gathering with family and friends for a barbie. It's also a day that highlights the great work given from people from our communities and awards them with recognition. Around our nation, many community champions received Australia Day awards. In my electorate of Dawson, there are more than 40 I would like to acknowledge in this place. I would like to take the opportunity to give a shout-out to these amazing people who put so much of themselves and their time into our communities. I think it only appropriate to see them recognised for their efforts. As it is in most areas, these awards range from volunteer acknowledgements, environmental awards, sporting achievers, citizens of the year and the prestigious Order of Australia medal. However, they all acknowledge one thing: how dedicated and selfless our people are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Mackay, there are seven people who received awards: Sergeant Nigel Dalton, Citizen of the Year, Keira Brown, Jody Burrows, Alison Richardson, Brenda Windsor, Connor Parish, Dr Judith Wake and the Pioneer Valley Machinery Preservationists Society. These people are all heavily involved in the Mackay community, in a major way, through sporting groups, not-for-profit organisations and so much more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Burdekin, the recipients were Gerald Henaway, Zavier Wood, Brent Dingle, Kate Casswell, Ricky Gudge, Margaret Taylor, Desley Musumeci, Joan Andersen, Michelle Darker, Flo Downing, Maureen Perry, Judy Peterson, Beth Wall, Keith Kiloh, Aileen Jones, Eliza Worlein, Jarrod Langford, Makayla Pirrone, Kiera Wiseman, Ellyana Mugica and the committee of the Burdekin Race Club. The Burdekin is truly a better place with these ladies and gents around. The dedication and drive they have for their region is something they should all be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Whitsundays, the awardees showcased were Marlene Reiffel, Lisa Stanley, Graham Smith, Mac Rogers, Anne-Marie Kehres, Kids at the Beach Childcare Centre and the Bowen Neighbourhood Centre. There are so many opportunities to get involved in the Whitsundays and these recipients truly took it upon themselves to get in amongst what the region has to offer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville, the northern part of my electorate, awardees acknowledged were Peter Shefford, Kobe Chun-Tie, Darren Randall, Allan Jefferson, Maree McClelland, Zoe Chester and Dr Adam Smith. The Townsville region is a beautiful part of Queensland, and these seven recipients have truly made the most of their tropical city. I was lucky and honoured to be able to travel around the electorate on Australia Day to witness some of these recipients receiving their awards. A huge congratulations to all Australia Day award recipients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make mention of the hundreds of residents around my region who were nominated for an Australia Day Award. As we all know, there can be only a certain number of people who win the award, but all these nominees put in hours of their time, sacrificing their time and energy for the betterment of our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one last person I'd like to acknowledge—Mr Ronald Bassan OAM. Ronald signed up for the military when he was 17. He was an artilleryman from 1954 to 1975. Ronald was recently awarded an Order of Australia Medal for his distinguished military service and the contribution to Mackay's community as a civilian. He has been loyal to our nation his entire life. He celebrated his 21st birthday in a Malaysian jungle camp while deployed. What a trooper! Mr Bassan, a local legend up my way, deserves every accolade he receives. Thank you for your service and congratulations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout 2023 I'm excited to see even more community events starting up or returning after COVID, and more locals getting involved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  We'll make it a trifecta as I too congratulate Deputy Speaker Payne on her elevation—much deserved—to the speaker's panel. I thank the member for Page for moving this motion, and I join him in celebrating the 1,000 or so Australia Day 2023 awards recipients, including 736 awards in the general division of the Order of Australia for meritorious, distinguished and conspicuous service. In particular, I acknowledge Order of Australia recipients for 2023 from my own electorate of Lyons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer my sincere congratulations to the very Hon. Margaret Reynolds AC. Margaret was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia for eminent service to the people and parliament of Australia, to social justice, gender equality and Indigenous rights, to local government, and to the community. I know Margaret well; she lives in Richmond in my electorate. Despite having been a senator for Queensland for some years, she has moved to the beautiful isle. This award is truly well-deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret served in the Senate for Queensland from 1983 to 1999. She was Local Government Minister from 1987 to 1990 and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women from 1988 until 1990. Margaret's achievements during her distinguished career as an activist, educator, and author are also too numerous to mention, but I will single one out. For six years she led the Friends of the ABC from her home just outside of Hobart in Tasmania and did a wonderful job representing that fantastic organisation and its importance to this nation. To this day, Margaret and her wonderful husband, Henry, are very active members of the local community in Richmond as well as nationally. Suffice to say, I am thrilled that Margaret Reynolds has been recognised for what continues to be a lifetime's work as an activist and advocate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recognise Mr Roger Self OAM, awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community of the Tasman Peninsula. Roger is a stalwart of this wonderful community, serving on the Tasman Council for more than a decade, including as mayor from 2005 until 2007. He was and continues to be active in several community organisations, including the Rotary Club of Tasman Peninsula, the Tasman Lions Club, and the Eaglehawk Neck Action Community Taskforce. I can tell you that the Eaglehawk Neck Action Community Taskforce is a small but very active group doing really important work for that part of my electorate. Roger, I take this opportunity to thank you for your service to community and congratulate you on this well-deserved recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take a moment to congratulate recipients of Australia Day awards awarded by local councils across Lyons last month. I've set it in this place before and I'll say it again: the people of Lyons are talented, hardworking and committed to their local communities. Once again, there are far too many achievements to mention them all, but I'll try to get through as many as I can—and I've got 12 councils in my electorate. Congratulations to Glamorgan Spring Bay Council Citizen of the Year Helen Gamble, Break O'Day Council Citizen of the Year Diane Harris, Central Highlands Council Citizen of the Year Ron Sonners, Derwent Valley Citizen of the year Justin Benson, Kentish Council Citizens of the Year Kentish Doug and Lesley Begg, Northern Midlands Council Citizen of the Year Maureen Shadbolt—I had the great pleasure of spending some of the day with Maureen—Southern Midlands Council Citizen of the Year Tony Collis, Meander Valley Council Citizen of the Year Iain Mackenzie, Sorrell Council Citizens of the Year Jessica Ffrost-Boyd and Craig Boyd, and Tasman Council Citizen of the Year Arnold McShane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brighton Council will announce its citizen of the year at a ceremony in February, having elected to have its awards later in the year, as is absolutely its right to do, and Clarence City Council, I understand, doesn't have such awards and is reconsidering whether to have such awards at all. Of course, this is a big thing in a free country like Australia. Councils are now free to make their own decisions about how to hold their citizenship awards. I think that's only opportune and right in a free country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulation every nominee and award recipient. I congratulate everybody involved and thank them for their service to their community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Deputy Speaker Payne, I'm so pleased to see you sitting in the chair. I am very glad to have this opportunity to acknowledge some of the community servants in our community. These are the people who have received Australia Day Order of Australia awards and Citizen of the Year awards from the Frankston City Council and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had five people in my local community honoured in the Order of Australia general civilian division this year. For significant service to tertiary medical education, Emeritus Professor Paul McMenamin of Mount Eliza was awarded the Member of the Order of Australia. Professor McMenamin has been emeritus professor of anatomy and development biology at Monash University since 2020, and his service to tertiary medical education means that he is a very worthy recipient of this honour. For distinguished service to medical research in the field of haematology, to tertiary education and to the promotion of science, Professor Michael Berndt of Mount Eliza has been awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia. He has been a John Curtin Distinguished Emeritus Professor since 2018. We in our community know, as do people across Australia—more so perhaps than anyone realised before 2020—how important it is to have people like Professor McMenamin and Professor Berndt, who promote science, who serve tertiary education to educate our future scientists and who work in areas where medicine and medical research save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For service to the community through a range of organisations, Mrs Jean Gilbert of Mount Eliza was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Mrs Gilbert has volunteered with Toorak College, St James the Less Anglican Church in Mount Eliza, the Peninsula Home Hospice Women of Action biennial luncheon and many more. She is such a stalwart of the community. For service to veterans, Mr Kevin Hunter of Frankston was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. He has been on the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia's Victorian branch as a state welfare director for 25 ongoing years. As a patron of the Frankston branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, I thank him and everyone else for the work that they do. He has made many veteran welfare contributions and served in the Army and Army Reserves for almost 30 years, receiving recognition for his service in Vietnam with several medals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For service to the community, particularly through the church, Mr Ricky Painter of Langwarrin received a Medal of the Order of Australia. He is a senior pastor at Gateway Church Australia and a co-producer of the Good Friday Family Festival, a terrific festival that occurs on the Frankston foreshore. I'm very proud of our two police officers who received a meritorious award: Commander Martin O'Bryan, for 42 years with the Victoria Police, and Detective Leading Senior Constable Paul Roberts, who has served 37 years with Victoria Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2023 citizens of the year awards in Frankston were a terrific event. The Citizen of the Year was Warwick Exton, who is an amazing 100-year-old, cheeky man, who I have spoken about in the chamber before. His contributions to the community are outstanding, and his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Action Sweetwater Creek</span>, is a great historical record of some very important environmental work in our community. Young Citizen of the Year, Jack Lyons, is right now incredibly tired because he has almost finished running 50 marathons in 50 days to raise money for those experiencing homelessness. It's a feat that I think is actually unimaginable, and he is amazing for having done it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Group of the Year, that I am an ambassador for, was the Women's Spirit Project, which grew out of a grassroots community initiative established by women for women within Frankston. Jodie Belyea is a woman who is incomparable; she has such a drive and passion to serve our community and to help women who are vulnerable or in need. It is so well-deserved for everyone who was part of the Women's Spirit Project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council's Young Citizen of the Year was Josh Berry from Mount Eliza, who is collecting 50,000 pairs of socks so that every one of the 23,000 homeless people in Victoria can have two pair each. What a contribution and dedication to the community! Congratulations, everyone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to introduce this motion and to acknowledge and remember the 14th anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires. On the morning of 7 February 2009, the state of Victoria woke up to a hot and windy day. Some saw it as a perfect time to do their washing; others thought it was a good idea to do some gardening, which was not the best case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the perfect day for fire conditions was just that: an exceptionally hot and dry week, coupled with being in the middle of a drought. During this time, Premier Brumby was scoffed at for his calls to be prepared and for acknowledging that this was going to be a very, very tough day. What we didn't know was that it was a day that would go on where 173 people would lose their lives and 414 people would be injured. It was a day when we lost 35 children and 16 became orphans. It was a day when up to a million animals died. It was a day when 450,000 hectares across the state were burnt, taking with them 3,500 buildings—including more than 2,000 homes. It was a day that scarred communities, and the lives and memories of all those Victorians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fires that spread throughout Victoria were ferocious and devastating; some were started by electrical faults and others by lightning. But a few were started by arson. The most devastating fire was the Kilmore East fire, which burnt through Wandong and reached all the way to Kinglake, Broadford, Healesville and Toolangi. This fire, thanks to winds which drove the fire up to 200 kilometres per hour, spread up to 40 kilometres away and claimed the lives of 119 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a day that turned out with us losing friends, neighbours and people we just knew in the community. I think of my friend Reg Evans, who always used to be at the St Andrews market. Whenever you walked in there he would say, 'That's why, boy, we go round and take it.' It has never been the same to go back to that market without having Reg there to give you a push along and make sure that every person put the Labor flyers onto their stalls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of this loss and devastation, our community stood up and helped. Over a thousand CFA volunteers were there, and other firefighters, who served their communities and fought the fire. This was a fire like no other. There had been scenes up in Coleraine, where the leaves on the trees had frozen in the direction that the fire went. Fire jumped from house to house—in some areas 50 metres apart, ignoring the bush in the middle and just jumping where the oxygen was available on a cleared house block. It taught our volunteers and our fire departments how to redo bushfires, because they had never seen a fire of such intensity and destruction before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will never know the full cost of what actually happened. In fact, it took until 19 March 2009 for the last, final fire to be extinguished. Our volunteers and firies worked tirelessly to bring these fires under control, putting themselves in danger to protect others. To this day, we are endlessly thankful for what they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also thankful to all the other volunteers who supported the firefighters and everyone else in the clean-up and rebuilding efforts, from the pubs that stayed open to make sure all those volunteers got a feed to the people who helped go through the wreckage and clean up, and everyone in between. Those who gave up their time to support our community—I remain thankful for them every single day. They showed true grit—true Australian grit—and determination. It was the definition of mateship, to stand up and give others a hand when they need it. It's the kind of stuff that should inspire us as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we remember the Black Saturday bushfires, it's important to continue to acknowledge the ongoing ramifications that these natural disasters can have on a community. The physical scars can still be seen today, burnt into the landscape, and I believe it's a good metaphor for how this disaster still lingers in the minds and hearts of all of us affected in those areas. I want to acknowledge Christine Nixon. Christine was pilloried from pillar to post for her work, but she was there every day. Every single community event, no matter what, day or night, she was there listening. It takes someone with immense strength to be able to do that. Day in, day out, she turned up and helped, and she should be recognised for the great work she did, along with her former colleague in the state parliament Ben Hardman. Ben was someone who was there. He knew a lot of people who perished, but he was there every single day and helped us out. Cameron Caine, a former Liberal candidate for the seat of McEwen in 2010, was a local policeman at the time, and he saw the devastation and what happened in Kinglake. It's taken a toll on him. He's still a good mate of mine, and I still pick on him because he needs it, to keep him on his toes! But he was someone who stood up and fought, day in, day out, to help people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I thank the member for McEwen for this motion, and I'm honoured to speak here today and pay tribute to those who lost their lives, those who were injured and those who lost everything on 7 February 2009—14 years ago last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Black Saturday is etched into our memories in Indi. It's a day we will never forget. We remember the way the smoke burned our eyes and our throats, the extreme heat and the way the wind whipped up the embers and flame and destroyed all in its path. We remember the overwhelming roar, like a jumbo jet. We remember the way the orange sky turned black and the fire that seemed to come at us from all directions. We remember the panic and anguish as we waited to hear word about our loved ones, whether they'd made it out alive. We remember the way we felt joy and relief when there was good news, only to be hit with the devastation when there was the worst news of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That day, 173 lives were lost, the majority of which were in Indi. Today, we remember those we lost in Kinglake, Kinglake West, Marysville, Narbethong, Flowerdale, Strath Creek, Toolangi, Mudgegonga and the countless other towns and communities that still bear the scars today. Today we also pay tribute to the brave men and women from our emergency services, who put their lives on the line to protect others and who answered the call to protect their communities—the CFA, the SES and many more volunteers, thousands upon thousands, who rolled up their sleeves to come to the aid of those who had lost everything, and they came day after day. The way the community came together on that day and in the days and years that followed is etched in my memory as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we should also note that what we are remembering and paying tribute to is not just one day. For those in fire-affected communities, this is not all in the past. Recovery is a marathon, and they're still running it. The trauma and scars in our community stretch for years and remain just below the surface. One survivor, Bron Sparkes, who lived in Kinglake, told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the fires, that it's:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… less about moving on and more about adapting to that experience and figuring out how to live while carrying that experience with you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You incorporate the experience into every cell of your mind and body. It's really how you work with that as you progress through life. Because it's a part of you and it will always be part of you. And you can't move on from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For some, working out how to carry that experience with them as they move on through life has been incredibly hard. The mental health aspects, the effects on families, the impact on children who were so small when faced with such terror have been significant. And while Black Saturday was a tragedy, and the years that have followed have been tough, the fires have also left us with a legacy of community, of togetherness, of connection, of resilience. There are many groups and projects that started as a response to the fires but have continued on over the years; they've transformed to meet the ongoing and changing needs of their communities. Firefoxes Australia started in Kinglake, in the aftermath of the fire, helping with the immediate recovery and relief, and growing to help the community consider what the new normal would look like after the fires. And now Firefoxes supports women to embrace and realise their dreams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foundation Murrindindi began as the Marysville and Triangle Community Foundation to continue the recovery and allocate funds, but now works towards a vision of thriving, vibrant and connected communities within the Murrindindi shire. Neighbourhood Houses, Men's Sheds still connect with people in our communities post fires, and that's vital work that's too often unnoticed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the connection that's created and supported by these groups at local, sporting and community events that is the real key to recovering from a disaster like Black Saturday. Because long after the buildings are rebuilt, it's the community building that really is what government must be funding and supporting for the long term. These are just some examples of the hundreds of groups and initiatives that were forged in the fire but continue to serve and connect our communities now and into the future. I'm proud to pay tribute to them, I thank them, and I remember those from 14 years ago.</span>

                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I thank my friend, and my neighbour to the north, the member for McEwen for bringing forward this motion, and the member for Indi for sharing her reflections and her communities needs as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The past 14 years have, for many people in Victoria, been incredibly difficult. There has been a lot of rebuilding to do, not just of physical bricks and mortar but of people and of communities. This work is ongoing. And while the fires did not burn in Jagajaga, they were just next door, to our north, and many locals did feel the impact. They were the people who rushed to provide support as CFA members, as community members. They stood with family, friends, colleagues who lost lives, property and livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Saturday bushfires loom large for people in our part of the world. And so today, not long after the 14th anniversary of the fires, we remember the 173 lives lost, the 414 people injured and the destruction of over 3½ thousand structures, including 2,000 homes. We also remember the loss of animals that day—domestic and wild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bushfire is a threat in communities like mine, particularly in the north-eastern part of the electorate. In Kangaroo Ground, Research, Eltham and Eltham North it's something that communities live with every summer. And I recognise and thank the volunteers and members of our emergency services, particularly the CFA, who continue to put themselves on the front line to protect our communities. Eltham, Research, Kangaroo Ground and communities across Nillumbik have volunteer brigades made up of locals protecting locals. And on this day, Black Saturday, just over 14 years ago it was an all-in effort from these brigades and services and the people who support them right across the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that many in Melbourne and surrounds know of the Kangaroo Ground war memorial tower in my electorate. It has a long history, including on Black Saturday. It was a fire-spotting tower. The book <span style="font-style:italic;">King</span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ake</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">350</span> tells us how, on the day, from the top of the tower fire spotter Colleen Keating watched in disbelief at the size and speed of the thing as it came pouring over the slopes of Mount Sugarloaf and raced towards St Andrews. It was a mountain of smoke 10 kilometres high and two kilometres wide. And how, if not for a wind change, the communities impacted and the loss of life could have been even worse. The book says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The wind change would prove to be a bullet dodged for the residents of Melbourne's outer suburbs, a close escape most still don't understand they had. Given its speed, energy and direction, in another hour or two the inferno would have descended upon the tightly packed, overgrown suburbs of the northeast: Warrandyte, Hurstbridge, Diamond Creek, Greensborough, Eltham. For Melbourne it was a near miss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of these fires and in the face of this awful tragedy, community near and far came together, and we saw the best of people come out. Victorians pulled together. The generosity of so many, including those who had lost so much themselves, was obvious and widespread. Here in our country we have seen too often in recent years—through fires, floods, cyclones, and other disasters—Australians coming together and Australians supporting each other. It is a critical part of our infrastructure, our resilience and our community. Again, I thank everyone who gave their support that day, the people who are there for the good times and the bad and who stand up when they're needed. I know there are people in my community and in others who still bear the scars of standing up on that day and supporting others, and our thoughts are with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Black Saturday also showed us the failures of a system that was not prepared for the scale of this disaster, either on that day or in the aftermath. For many Australians, the places they live in are areas that have faced or could face a disaster, and it is important that as communities and as governments we think about this and prepare ourselves, our properties and our communities accordingly and that we encourage all around us—our neighbours, our communities, our governments—to do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourteen years on from Black Saturday we pause and remember the people who were lost and those who are still here but whose lives changed forever that day—the people who continue to struggle with mental health issues and other challenges. We remember the communities that are on that long path to recovery and that, while many things have recovered after 14 years, some things can never be recovered.</span>

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I commend the member for McEwen for his important motion on Black Saturday. I spoke last week on the anniversary and commemorated the 173 lives lost, and today I want to share my story of Black Saturday—my memories of that day as well as the importance it plays in my role in this House and the importance that we as leaders support and continue to support Australians who are impacted by emergencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that day I went to my mother's house in Yarra Glen to help her evacuate and, in looking back, I know I naively made every mistake in the book. So one thing I urge all Australians, as we come out of this bushfire season and enter another one next year, is to not be complacent. So, we went to visit to evacuate my mother. We left when we could see flames, which is rule No. 1 to never do. As we left Yarra Glen—and the member for Jagajaga talked about the wind change, and it definitely saved a lot of Melbourne and a lot of lives—for us, that wind change put us into the fire front, and in about two seconds the flames went from about a kilometre away to engulfing the car that I was driving and that my then fiancee, now wife, was in with me. At that moment we thought our lives were over. I could not see anything outside of the windscreen other than smoke and flames. In a millisecond I calculated that the road we were on was about 200 metres to the bend and that if we hit that bend it wouldn't really matter, because we wouldn't be here. So, with foot to the floor, we were going in excess of 130 or 140 kilometres, as my wife repeated, in tears, 'I love you, I love you, I love you.' In that moment we truly believed that our lives would be over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got through those flames, escaped to the other side. My mum and her husband were in the car behind us and as we got through that, what felt like forever—it was maybe 10 to 15 seconds; I don't know—we did not know where they were. They did not have the luxury of speeding up, because they knew we were in front of them, and they couldn't see either. As a mother does, she wasn't prepared to risk running into us, so she continued at a slower speed and showed courage that defies logic. I share that story because it's foundational to who I am and why I'm here today, which is to make sure that we take our lived experiences as community members and bring that into this House. That's why I'll always support and advocate for emergency funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to share that story because we were fortunate: we didn't lose property. I lost friends—friends passed away—but my family survived. The scars of that day stay with me to this day, and I know that last week, 14 years on, there were many who felt that it's still raw. I can picture those memories like I'm watching a movie. It doesn't leave you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to all those survivors who are still battling scars. In many ways, it's the smallest things; a very hot day or the smell of smoke brings those memories back at the most unexpected times. I know that there are many Black Saturday survivors out there who continue to struggle, and, while we pay tribute to them, it also makes it difficult for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to not just those who survived but also the emergency services. What a lot of people don't know is that they didn't just volunteer on the day or on the day after. I've got good friends in the CFA who were cleaning up and fighting those fires for months afterwards—three to four months after. The emotional and psychological toll that it took on them and that it continues to take on them is significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I urge that we continue to make sure we support mental health and provide PTSD support for emergency services, because they are the volunteers of our community who not only put their physical bodies on the line for us. They put their mental health on the line every day, and Black Saturday was just one of the many examples of the impact that emergencies have not just in my community but across the country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I too want to acknowledge the words of the member for Casey. Like many Victorians, he has a story. It's important that we share those stories—it's what makes anniversaries so powerful—so that we never forget and never have another generation that have stories of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 February 2009, Victoria experienced an unprecedented and catastrophic event, as firestorms raged across much of the state. There have been a lot of learnings since that day, the day that many remember as Black Saturday, but it's important that we stop and reflect and remember what did occur so that we can learn from this event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state was on red alert, and many commented that, when they woke up and felt the heat, they felt that something was going to happen that day—it didn't feel right. I can remember that I worked early that day. I came out of the building where I was working just before nine o'clock and couldn't get over how hot it was. You did have that gut feeling: what is going to happen today? As the day unfolded, alerts popped up, as well as messages and phone calls. It was a dark day. It was a tough day for many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bendigo the initial fire didn't break out until late in the afternoon. It was in Maiden Gully at about four o'clock. The wind gusts were around 80 kilometres, and temperatures soared into the mid-40s. The flames reached 20 metres high, and the inferno travelled towards Bendigo through Maiden Gully, West Bendigo and California Gully. The fire came within two kilometres of the Bendigo CBD. It could have been a lot worse than what it was that day, but the amazing effort of locals, our emergency services and volunteers prevented the catastrophic, which happened to many others, from happening to our town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bendigo we did lose one life. Forty-eight-year-old Mick Kane was tragically killed by the Black Saturday bushfires. Like many on that day, Mick was fighting to save his home and family. In Bendigo the fires devastated an area of about 500 hectares. Sixty-one homes were lost; 115 outbuildings were destroyed; many pets and wildlife were lost; and caravans, boats and much of people's loved possessions were lost. A refuge centre was established in Kangaroo Flat, where about 50 residents without homes sheltered until more appropriate accommodation could be found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area in my electorate to be hit hard was Redesdale, just south-west of Bendigo. About 10,000 hectares were left ravaged. Redesdale was isolated, and the locals there felt very lucky. They believe that, when the fire formed a horseshoe shape around the town and cut the area off, it was only bulldozers and heavy machinery deployed to build a dirt barrier between the fires and people that saved them. Over 300 people fought the fires in Bendigo, and about the same did in Redesdale. Six aircraft flew over. There were 46 trucks, three bulldozers and four graders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that the fires in Bendigo broke out late in the afternoon, with so many others already deployed to fires around the state. The town was really on its own. But I want to acknowledge that the majority of the people fighting the fires were volunteers. We have roughly 40 volunteer fire brigades across the Bendigo electorate and only one professional brigade from Fire Rescue Victoria. Whilst they were involved on that day, it really was those volunteer firefighters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to acknowledge the incredible bravery and efforts of all emergency services on that day: firefighters, paramedics, police officers and the locals who banded together to help out. For those CFA volunteers, it was an extraordinary effort, with many of them fighting to save their neighbour's home whilst they may have lost their own home. To this day, when you visit their stations, they always share their reflection and memory of what happened on that day. It is still talked about. It is still that mark in the calendar where people share. Many will never forget and many of the firefighters still live with those experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a lot of government assistance that did help both recoveries. There were lots of packages to help rebuild towns and lots of work that was done to support the mental health and the scarring. But many will not forget the images of the smoke blooms, the orange skies, the horizon over One Tree Hill. They will never be forgotten, and may they never be forgotten, because it is only then that we learn to do better next time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  I rise to add my voice to those who have already spoken on the anniversary of the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires. Black Saturday occurred in February 2009 and, for those of us who were in the state on 7 February, I don't think there would have been anyone who wouldn't have thought that this was going to be one of the worst days for bushfires in Victoria if those fires got away. Sadly, that's what occurred. One of the things that we have to do is remember the lessons learned. The sad reality is that we still haven't learned all the lessons from Black Saturday. If you look at how the majority of fires started, you see they were overhead power lines, and yet, following Black Saturday, we have still had fires started by overhead power lines in the state of Victoria. Now, you can never foolproof and you can never completely bulletproof every single way a fire can start, but we still haven't done enough to make sure that overhead power lines are not the source of bushfires in the state of Victoria. That is something that we need to continue to redouble our efforts on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A hundred and seventy-three people lost their lives, 414 people were injured and more than 450,000 hectares of land was lost. It was a catastrophic set of fires the like of which, I hope, we will never see again. In my electorate, there were two serious fires on that day. The first was at Coleraine. If it weren't for a sudden shift of wind, it is likely the whole township of Coleraine would have been burnt to the ground. In many ways, what happened was nothing short of a miracle. The wind changed to a nor'-westerly just as the fire was approaching the town, and that saved it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend all those who fought the fires right across the state, but particularly in my electorate and particularly those who fought the fire around Coleraine, and give them a big vote of thanks for what they do. I also recognise John Smeets, who went to save the house and the farm machinery around a neighbour's place, but that wind change caught him unawares. Sadly, he received burns to over 50 per cent of his body. I've met John Smeets and I've discussed with him what happened on that day, and I must say his bravery and the way he has dealt with what occurred to him are an absolute credit to him. It shows, once again, the dangers that bushfires present to our communities and the reason we have to continue doing what we can to keep our community safe from bushfires. There was also a fire at Weerite; 3,200 acres were burnt and a rail line was damaged between Geelong and Warrnambool—over 3,000 sleepers damaged. Fortunately, there was no serious injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to end on this note: in the last five or six years we've seen significant changes made to the Country Fire Authority in Victoria. That has hurt volunteerism in the CFA in regional and rural Victoria, and we need to put it all to bed. We need to get back to doing everything we can to support our wonderful volunteers in regional and rural Victoria. We have to make sure that we're providing them with the support and the encouragement to keep our communities safe. The Andrews government needs to stop the politics in the CFA and get behind our wonderful volunteers, otherwise, if we get another fire like this, our communities won't be— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nicotine vaping products, or vapes, may have some benefit for smokers who use them to quit cigarettes, but vaping carries very real risks, and the number of young people vaping is increasing dramatically. Health professionals say we are sleepwalking into a public health disaster. The policy challenge is making vapes available for smokers where appropriate but not available to children and young people. In October 2021 Australia became the first country to introduce a medical access model of regulating vapes. This requires that people wanting to vape get a prescription in order to obtain vapes with nicotine in them. There have been challenges with enforcement of this model, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration is considering potential reforms. I know the minister is concerned about the impact of vaping and the need to reinvigorate action on smoking, but this is an urgent issue that needs an urgent response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main problem is that there's a loophole allowing users and retailers to import vapes from overseas if they are not labelled as nicotine. But labelling on imports is unreliable; most vapes being sold contain nicotine, including some with labelling that says they do not. This means that vapes containing nicotine are getting past customs and are being sold over the counter, including to kids. There is growing community and expert concern—not about smokers transitioning down to vaping but about young nonsmokers transitioning up to vaping. In the words of a 23-year-old constituent, 'Most of my friends vape and none of them were smokers before.' In the short term, the nicotine in vaping is damaging and addictive, and ANU has shown that, in the long term, nonsmokers who vape are three times as likely to take up smoking than nonsmokers who do not vape. As for the rest of the chemicals in vapes, we don't yet know about the long-term impacts, because vapes are so new. Vapes contain a range of chemicals and solvents, including flavouring agents, many of which are toxic or carcinogenic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vapes are being targeted at kids. They come in flavours that sound like lollies—cola, strawberry, watermelon, pink lemonade. Teenagers are buying vapes at convenience stores and petrol stations and online. It's hard to know how prevalent vaping is right now amongst young people, because it's growing so rapidly. A few years ago, NSW Health reported that the proportion of young people vaping had more than doubled between 2020 and 2021 to 11 per cent. Since then, anecdotally, at least in my electorate, it looks like it has increased significantly. On the weekend, the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper reported nearly 4,000 suspensions in WA public schools last year due to vaping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tobacco industry has seen the potential for its future market and is now keen to promote vaping as well as cigarettes. Responsible Vaping Australia—which sounds like a good idea—was established by British American Tobacco. It has an interest in stopping the black market and developing its own new markets for vaping products. Exploiting a loophole in the tobacco advertising regulatory regime, Responsible Vaping Australia is advertising online, because it can be classified as political advertising, not tobacco advertising. There's also a proliferation of reports supporting vaping, many funded directly or indirectly by the tobacco and vaping industries. GPs say this is all part of a cynical attempt by the tobacco industry to hook a new generation on nicotine. Schools are doing their best to limit vaping but are losing the battle. AHISA, the peak body for independent schools, says, 'Despite schools' best efforts, students' willingness to experiment with vaping appears to be increasing and schools are being challenged not only to counter students' interest in vaping but to help meet the needs of students who may be suffering a serious and potentially fatal addiction.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's the solution? Vaping may have a place for people trying to quit smoking, although there is debate about its effectiveness. To end the black market in vapes, we need a ban on importation and supply of all e-cigarette products, regardless of labelled nicotine content, except by pharmacies for smokers with a prescription. This way, we can then implement stronger border controls to intercept e-cigarette products. We need to update our tobacco advertising ban, which was introduced before the internet and has significant loopholes. This is urgent, and I urge the minister to take action. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin very much for moving this motion, which is very important for the health and wellbeing of the Australian public and, in particular, Australian children, who are being targeted by the tobacco industry. I can start my speech by saying that the tobacco industry is an industry as malignant as the diseases it causes. It wanders the corridors of parliament, trying to lobby politicians to maintain its business model. I have long been concerned about the vaping industry, which has been promoted by the tobacco industry as part of their business model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, with the chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, I and other members of parliament conducted an inquiry into vaping and vaping products. I think it's illustrated really by one thing. We had a lot of evidence from people all around the country who were pro-vape, anti-vape, doctors, vaping groups, patients, smokers et cetera, but I remember very well the public meeting we had in Sydney where the so-called 'medical' representative of British American Tobacco had come from England to give evidence. When I asked her whether the industry itself was conducting any research into the side effects or any of the long-term effects of vaping, she looked at the floor and didn't answer to start with. She then looked up, look down again and said, 'No.' We asked her again, 'Are you doing any research into the effects of vaping?' The answer was no. That's how bad this industry is, and yet we still see them wandering the halls of parliament and meeting with politicians. We know that one group, Philip Morris, donated $55,000 to the National Party in the last election and also $55,000 to the Liberal Democrats. They are still trying to lobby the parliament to allow free access to vaping for children, really for adolescents to adults, somehow in the misguided thought that they may stop people smoking. There is no evidence to suggest that. I think that the prescription model we have in Australia is a really good one. The only argument the tobacco industry has to that is that in other countries they allow free access to vaping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has had some of the best antitobacco legislation in the world and we should not compromise it by allowing free access to vaping. The products are not tested. We know that even though they say they don't contain nicotine, most products do. They are targeted at children, as the member for Curtin has already mentioned. There are flavours like watermelon, peaches and cream—things that clearly target children as a way to get them into nicotine addiction. And nicotine addiction is one of the strongest addictions that you can have. People who are addicted to nicotine have a much smaller chance of being able to be weaned from it than, for example, people who are addicted to alcohol. It is a terrible addiction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Effective legislation can stop this, and we have to fight to continue it. There have been multiple inquiries. After our 2018 inquiry into vaping, in 2019 the tobacco industry managed to get one of their favoured politicians, who's still in this parliament, to start yet another inquiry into vaping. They wanted to make it available through retail outlets virtually to everyone. They said it would be restricted to people over 18, but there's very little way of enforcing that at all. The Retailers Association has been somehow coerced into agreeing that it's a good thing to have vaping available through petrol stations, corner stores and retail outlets everywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tobacco industry has not given up its fight. They should not still be wandering the corridors of this parliament, trying to coerce politicians into agreeing to their very flawed and dangerous business model. Once again, I thank the member for Curtin for bringing this motion to the parliament. It is very important that we maintain vigilance. Vaping is not something we want our children to be doing. It is yet another pathway to be addicted to nicotine, and it's disgraceful that there is yet another attempt for this by the tobacco industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I rise in support of the member for Curtin's motion that calls on the government to address the increased use of e-cigarettes, particularly amongst young people. As a doctor, I am alarmed at the prospect of Australians once again having the wool pulled over our eyes by the tobacco industry, as they now prey on our children via the portal of e-cigarettes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia led the world when it came to implementing public health initiatives to protect Australians from smoking-related harm. In 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to implement plain packaging laws for cigarettes. To date, 24 countries have followed Australia's lead in adopting similar rules. Over the last three decades, smoking rates in this country have fallen from 24 per cent to 11 per cent. And yet here we are, 10 years on from that success, readying ourselves for yet another a battle—a battle against e-cigarettes: smoking 2.0. What's worse is that this time it is our children who are the target of the tobacco industry's predatory behaviour, with the bright-coloured packaging and the lollipop flavours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Health Organization has confirmed that e-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to both users and nonusers who are exposed to the aerosols second-hand. Don't be fooled by the sweet smell of the emissions: e-cigarettes can contain as many as 200 toxic chemicals. A single disposable product can contain as much nicotine as 150 traditional cigarettes and cost as little as $5. Not infrequently, they contain nicotine even if they are labelled as nicotine free—not quite the cookies and cream or the strawberry kisses that the packaging promises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research published as recently as December 2022 concluded that vaping is the strongest risk factor for smoking, and a recent study of adolescents in New South Wales reported that half of the kids who regularly consumed e-cigarettes had never smoked. So, rather than being a smoking cessation tool, for young people e-cigarettes are actually a gateway drug to smoking. So it is no surprise that major international tobacco companies have invested heavily in e-cigarettes in recent years, and tobacco companies now own many of the top e-cigarette brands. It seems like the strategy of big tobacco is to move our children from e-cigarettes to cigarettes by getting them hooked on nicotine. Media, school and community reports suggest that the use of e-cigarettes amongst young people in New South Wales has exploded in recent years. Stores which sell e-cigarettes are popping up in communities all across Australia, including in my electorate of Mackellar. These stores are often located near bus stops and train stations that ferry our children to and from school. There have been recent reports of tobacconists selling e-cigarettes to children in school uniforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the New South Wales ministry of health shows that in 2021 the number of illegal nicotine products that were seized from retailers was over 11 times the number from the same period in 2020, and 80 per cent of adolescents said they found it easy to access this product. Something must be done to stop the sale of these highly toxic, highly addictive products to our children. Big tobacco is preying on our youth, and all levels of government must work together to stop this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are steps that the Commonwealth government can and should take to help fix this ballooning problem. They include stronger border protections and customs prohibitions for all vaping products; better minimum quality and safety standards—plain packaging and health warnings for starters; and prohibiting all added flavours. I call on the government to act swiftly and decisively to protect our children from the growing scourge of e-cigarettes. We must once again become world leaders in protecting our children from both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for drawing attention to this important health issue and allowing us all the opportunity to speak on it. In September last year, the Cancer Council published the results of their Generation Vape study, which looks at the use of vaping products by young people in New South Wales aged between 14 and 17 years old. This study found that 30 per cent to 14- to 17-year-olds had used vaping products. More than half of that group knew that the vape they used contained nicotine, and most of these teenagers found it very easy to access vapes. It is clear that the regulations on vaping are not preventing vaping products from being accessed by the general public and our kids. My daughters are nearly 12 years old. My son is eight. I don't want one of them to be able to freely and openly access a product that is illegal to them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Current laws are co-administered by the Commonwealth and state and territory legislation and allow smokers to obtain these products solely for smoking cessation, following consultation and prescription from a medical practitioner. Those products can only be lawfully supplied by pharmacies in Australia. We all know that's not the case. In my own electorate of Bennelong, you can walk into countless tobacconists and convenience stores and purchase nicotine vapes. I know this is the case not only in my electorate but right throughout Australia. Clearly, a shadow market of vaping product exists, and they are being easily accessed unlawfully by children, adolescents, and adults alike, without any prescription. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be honest, though, it is not really a shadow market or an underground market; it's out there for everybody to see. Tobacconists openly display huge neon signs advertising their vaping products. This illegal trade of vaping products brings serious concerns about this gateway to smoking and nicotine addiction and the long-term health implications of nicotine use. In their review of global evidence of the health risks of vaping products, the Australian National University found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is strong evidence that never smokers who use e-cigarettes are on average around three times as likely than those who do not use e-cigarettes to initiate cigarette smoking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they form a dependency on nicotine. The danger is that many young people think that vaping is safer than cigarette use. I mean, why wouldn't you? They're marketed to the young, and the vaping device can be colourful. It can light up, and, for some, it can be a stylish accessory. Then you go into the flavours, and a quick browse online shows that you can get blue raspberry; Fuji apple, strawberry and nectarine—I don't know how they fit all of those flavours into one vape, but they do—and even Granny Smith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As relatively new products, the health implications of vaping are relatively unknown. However, this lack of information does not mean that they're safe. We know that e-cigarette users are exposed to chemicals and toxins that can harm their health. We know that vaping usage can cause throat irritation, coughing, dizziness, headaches, nausea, serious burns and injuries, nicotine poisoning and lung injury, which can sometimes be fatal. And they're only the implications we know of. There's not enough information to understand the impacts of vaping on conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, reproductive health and mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many constituents have contacted our office, urging me to reach out to the government to take further action, which is why we have. Late last year, the health minister announced that the TGA will undertake a public consultation process on potential reforms to regulate nicotine vaping products, and we heard of some of those measures from the member for Curtin, the member for Mackellar and the member for Macarthur. We need to understand where the current regulatory framework fails and what action governments can take to curb the unlawful supply of these products; to create a regulated source of these products; to strengthen the product standard, making them unattractive to children and adolescents; and to clarify the status of nicotine vaping as therapeutic goods, ensuring that the regulatory framework captures any vaping product containing nicotine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor governments have a proud history of implementing world-leading anti-smoking policies. It was us who brought in plain packaging legislation, which was then a world first. I'm confident we'll continue to work hard with industry stakeholders and the general public to protect my kids, our kids and friends from this dangerous product. We'll continue to take decisive action in this priority health area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few years, Australians have collectively experienced some of the most challenging times in decades, from a once-in-100-year pandemic to several once-in-100-year natural disasters. And, unfortunately, these challenges don't seem to be in the past. We've recently seen the devastating flood events that inundated large parts of the Kimberley and Western Australia, and the bushfires raging across Queensland. Recovery efforts for these will take months, if not years. Whilst local, state, and federal governments have a role to play in assisting those who experience difficult times, it really is the volunteers throughout our community who provide that immediate and ongoing support to those who are most vulnerable. And, whilst they don't volunteer for recognition, they absolutely deserve it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From an economic perspective, volunteers provided almost 600 million hours of voluntary work in 2019. Whilst the exact estimates of how much this equates to for the economy are difficult to quantify, it's certainly worth billions of dollars. And that's purely economic. Socially, it's invaluable. Each hour that someone volunteers, by delivering food, cleaning our waterways or environment, fighting fires, assisting during natural disasters or coaching our children, makes such a difference to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, volunteer organisations have been severely impacted over the last few years. The casualisation of the workforce and other issues have put increased pressure on organisations at a time when volunteering rates have continued to decline. Since 2014 there has been a 20 per cent drop in volunteer hours. The Albanese government will provide an additional $4 million boost for the Volunteer Resource Centres across the country to bolster their efforts in recruiting, training and supporting volunteers. I would encourage anyone who can volunteer to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who has volunteered so much in the past, I know that you get much more out of the work than you put in. Helping people in the community is definitely a rewarding thing to do, and our communities, charities and NGOs depend on it. Volunteering builds social cohesion and increases wellbeing for both the volunteer and those they're helping. I commend Volunteering Australia for their new National Strategy for Volunteering. Further, the Albanese government is providing $367,000 to Volunteering Australia to assist in the strategy's implementation. Society has changed dramatically since the last strategy in 2011, so it's very important that they continue to modernise and update the approach to volunteering and recruitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as members of parliament must do what we can to support and raise the volunteers in our community up. In the electorate of Werriwa, I formally recognise volunteers throughout my community. Last year was the seventh year I presented the Werriwa Volunteer Awards. The 2022 recipients were Kristy Parkes, Sharon Pietrantonio Tompsett, Cecilia Caburian, Pam Lawther, Ann Murphy, Michael Stokes, Maria Tonkin, Tisela Vaifale, Janette Wilson, Nabil Jamhour, Bruce Clark, Chris D'Arcy and Susan Reea. Thank you all for the incredible work you do in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be running the Werriwa Volunteers Awards again this year in May. Nominations will open in the coming weeks. In fact, a former Werriwa awardee was the Australian Volunteer of the Year, announced when the 2023 Australia Day Awards were announced. Amar Singh and Turbans 4 Australia provide meals and practical support for those experiencing difficulties caused by economic circumstances or natural disasters. The 2022 Werriwa awardee, Chris D'Arcy, was Liverpool City Council's Citizen of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to bring together various volunteers and organisations not only to recognise their contribution but to talk about the needs of our communities and their concerns about how we can help. For those in New South Wales, you can visit the New South Wales government website makeadifference.volunteering.nsw.gov.au, which allows you to find opportunities in organisations based on your interests, whether it's in animal welfare, the environment, the arts, communities or disaster relief. Thank you again to all the volunteers in Werriwa and all around Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for bringing forward this very important motion and for giving us the opportunity in this place to thank and celebrate the incredible work done by volunteers across our nation. Volunteering is an incredibly powerful expression of who we are, what we value and what kind of world we wish to create for ourselves, our communities, our children and future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering has always been an essential part of Australian society, but it has taken on even greater significance in recent years. From recession to climate disasters to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, volunteer workers and organisations have been at the forefront of our crisis response, and they will continue to lead our nation's recovery. Volunteers provide health, disability and emergency services. They run sporting activities and environmental conservation efforts and provide patronage to the arts. The list is so long. Many of them are the linchpins of local committees, associations, clubs and schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest ABS statistics show that one in five Australians volunteer. Though we are yet to see a return to prepandemic levels, this is a huge number of people, and the significance of their contribution to the economy really needs to be noted. Volunteering efforts contribute some $46 billion to the Australian economy. It's what makes our world and our wheels continue to go around. It's important to note that this data is not inclusive of the informal volunteering work of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who give back to their respective communities as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time we thanked and acknowledged those who have selflessly dedicated their time, energy and expertise towards putting the needs of others in their community before their own. As Australians move back to their normal lives in the aftermath of COVID-19 lockdowns, the absence of volunteers and services that they make possible will become more and more apparent and concerning. Some organisations are struggling to recruit and maintain a volunteer workforce to fulfil their purpose, while some are struggling under the weight of exacerbated community demands. The decrease in volunteer numbers will diminish or eliminate activities and services that our communities rely on and will disproportionately impact society's most vulnerable. So I urge everyone to consider volunteering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, we must continue to recognise the value of volunteering and ensure that it is adequately supported. We need the right infrastructure in place to support volunteer organisations, including better labour force planning, greater coordination of recovery responses, and additional training and guidance for volunteers and volunteer managers. We also need to ensure that we're doing all we can to make volunteering more accessible to those who want to get involved and make sure we have the right levers from a regulatory point of view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also urge the government to continue with their communities grants, for example, which are so important in supporting smaller organisations within our communities. Without those grants these organisations would not have gotten through the COVID period, and it is so important that those grants continue. We need to encourage greater technological adaptation among volunteer organisations which allows for more creative ways to recruit, provides more flexible ways to volunteer and facilitates a new generation's expectation of how they can contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I'd like to thank all the organisations in Warringah who do such an amazing job, from our RFS to the SES to the communities from Meals on Wheels to OzHarvest—so many organisations doing amazing work in feeding and helping our communities. And of course I'd like to thank the Team Zali volunteers. We've seen a real engagement in politics over the last few years, where communities are really finding their voice. This is democracy at work, and it helps us do politics differently in this place. We need to engage with our communities and make sure their views and concerns are represented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me it simply wouldn't be possible to represent Warringah without the assistance of so many volunteers in my electorate office, and I have to say a very specific thankyou. I have volunteers on the team have been there consistently for four years now. Every day of the week, every day of the year, they are there all the time to support me. So, to all of those—they know who I'm talking about, my reception angels and so many more who are helping me—thank you so much. The community of Warringah really appreciates it and knows how important it is. Some are incredible experts in their fields, and this opportunity to give back is so important. So, I commend this motion and I thank the member—and thank you to all the volunteers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I thank my friend the member for Werriwa for bringing this very important motion forward. We all know that the work of our local volunteers is a critical and valuable element of our community. The work is done day in day out, week in week out, every month of the year, without their asking for recognition or special awards. They do not seek any benefits other than knowing that they have made a positive contribution to our community. Volunteers turn a suburb into a community. But, as I said, the vast majority of volunteers rarely seek acknowledgement for their services and are often amongst some of our most humble and modest citizens. I take this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to all our volunteers. Please know that we do notice your efforts and that your community does recognise the invaluable role you play to make our people's lives richer and better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Volunteering Australian, our amazing volunteers contributed a staggering 600 million hours of voluntary work to their local communities in 2019. We have all done it: turned a snag at Bunnings for a local netball team, helped the local footy team on game day by running a raffle or cleaning out the sheds, helped the local RFS in their time of need, or established or worked with local Lions or Rotary clubs to deliver a much-needed project for our community. We have volunteers who work tirelessly in the homelessness space, advocating for human rights and looking after veterans and seniors—our local RSL subbranch and places like Southlakes Incorporated and Mum's Cottage. We have hundreds of volunteers in the Hunter electorate who deliver hundreds of thousands of meals each year to people at home through Meals on Wheels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is a flood, a fire, an earthquake or a cyclone, Australians are the best in the world at volunteering in trying and challenging times. We all know of the vital and important community support provided by our police, fire and ambulance services, and for this we are truly grateful. But I would also like to pay tribute and give thanks to our SES, the RFS and the VRA volunteers. Too often, we hear of volunteers who've lost their own property due to fire or flood while they were away helping others. It is this selfless determination to assist others during testing times that defines the principles of what it takes to be a volunteer, and the list goes on and on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be honest, we wouldn't have what we have here in Australia without our volunteers. Obviously, COVID has played a large part in the dramatic reduction in the number of hours people have given over the last three years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics' <span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eneral society survey</span> estimates that only 30 per cent of Australians aged 15 and over participated in volunteer work in 2019, and that dropped to 25 per cent in 2020. Put simply, we are volunteering less than we used to. We are not only less likely to volunteer but also less likely to join community organisations or play team sports. We've got fewer actual friends than we did in the 1980s, and we know fewer of our neighbours than we used to. We've become disconnected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the previous government's attacks on charities but, now that the adults are in charge, we've ended the war on charities and are working with volunteers and charities to build a more reconnected Australia. Last week, the government announced a once-in-a-generation review of Australian philanthropy, to be undertaken by the Productivity Commission. The goal of the review is to boost donations to charities and meet the Australian government's goal of doubling philanthropic giving by 2030. I give thanks to our Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, the Hon. Dr Andrew Leigh, who is driving this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are all guilty of being time poor. However, I encourage everyone to consider their potential to volunteer. Everyone can make a difference, and we know the positive impacts that volunteering can have on local communities, and its value to them. I will always support the organisations and individuals who dedicate their time for the betterment of our communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for this really important motion. It's crucial that we continue to recognise and thank our volunteers, and I'm sure every member in this House knows the power of our words when we mention their names and share their stories in this House. It's an important motion, and I'm honoured to speak on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often talk—and the books will tell you—about the three levels of government: federal, state and local. But, for myself, I have a passionate belief that the most important level is the fourth level: the community. In many ways, that's really represented by the amazing volunteers who give their time, give their effort and sacrifice so much. Our emergency services, our CFAs and our SES sacrifice not just their time but, in many cases, their health—both physical and mental—to serve our communities, and they don't ask for payment for that. I spoke earlier today and also last week about Black Saturday. The 14-year anniversary of that day is an important reminder for myself of the work that volunteers do, but I know that people volunteer across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I shared a post on social media about the culture of the CFA and a fundraiser that the Coldstream CFA Fire Brigade were doing to raise funds. One of my constituents—someone I know well—Patrick, posed the question: why do the police and the ambulance services get paid and not have to pay for their operating costs, but our SESs and our CFAs have to turn snags and do other fundraising on top of the service that they do for our community? It's a very good question, and it's one that I believe we in this house and in state and local government should have a conversation about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers in emergency services volunteer their time to save lives, not to turn sausages. They do that because they have to. A senior CFA member who is a volunteer suggested to me that CFAs in Victoria have to raise approximately $25,000 a year in operating costs just to keep going and to keep the doors open. I'm sure it's a very similar number across the country. It really is quite amazing that we're asking them to fundraise for themselves. I acknowledge the significant fiscal challenges that we face across the country, and historically emergency-services funding has been a state responsibility, but I believe this is a national conversation we need to have. We see more and more natural disasters on significant scales—and Black Saturday is one that I will talk a lot about, but there were significant bushfires in the summer of 2019, and clearly there are floods we have just experienced. We are asking these volunteers to do more and more with their time, and we need to support them. We need to find ways to give them the resources they need because we know that our community volunteers are the first responders who will be there. By the very nature of an emergency, we don't know when and how it's going to strike, so if we are unable to get significant paid resources—whether that be the army, professional firefighters or police—to that spot, it's always the community volunteers. It's so important that we give them the resources that they need to make sure that they can protect our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just emergency services they give so much to our communities. In Casey we are blessed as a semirural area to have amazing township groups that not only provide a strong voice for their communities but also organise activities to support their communities. Bec Rosel recently won the Yarra Ranges Council's Citizen of the Year for organising the Lilydale Street Fair through an organisation called the Lilydale Township Action Group. That idea was born out of helping a town that was really struggling with lockdowns of COVID. That's just one of the hundreds of examples I could give. Five minutes isn't enough time to talk about all the community groups who support so much, whether it's our Rotary, our Country Women's Association or the people who support charities like homeless organisations. Like every electorate across the country, Casey is blessed to have so many amazing volunteers, and I thank them for the time and the commitment that they give to our community. I thank their families because, in many ways, their families don't see as much of them as they could because they are serving our community. Those partners and children and family do that because they know they are giving back to make a stronger community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for this very important motion. I was reminded again of how important volunteering is when I was in a mobile office at the Wheelers Hill Shopping Centre in my electorate of Chisolm and I ran into friends from the Lions Club of Wheelers Hill, who were doing an amazing job raising money for the people suffering in Turkiye and Syria as a result of the earthquakes. I had a very good conversation with them about the contribution that they make to the community. They had a full day of activities planned right around the electorate, giving back to a community that they and I love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers, I think it's safe to say, are the heart of our community. They keep so many organisations going, whether they be sporting clubs, civic organisations, neighbourhood watches or emergency service groups. I was brought up in a family most members of which volunteered in various organisations, so the importance of volunteering and giving back to the community was instilled in me from a very young age. Volunteering at the local op shop, at the hospital kiosk, in music groups, by tutoring asylum seekers and with food rescue charities—these are different organisations that I and members of my family have participated in. Personally, I found it very enriching.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the very first announcements that I was able to make as a candidate during the election campaign was to reinstate an initiative that had been implemented by the wonderful former member for Chisolm Anna Burke—the Caroline Chisolm awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is named for one of Australia's most famous volunteers, Caroline Chisholm, who dedicated her life to civic service and to looking after the people around her in all of the communities that she lived in throughout her life. We held the Caroline Chisolm Awards last year around International Volunteers Day in December. It was my absolute honour to give a platform in our community to the people who give so much to the people around them. I want to name the Caroline Chisolm Award recipients here today because I can't acknowledge them enough, so at every opportunity that I have to name them I will take it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Lingling Zan; John Elliott; Wendy Hui Jiang and Polly Feng; Janice Heeley; Ling Wang; Lei Zhao, Don Cheyne; Sandra Robertson; Binyu Wang and Huiliang Ji; Ken Calder; Rongzong Lin; Johnny Hung Kwong Yu; Tess McBaron; Martika Lu; Bing Du; and Cheryl Webster. All of these people do work in so many different kinds of organisations: sporting groups, musical groups and through churches and neighbourhood houses, and with people of all different ages and from all walks of life. Particularly after the last few years of the pandemic, which was very challenging for communities, the fact that the people who had volunteered in the past jumped straight back into action and revived a lot of groups that may not have been able to meet during the very worst parts of the pandemic has been extraordinary. A lot of these groups are really roaring back to life. In December I was able to enjoy many Christmas events with a lot of these organisations, and this gave me another opportunity to say thank you for everything they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there's always a role for governments to do more to support the people in our communities who give so much of their time. That's why I'm really delighted that we have announced an inquiry into philanthropy and into ways that we can make it easier for people to give money and resources to people who set up the community groups that we would be lost without right across Australia. I'm looking forward to doing whatever I can in my local community to support the community groups and volunteers that enrich Chisholm, and I look forward to being part of a government that will do what it can to support the people who support our communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I'd like to thank volunteers across the country and encourage even more Australians to volunteer and to invest in their communities. I hope that this week's National Volunteering Conference in Canberra will leave attendees feeling valued and reinvigorated. The work you do is so incredibly important. So I rise to speak in support of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year saw the release of the National Strategy for Volunteering, which is due to be finalised and launched this month. We can't afford to take volunteering for granted. We know that, essentially, volunteering underpins the work of our community. The Volunteering Australia 2022 report provides an evidence base for this, with insight into the recent decline in volunteering. We have seen that decline over the last two decades but, in particular, we have seen a dramatic fall since COVID, and it just hasn't recovered. This worries me deeply and I know it worries many people in my community. We need to find ways for volunteers to reengage or to engage in the first place, and also to find ways to retain the volunteers that we currently have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that really concerns me, and many in my community, is funding for the National Network of Volunteer Resource Centres, known as VRCs. They are a vital part of Australia's existing volunteer ecosystem and they need to be retained. Last October the network reported that over half of the centres in the country were set to close or reduce services after changes to the funding model in mid-2022. That cut $3.4 million from the VRCs' direct budget and, again, we saw inadequate funding in last October's budget. They fill a vital role—effectively being the connector and the support base for volunteers and organisations looking for volunteers. I'm told they're pretty much out of reserves; many are effectively closing now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to give a couple of examples of Southern Volunteering in South Australia, one of the volunteer resource centres in my community, which has made volunteering accessible and inclusive for everyone. It worked with a person with cerebral palsy who was unable to communicate through speech and who used a wheelchair. This person had applied online for so many volunteering roles without success, but they were able to gain a meaningful role with a not-for-profit, and this has changed that volunteer's life. Now, that wouldn't have happened if we didn't have the volunteer resource centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The VRC helped to identify suitable volunteer roles for a recently unemployed 27-year-old former baker, who was struggling to move into retail without having retail experience. The VRC provided referrals, it provided introductions. It supported a socially isolated person in their 60s who was seeking skills, confidence, and online awareness to re-enter the workforce independently. It identified volunteer roles, contacted organisations and guided them through online requirements and paperwork. It referred a young person with mental health issues by identifying roles aligned with their interests and referral to an organisation it knew would be supportive. That young person is loving their life and is loving the work they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Southern Volunteering is just one of these VRCs around the country that's facing closure. How shameful would it be that they have to close just because of $3.4 million of funding that they receive annually? That's small change in the federal budget, yet we know these organisations do a power of good and really make every dollar count like it's $10. If we don't provide this support to these organisations, this very small amount of government funding, how can we then say that we really do value volunteering? Money talks, and, really, $3.4 million is such a small amount. I urge the government to reconsider this funding cut in this federal budget, because if we say we support volunteering and we value volunteers, let's put our money where our mouth is. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year whilst out campaigning for the election, the now Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, told Australians:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We should regard people's access to mental health care as no different to if someone who breaks an arm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He pledged to further focus on mental health. Yet what we have seen since from the Albanese government is a direct shift against one of the core pillars of evidence-based medicine, moving away from the science in terms of policymaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading research highlights psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, require more than the average number of sessions to provide the necessary care. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reports 10 sessions will not treat many mental health issues. In fact, extensive international research tells us around one in 10 patients simply can't improve with just 10 psychology sessions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Better </span><span style="font-style:italic;">access</span> report conducted by the government indicates that people with more severe symptoms access more services and subsequently show the most significant improvement. Completely disregarding the evidence is not a solution. It's not the solution for a mum from Glenmore Park, in my electorate of Lindsay, who is scared that her daughter will not be able to access a full 20 Medicare subsidised psychology sessions that were previously available to her before this government halved the sessions on 1 January this year. This is not the solution for almost half of young women aged 16 to 24 who have experienced mental health issues in the past financial year. This is not the solution for one in five Australians who will suffer from mental illness in any given year. Simply put, it is not the solution that Australians deserve. The government is now reducing accessibility while misleading the public that it genuinely believes it is strengthening mental health care, stating that it is only helping the wealthy. These are not high-income people, hogging the sessions and leaving nothing for others, as health minister Mark Butler has argued. These are everyday Australians in need, and the Albanese government is turning its back on them without an alternative plan to support the mental health of Australians who access Medicare funded psychology sessions each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the advice. Australian Psychological Society President Dr Catriona Davis-McCabe said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government commissioned Better Access evaluation released today found workforce shortages and location as key barriers to patient care which makes the axing of the additional sessions program harder to understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This program safely gave many people telehealth or in-person psychological care for the first time in their lives, yet many patients will now have to ration or stop treatment altogether.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just as people shouldn't be asked to ration vital medicines like insulin, they shouldn't have to ration mental health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a similar sentiment with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who when he was in Tasmania before the election deceived the general public about strengthening mental health care. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we should regard people's access to mental healthcare as no different from if someone breaks an arm—they expect to get treated by a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> also reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mental Health Australia chair Matt Berriman said the cut to Medicare-subsidised psychology sessions had raised broader concerns about the mental health system. He challenged the government to reveal its longer-term plan for the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We need added services and action yesterday, not less," Berriman said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"The new government should make mental health a key priority, which has seemed to have been lost since taking power. Where's Labor's plan for mental health in this country?"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further backing the outcry, in a letter to the Minister for Health, Mark Butler, the Australian Psychological Society, Rural Health Alliance, Victorian Ambulance Union and the Australian Federal Police Association all united against the cuts, shining a light on the additional non-direct pressures this decision will place on the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy behind this decision is its untimeliness. When Australians are most vulnerable, recovering after the years of the COVID pandemic; when people have been hit by multiple flood events, multiple fires and other natural disasters; the Albanese government has decided that the Medicare funded sessions that provide so much support to so many Australians are unnecessary. At a time when suicides are rising and the mental health epidemic is worsening, the question is: is the government listening to Australians at all?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I'm so grateful for the opportunity to speak about our nation's mental health. This is an issue that's way too important to be political. An Australian Bureau of Statistics report found that eight Australians, the majority of whom are men, die every day by suicide. Over 65,000 Australians attempt suicide each year. This is a devastating impact on a personal, social and economic scale. That report came out before COVID, and we know that COVID has exacerbated the already existing mental health crisis, so there's no doubt that this is a national emergency. As such, we must ensure that the services we provide are targeted, achieve the desired results and are evidence-based and—very important—independent. I would like to stress the word 'independent'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evaluation by the University of Melbourne of the Better Access initiative showed that the current scheme is not delivering for all Australians equally. It found that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds; those living in regional, rural, and remote areas; and aged-care residents are missing out. The evaluation also found that the additional sessions were generally not targeted to people with complex mental health issues. Research consistently shows that COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted disadvantaged Australians, but evidence from the evaluation indicated these people, who are already doing it tough, are often unable to receive mental health support under Better Access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, Australians used five sessions on average, and 83 per cent of people used 10 or fewer sessions. In addition, wait times to see a professional blew out. The evaluation found that all the additional services went to existing patients, and the number of new patients who were able to get into the system and get access to psychology services declined by seven per cent. This independent assessment has been supported by other experts in the field. For example, Professor Patrick McGorry agreed with the independent assessment in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> in December last year:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He said while there was a "small group of people that for which an extra 10 sessions would be helpful", the extra sessions amounted to a "really weak and inadequate" second-tier solution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, Professor Sam Harvey, executive director and chief scientist at the Black Dog Institute, said that the changes being proposed 'could see shorter waiting times and more people able to make appointments'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll say it again: our nation's mental health is too important to play politics with. I get many calls from people in my electorate, as many do in this place, who are desperate because they can't access services. We all want to do all we can to ensure that our investment in mental health gets to the people who need it. That's why we're tackling this problem in a number of ways. Gap fees are at an all-time high. People are paying more for their care, and when they can't afford those fees they go without. This is why we're undertaking a reform of Medicare—to ensure that people are not shut out of getting help because they can't afford it. This is also why we invested an additional $114 million for mental health services in the October budget. It's an extra $114 million for mental health, which included $48 million to reinstate a loading to make telehealth psychiatry more affordable for people in rural and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also why we have convened a forum of key experts and people with lived experience of mental illness. The aim is to assess the recommendations of the independent evaluation and provide reform advice on how to improve Better Access so that all Australians have access to the same level of evidence based care. Discussions at the forum focused on how to make services more affordable and accessible to those who need them most as part of a broader system of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too many people are struggling with mental health issues. We see it every day. It is our duty to ensure that the services we provide are appropriate, accessible to everyone who needs them and targeted. We must ensure that we grow the services that exist, but in a targeted way for those people that need them most.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I rise in support of this motion, and I congratulate the member for Lindsay, who is doing a terrific job in holding this government to account as the shadow assistant minister for mental health. In my electorate of Fisher, mental health issues have consistently been identified among the community's greatest concerns. According to the 2021 census data, it was the No. 1 health concern for men and women under the age of 55. The mental health and wellbeing of Australians should be a core priority for any government. I was proud to have played a role in a coalition government delivering record investment into mental health and suicide prevention. It was a $3 billion package, and I want to congratulate the great work that David Coleman and Greg Hunt did when they were in their respective roles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to mental health, we can't just measure in money invested. We have to look at the real-life outcomes for everyday Australians. On that metric, it is clear that the coalition is on the side of Australians. Let's take a look just at my electorate of Fisher. Since my election in 2016, I've fought to boost mental health services and outcomes. I've made it my ambition to see the Sunshine Coast become a hub for world-class mental health care. We've delivered $11.4 million to establish and deliver mental health and suicide prevention research and training through the University of the Sunshine Coast's Thompson Institute, and $8.3 million to establish a national PTSD centre, also at the USC's Thompson Institute. It is a research and clinical services centre—the first of its kind in Australia. We delivered $7.3 million to establish and deliver world-class treatment at Wandi Nerida, Australia's first residential eating disorder facility, a facility which I was advised today may have to close by the end of this year, because this federal government will not continue the funding that we made when we set it up. I will say more about that in days to come. We delivered around $4 million to create a brand-new headspace in Caloundra to support the growing population of youth and young adults in the area; over $200,000 to support endED in their eating disorder recovery and rehabilitation efforts; and hundreds of thousands of dollars for men's sheds, mental health research, veteran support and volunteer mental health training. That is the coalition's record on mental health just in my electorate of Fisher: supporting vulnerable Australians, transforming the way we treat mental illnesses and saving lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In less than a year, the Albanese Labor government have delivered cuts, cuts and more cuts to mental health care. We wanted a veterans' wellbeing centre on the Sunshine Coast. We wanted to deliver this. Labor said no. We committed $10 million to Fortem Australia, an organisation doing exemplary work supporting first responders with mental health support. Labor axed $7½ million in funding, meaning that Fortem would not be able to open their outreach programs across regional Australia, including on the Sunshine Coast. It was not until and after sustained advocacy from members of the coalition that we were able to embarrass this government into reversing their cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, while the country contends with a myriad of mental health concerns beyond COVID lockdowns, and in the face of a cost-of-living crisis, Labor has done the unthinkable: they have cut funding to Medicare for mental health care. They have slashed funding for psychologist visits by half. They claim it's based on independent evaluation of the Better Access initiative, but it's as if they didn't even bother to read the report which, at recommendation 12, recommends that they keep the additional 10 sessions in place. Nothing to see here. This is just so typical of this Labor government. They slash and they cut. They throw up smoke and mirrors and echo vacuous promises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make it my mission to ensure that this government, at the very least, continues to match the funding that we provided, particularly in relation to eating disorders. This health minister seems to be totally deaf when it comes to significant and complex mental health care. It is one of my jobs to ensure that he continues this funding; it is vital for Australians, and we will hold his feet to the fire.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion moved in the name of the member for Lindsay. I do not speak against a motion like this lightly. On such serious subject matters, mainly that of mental health, I am sure this motion was not moved with any animus or craven intentions. I am sure that this was not an exercise in political pointscoring. I am sure that we are all better than that. This is why I am not making such an argument here today. I note that the member for Lindsay went before the House last week and asked a question of the Prime Minister, which was subsequently answered by the Minister for Health and Aged Care. It was resoundingly similar to the tone of her motion, yet we hear we are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lindsay would now know that the previous government put in place a number of measures that would expire after the election. One notable example is the fuel excise. Another example is the extension of additional Medicare subsidised sessions through the Better Access initiative, which is the basis of this motion. The member for Lindsay states in her motion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… serious mental health issues are often at their highest two to three years after a crisis, pandemic or natural disaster …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, still, the motion remains entirely silent on the fact that the Morrison government, in the previous parliament, a parliament that the member for Lindsay was part of, opted to make these additional Medicare subsidised sessions under the Better Access scheme merely temporary measures. You would not have seen that mentioned in the headlines of the media releases or press conferences from the now former member for Flinders, but these measures, like his political career, were not intended to see out 2022. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure whether the former member's political career was cut short by circumstance or by design, but the temporary measures that increased subsidised visits through the Better Access scheme were most definitely by design. I'm sure that if the Morrison government had been re-elected at the last election the member for Lindsay would have been the first one into this place, into her party room, using lines like those she has used in her motion, such as 'prioritising their budget over the health and wellbeing of Australians' or 'using an independent evaluation to defend ripping away mental health support'. To be fair, I was paraphrasing slightly, but in essence that is what the member for Lindsay has put to this place. I would like to hope that, upon learning that the previous government put a clock on these extra sessions, the member was as strong and full throated in her defence of those extra sessions to the decision-makers at its inception and not completely silent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth mentioning that the member for Lindsay has used the word 'disingenuous' in her motion, levelling it against the government. Language is very important. I do recognise that the member for Lindsay is the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, and I hope that, through her advocacy, she can help make a positive contribution in this space. But, at present, this contribution appears somewhat disjointed. The member for Lindsay appears to applaud the legacy of the previous Morrison Liberal government whilst, at the same time, lambasting the Albanese Labor government for decisions that were made by the very same government that she was quick to praise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government sought expert medical advice to evaluate the Better Access initiative. The evaluations sung the praises of the initiative itself for those who are able to access it and benefit from it. What the member for Lindsay does not emphasise is the inequality in this scheme for young people, First Nations people, people from rural and regional areas and people from low-income households, many from my electorate of Spence, who fit these categories quite prominently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to mental health, we as a nation cannot afford to leave tens of thousands of vulnerable people out in the cold, when we should be striving for equality. We cannot say that leaving people behind in a system that is working well for some qualifies as a success story. I'm glad the Minister for Health, along with the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, has as recently as 30 January held a forum with clinicians and with people who have lived experience of mental ill health, with the remit of working out how to bring equity and fairness back into treatment and access to treatment, as it should be. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  Before I begin today I want to take a moment to encourage anyone who is triggered by anything I say from this point forward to please reach out to those you trust and love or, alternatively, to one of a number of excellent services that are there to support people experiencing mental distress. They include Kids Helpline, on 1800551800; Lifeline, on 131114; and Beyond Blue, on 1300224636.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that said, I stand before you today as a passionate advocate for youth in Australia and in particular for youth mental health. Throughout my career and since being elected to parliament, a primary focus for me has been trying to build greater support for vulnerable young Australians who are facing mental distress. It devastates me that youth mental ill health in Australia has reached unprecedented levels, with the most recent ABS data showing that two out of five young Australians between the ages of 16 and 24 have experienced a mental health disorder in just the last year. Devastatingly, suicide remains the leading cause of death for young people in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, then, the beginning of End Youth Suicide Week today provides us with an important opportunity to stop and reflect on what role those of us in this place can play in improving the circumstances of young people. This campaign, driven by a number of organisations, including the incredible team at Youth Insearch, encourages our community and young people to defy the stigma associated with mental illness and openly talk about suicide with their friends, families and communities. There are many factors that can bring someone to this position, including social isolation, relationship breakdown, trauma and even the rising cost of living. While all of it is understandable, the loss of even one life due to it is unacceptable. Behind the numbers are real people: young Australians who have incredible futures ahead of them and who deserve access to the support they need to live out their potential. And while this crisis unfolds, the health sector carries a growing burden as it awaits the fulfilment of a promise for system-wide mental health reform in Australia. Whilst I support talk by the government of reform, and understand that such reform takes time, immense resources and sensitivity to the issues, we need to start seeing it roll out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement outlines the shared intention of all governments to work in partnership to improve the mental health of all Australians, while the Vision 2030 Blueprint for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention provides a blueprint for a successful, connected, mental health and suicide prevention system to meet the needs of all Australians. Both of these strategies are welcome. But we desperately need to move beyond good intentions and towards tangible interventions that meet young people in the space where they need to be met, by ensuring we know what services are needed, where and by whom, and then by working to provide those services in a way that is infinitely accessible to all, regardless of where the person lives or their socioeconomic or cultural status or background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do better, and I call on the government to take tangible action today. I stress the urgency of the situation that is faced by the health sector in this waiting game. In 2022, more than one in three of those diagnosed with a mental health disorder and aged between 16 and 34 had not had their counselling needs met. In November last year, I questioned the government on their plans to cut support for subsidised mental health sessions by half in 2023, and I continue to condemn the government's decision to move forward with that. Chronic mental health conditions need more than 10 quick appointments. We need a system that is mobilised around the individual's needs, rather than one that is curtailed by an arbitrary number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government introduced 20 Medicare-subsidised sessions available to young people, purposefully in response to the prevalence of mental ill-health in the country. With the crisis only worsening, young people must be able to access the mental health service they need. I disagree with the government's independent evaluation of the Better Access initiative to defend their decision to take away this mental health support from young Australians, and I continue to argue it's not justified. The urgency of the situation does not allow for the budget to be prioritised above the health and wellbeing of young Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking with people at the coalface of this challenge across our community has shown me that we have the information and innovation needed to make the necessary long-term improvements to the mental health of young Australians. We just need the political will. It is time to prioritise the system-wide health reforms promised by the government to ensure our nation remains the best country in the world for all Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  Mental health is a crucial issue that affects the wellbeing of all Australians, and I am proud to say that this government is taking a comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing this crucial issue. In recent years, the prevalence of mental illness has increased dramatically, and it is more important than ever that we take steps to rectify the delivery of mental health services in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government recognises the impact that mental illness can have on individuals, families and our entire community. We are committed to providing the necessary resources, support and funding to ensure everyone can access the mental health care they need. Putting the voices of experts, carers and consumers at the front and centre of policy development and decision-making is essential to delivering the mental health system Australians deserve. To achieve this, the government has worked closely with stakeholders across the mental health sector to ensure the people of this country have the resources and support they need to receive the best possible care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crucial step in reviewing the government's mental health and suicide prevention policies was the Better Access Forum. This forum followed the release of the independent Better Access evaluation by the University of Melbourne, which showed that, while the program delivered promising outcomes, many Australians continued to miss out. For example: in 2022, less than half of the people from low socioeconomic backgrounds, like many of those who live in my electorate of Holt, were able to access the treatment they needed, despite most services being delivered in their areas. This forum, which demonstrated this government's cornerstone cooperative approach, focused on improving the system's equity and aimed to understand how Australia could improve access to care without compromising positive health outcomes. It recognised the shared goals of the government, the mental health sector and those with a lived experience, and the mutual commitment to work together to continue building an inclusive mental health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The forum was also informed of the decision by the Minister for Health and Aged care, Mark Butler, MP, to announce a significant $8.5 million investment to support those with a lived and living experience of mental ill-health to shape the policies and programs that affect them. This includes $7.5 million to establish and operate two independent national mental health lived-experienced peak bodies, one representing consumers and the other representing carers, families and kin. Additionally, the government will give lived-experience Australians an extra $900,000 to continue their work in leading lived-experience research and to build the capacity of consumers and carers. The remaining $100,000 will help to establish a regular stakeholder forum to increase transparency, accountability and partnership with the sector. This demonstrates the Albanese Labor government's emphasis on constant and continuous improvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evaluation found that people using Better access experienced positive outcomes but that those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, or those living in regional, rural or remote communities, were missing out. This meant that the Australians most at risk were also those who were unable to access the care they needed and deserved. These alarming findings informed Minister Butler's considered decision not to prolong the temporary Better Access expansion beyond 31 December 2022, and to encourage the government to focus on making the system more equitable. An equitable system means that communities facing socioeconomic disadvantage, like the people of Holt, can have faith that this country's mental health system cares for them too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud that the Albanese Labor government understands the importance of mental health and wellbeing, and is committed to improving mental health support for all Australians. I commend Minister Butler and the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, MP, for working tirelessly to ensure that everyone has access to the care they need.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Lindsay for moving this motion, particularly at this time. Today is the first day of End Youth Suicide Week, an initiative of Youth Insearch, which works to raise awareness, overcome stigma and, hopefully, provide support to those who need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been talking with the people of Wentworth over the summer, and youth mental health is one of the most common concerns people raise with me. It's not just young people who raise it: youth mental health is frequently raised by older people, who are desperately worried about their children, their grandchildren and the young people in their communities. During the election, a number of people came up to me personally and told me about their own mental health journeys. A young man in particular came to talk to me and asked me about what I was doing in terms of supporting young men. We had a hard conversation about the impact of mental health on young men in particular, the alarming suicide rates, his own personal journey of dealing with the suicides of his friends and his own mental health. Sadly, the statistics really speak for themselves. Over the last decade, the suicide rate for people aged 18 to 24 went from 10.8 per 100,000 to 14.6, an increase of more than one third. For people in the 18 to 24 age group, suicide accounts for around one third of all deaths. It is the leading cause of death in that age group, and that is much, much too high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The subject of today's motion is the government's decision to reduce the number of Medicare subsidised mental health sessions from 20 to 10. I have raised this with the minister directly, and I would like to thank him publicly for taking the time to meet with me to discuss this and other issues on several occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I understand it, the government accepted the findings of research done by the University of Melbourne, which found that there was a lack of equity in the Better Access initiative, with people from more affluent areas receiving more support than those from less affluent areas. Research also found that those with more complex mental health issues were not receiving sufficient support. It is quite reasonable for the government to target its limited resources to where it can do the most good. I accept that principle and advocate for it being adopted more widely, but the economic impacts and the community impacts of mental health are significant. The 2020 Productivity Commission estimated that the benefits would be more than $18 billion per year. That is more than the value of our wheat exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The value of effective mental health programs is enormous. The impact on our communities when a young person makes the most awful decision for them in their lives is absolutely brutal, and no money can put a value on that. Rather than cutting back on Better Access because of equity and complexity issues, we should be building on it and developing additional solutions that are targeted to those groups which are missing out, such as low-income individuals, those in regional areas and those with complex mental health conditions. Mental health support should not be a zero-sum game, where funding is taken from one group and given to another. We have to improve results across the community and find innovative ways of delivering services, rather than rationing services for some despite the positive and demonstrated impacts of that support. So I call on the government to reconsider this decision: restore the additional mental health sessions and make mental health and suicide prevention an absolute priority for this parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I thank the member for Lindsay for putting forward this motion. The Albanese Labor government understands the importance of mental health and how the various aspects of an individual's life can affect their mental wellbeing. We know that early intervention and support are key to promoting positive mental health, and we are investing in innovative and compassionate projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month, the Albanese government has invested $1.7 million to extend The Essential Network, or TEN project. This project, facilitated by the Black Dog Institute, provides tailored mental health and wellbeing support to healthcare professionals, including through clinical interventions, peer support, self-guided check-ups and digital programs. It has helped more than 86,000 health professionals across Australia. It is vital that we support our healthcare workers, who have always been there to care for us. The Albanese government is also investing $203 million this year in the rollout of the Student Wellbeing Boost for every school and student across the country. On average, each school will get $20,000, depending on its need and size. In addition to the boost, all Australian education ministers have signed a new five-year $307 million Federation Funding Agreement to deliver the National Student Wellbeing Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in my electorate of Cunningham, there are some absolutely outstanding local initiatives that are shining a light on mental health. Last year, on Christmas Day, the member for Wollongong, Paul Scully, and I spent some time visiting some amazing businesses and organisations that opened their doors to ensure that no-one was left alone on what can be a very isolating day. We started our day at The Foundery in Port Kembla, where their volunteers joined forces with the Salvation Army to provide a special Christmas brunch for those looking for a friendly face. Local business owners Wayne and Jane from Tonitto Continental Cakes donated some amazing pastries and cakes from their shop across the street. There was even enough left over to take to our second stop of the day, the One Door Wollongong and Illawarra Clubhouse. One Door Mental Health Wollongong provides specialised mental health services to the Illawarra region, including centre based services, one-on-one support and assistance in transitioning to the NDIS. Here we caught up with Shannon, who is a fierce advocate for fixing the NDIS, having attended local rallies and campaigns for many years. It was great to spend time with participants and carers alike, who were able to spend the holiday with those who simply understood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank my good friend Janine Cullen and Clifford Jackson, Donna Walker and Artemis Atkinson for their dedication to supporting and promoting mental health in our community. Mental illnesses can be severely exacerbated during the holiday period, and I thank these volunteers for recognising that support should be a priority during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To end the day, we stopped at His Boy Elroy, in Wollongong, who, along with their associated mental health initiative, the Barstool Brothers, provided a free burger to anyone who had nowhere else to go. To Lachie, Daniel and Selena, thank you so much for giving up your day to cook for, converse with and support those who really needed it. I also thank Zweefers cake shop for donating dessert for the occasion. It was truly heartwarming to see so many local businesses joining forces to make Christmas Day so special for those around them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me to not mention the Barstool Brothers and not highlight another amazing new venture they are about to undertake—these guys are amazing. The Barstool Brothers community initiative has seen their local member base grow to over 1,500 men, and it continues to grow through the running of multiple free social events every month, with a focus on helping to facilitate relationship growth and support between men. In less than a month, their members will tackle the Kokoda Trail, documenting the journey while producing a film that they hope will inspire, educate, and reassure men battling mental health that they are not alone. The group going to Kokoda plans to be open and vulnerable about their mental health battles, in what they hope will be an extremely raw look at the struggles that men can face, quite often in silence. They will also be exploring the traits that our heroic diggers encapsulated, such as mateship, resilience, and courage, and how they relate to modern day men and the values that Australians are proud to be known for.</span>

Since the last election, parliament has successfully introduced the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which is an incredible achievement, but this is only the start when it comes to building integrity into our political system. Australians deserve to be able to trust not only their politicians but also the institutions that underpin our democracy and the decisions that stem from them. As the Grattan Institute reveals, all too often government institutions are stacked with party-friendly appointments made at the discretion of the relevant minister. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Independent member of parliament, I believe it is my job to hold this government to account. The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2022 is soon to be introduced. I support this important initiative as it will help transform and futureproof Australia's industry and economy. However, one aspect of the bill troubles me. The government tells us that the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation will be managed by an independent board. This board will be charged with making $11 billion of investment decisions over several years. But what does it mean when the government says the board will be 'independent'? How will board members be appointed? Clause 18 of the proposed bill states, 'Board members are to be appointed by the ministers by written instrument— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For 10 years, there have been thousands of people who came to Australia seeking protection and refuge locked in a state of uncertainty, deprived of access to basic services and achingly separated from family and, in many cases, separated from their children. </span>

It is awful that another four years have passed. It is enormously welcome that today we are delivering on our commitment to end that punishing limbo. I thank the Minister for Home Affairs and, in particular, the immigration minister for their work and dedication to achieving that commitment in a careful but urgent manner. I also want to acknowledge the incredible effort by the refugee and asylum seeker support community in my electorate and around Australia for years and years. Your advocacy has been absolutely vital—your work in supporting the lives and hopes of people who have suffered through the TPV and SHEV nightmare has been a lifesaving labour of love. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Last week was quite the week for great media reveals of previously undisclosed donations to political parties and campaigns. On Thursday we heard that Sportsbet, one of Australia's gambling giants, had donated $19,000 to the Minister for Communications, who oversees the regulation of gambling. On Friday, the ABC revealed that Hancock Prospecting, controlled by Australia's richest person, who resides in my electorate, Gina Rinehart, donated an undisclosed $300,000 to the Liberal Party over the last two years. This enormous sum was undisclosed because it was transferred by a third party, the Sydney Mining Club. It seems likely that it was transferred in this way so it could remain undisclosed. This sum is more than the total that Hancock Prospecting has declared in donations to all political parties since 1988. Who knows if there is more. So the question asked of the Minister for Communications on Thursday can be asked again today of the Liberal Party. What influence has this hidden donation brought? What deal was made between Ms Rinehart, the Sydney Mining Club and the Liberal Party for the receipt of this money? How can we have a democracy that acts in the interests of its people if big business can secretly buy favours? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community demands more. If there is a loophole in Australia's disclosure laws that allows $300,000 in secret donations, the law needs to change. </span>

Located in Edinburgh, the National Military Vehicle Museum was opened back in 1993 in Port Adelaide, but it eventually found its way back up into to the northern suburbs of Adelaide in the heart of the Edinburgh Defence Precinct. The museum is run by the Military Vehicle Preservation Society of South Australia, whose volunteers keep the museum alive.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just vehicles that are a drawcard to the National Military Vehicle Museum, for their building houses a remarkable collection of signals equipment, with its oldest piece being a kerosene signal lamp that would have been in use during the Boer War. That's quite remarkable. Given that RAAF Base Edinburgh is home to the Defence Science and Technology Group, I'm sure some of our current serving personnel are just as engrossed by the collection as I am, if not more so. The magic of the National Military Vehicle Museum was first shown to me by a gentleman called Jeff Pinney, who has been a volunteer there for quite some time. Jeff spent his working life at GM Holden up in the northern suburbs of Adelaide for 36 years and 17 serving in the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles). Thank you, Jeff, and everyone at the museum who has indulged my curiosity and love of the military museum.</span>

Our own local elder Aunty Barbara Simms stepped up on the stage and shared her story. Her story moved me. Aunty Barbara told us how she was forcibly taken from her home in La Perouse, where she lived with her mother and father, when she was just eight years old. Her three brothers and sisters were also taken away. Imagine an eight-year-old child today, a primary school age child, being taken from their family. It's unthinkable.</span>

I, for one, am humbled by her words. She is a woman of strength and resilience. She is an inspiration to all Australians, past, present and future. First Nations people are the original storytellers, and I want to thank Aunty Barbara for sharing her story. Your words are truly words of wisdom, thank you.</span>

I have attended this event many times in past years, but this was the first time in my capacity as the member for Cunningham.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lunar New Year, also known as Tet, is always a colourful, loud, entertaining and fun event, with so many different performances. There was an abundance of dancing, from traditional Vietnamese dancing through to hip-hop, and a fashion parade with models ranging from toddlers through to a model in her 90s. Ken Habak, the chair of the Multicultural Communities Council of the Illawarra, gave an entertaining speech about the attributes of the cat and what that might mean for the year ahead.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnamese community also conducted a special minute's silence to commemorate veterans who lost their lives in the Vietnam War. The way that this community speaks about their love and admiration for the Australian soldiers who came to help them is just beautiful. Our local Vietnam veterans were represented on the night by Ian Birch and Pam Bowmaker from the Illawarra Vietnam Veterans Association. The Vietnamese community are also the first to put up their hands to help others in need. They have recently fundraised for flood victims across the country and for the humanitarian effort in Ukraine.</span>

Triple H, 100.1 FM, is a much-loved community radio station serving the Hornsby-Ku-ring-gai area. It operates out of the Wallarobba Arts and Cultural Centre in Hornsby.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Finally, upper Blue Mountains residents are going to have the benefit of full-fibre internet as part of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to expanding access to 1.5 million additional premises. This is going to be such welcome news for people in the first areas to be converted from fibre to the node to fibre to the premises. Blackheath, Leura, Wentworth Falls and Katoomba will be upgraded throughout 2024, and there are more announcements to come on the remaining villages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents in these areas have been tied to the old copper network, which can never meet the demands of 21st century connectivity. We were one of the first areas to receive fibre to the node, and the problems with connection and service throughout the rollout and since have demonstrated how inadequate it is. The now Minister for Communications joined me in Blackheath in 2017 to hear about slow speeds and dropouts. And then in November 2021 the now Prime Minister and the minister came to Leura to make the commitment to increase the fibre in the NBN network to start to fix the mess that we had been left with.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reliable internet is more vital than ever before. Families and businesses depend on it. It isn't a luxury; it's an absolute essential. In six years we've seen NBN data use triple, and we don't expect that to slow. This is a big win for the years of struggle for people in the upper mountains.</span>

This was the first time this much loved event was held on the coast. The event coincided with the official opening of the Devonport Waterfront Precinct. This important $17 million redevelopment was made possible by a $10 million investment from the former Liberal government. I couldn't be more proud to be the member for Braddon who oversaw the delivery of this transformational project for the people of Devonport and everyone who visits this great city. The spectacular park includes a children's play area, barbecues, an amphitheatre and an events precinct, all surrounded by native Tasmanian paintings and art. This incredible 160-metre-long elevated walkway that juts out into the beautiful Mersey River will no doubt become yet another iconic Devonport landmark.</span>

What an amazing site Devonport's Living City is developing into. Thanks to the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra for bringing your wonderful music and talents to our regions. I look forward to future concerts across the north-west, the west coast and King Island in the great state of Tasmania.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Thanks to two great Labor governments, the Albanese federal government and the Andrews state government, there are now 55,000 fee-free TAFE places available in Victoria, and people in my community are jumping aboard this opportunity. I encourage everyone: If you've been thinking about studying something new or upskilling, now is the time. Local fee-free TAFE and vocational education and training courses are open for enrolment, and this is your opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria we have job vacancies for bar attendants and baristas, advertising and marketing professionals, education aides, social workers, database and system administrators, and ICT security specialists. You can now study these occupations for free at Chisholm TAFE. And where else would you go? We are seeing shortages in the aged-care sector, in the care sector more broadly, in agriculture, in construction, in hospitality and tourism, in technology and in sovereign capability in manufacturing. We as a government want to deliver skilled workers at a time of acute skill shortages. We need that in Victoria, and you can do that at the wonderful Chisholm TAFE. There are students like Remy, who I met on my most recent visit to Frankston TAFE, who is studying nursing. She's getting the skills to look after people in hospitals and aged care. And if you want to look after people, there's an opportunity for you, too.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  The federal Labor government has cut $150 million from the Safer Communities Fund, a program that was used by the previous government to deliver CCTV cameras in my community of the Redlands. The program was designed to assist communities to feel safe by reducing crime and addressing antisocial behaviour. A Liberal and Nationals government utilised the fund to deliver some much needed CCTV cameras around the Redlands, and I was hoping to utilise it to continue to deliver even more. Redlands City Council was the beneficiary of two grants totalling over $110,000. The funding provided for 31 CCTV cameras in known hotspots such as Capalaba Place and Weinam Creek ferry terminal and car park at Redland Bay. Since their introduction, Weinam Creek has seen a reduction in auto crimes and antisocial behaviour. Many Bay Islands residents have reported to me that they now feel a lot safer at night as they park, make their way to their vehicles and await their ferries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CCTV initiatives were the result of a collaboration between council, police, and the state and federal governments. Through local business input and community feedback, they identified known trouble spots where the cameras would be most effective. I was hoping to utilise the funding to deliver new CCTV cameras at Cleveland Point and other local hooning hotspots. During the election campaign we committed to invest $175,000 for this purpose. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to reverse this decision and restore the funding that has served my community so well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (McEwen) (16:29):</span>  We all know about the famous exploits of the member for Hume, the now shadow Treasurer, and his blatant decision to deliberately hide electricity price rises from the Australian people during the last election. But I was astounded to read over the weekend that evidence has emerged that the former energy minister was not alone in hiding this information. As reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer—who are all the same person—and his mate Frydenberg were in cahoots with the member for Hume to make this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't get me wrong; I'm not astounded that the former PM and Treasurers were both involved, but seeing it was an absolute revelation. Answers to questions on notice by PM&amp;C show the former Prime Minister was told by the former Treasurer—not him, the other one—that he had given the member for Hume the power to hide the price rises. And that's just what he did. On 7 April 2022, he changed the regulations and put off the notification of the price rises until the week after the election—a deliberate strategy to lie to the Australian people. And then the member for Hume has the gall to come into this place and vote against our energy plans. He stuffed up the energy market not once but 21 times and made us vulnerable to the international shocks that we're now experiencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If he cared about it, and if those opposite cared about it, they would come in, redo it and vote for household assistance. Shame on them. It's time that the members for Hume and Cook followed their mate Frydenberg and got out of here.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Ethan Parry is one of our Local Sporting Champion grant recipients, and he'll be representing Australia later this year at the 2023 Virtus Global Games in France. The Virtus Games are usually held in the year preceding the Paralympics. He proudly competed for Queensland and Australia last year, and he won gold medals at the state titles for the 100-metre race and the long jump. But listen to this for a haul, Madam Deputy Speaker. He then competed for Australia, for the second time, at the Oceania Asia Games, and he brought home three golds: the 200-metre race; the tri event, which consists of the 100-metre race, the long jump and the shot put; and the 4 x 100 metre relay, where our boys also secured a world record. He then won two silver medals, for the 100-metre race and the long jump, and Ethan also set new Australian records in the 200-metre race and the long jump. He's coached by Daniel Parker, who's better known as 'Stix'. Stix is a veteran who won gold and silver medals at both the '17 and '18 Invictus Games.</span>

This is a fantastic program, that helps with the sometimes significant expenses for local athletes, coaches and officials, aged 12 to 18, to take part in state, national and international competitions. But what a champion Ethan Parry is—what an incredible haul and what a unique individual out there flying the green and gold for Australia. I say to Ethan: you go get 'em!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Names such as Brabham, Brock, Doohan, Johnson, Lowndes, Maddison, Reid, Webber, Ricardo, Price—these are the legends of Australian motorsport. They have more in common than just their immense driving talent. Their incredible achievements were made possible by the amazing support base that is the Australian motorsport industry, and I'd like to thank that the outset my co-chair, the member for Solomon, and also the other members contributing to this debate, the members for Wide Bay and Herbert and also the members for McEwen and Hasluck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Motorsport Australia, the peak body for motorsport in the country, estimates that more than 180,000 Australians make a significant contribution to the sport every year. Through the incredibly wide variety of racing styles, categories and competitions, motorsports are deeply ingrained in the Australian sporting landscape. This popularity correlates to almost 47,000 direct and indirect jobs, with almost 19,000 volunteers supporting them, be it as team mechanics, race stewards or race day staff, allowing so many young Australians to get a start in the sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From this activity, the economic activity of motorsports cannot be underestimated. It is estimated that motorsports contribute $8.6 billion to the economy every year, and Queensland is home to a significant proportion of this economic import. Forde is home or neighbour to some of the best businesses in the motor racing industry in this country. Dick Johnson Racing, Shell V-Power Racing Team, is the premier Ford Mustang outfit in the Repco Supercars Championship. Based at Stapylton, the legendary team has seen a recent run of race wins and championships under the able leadership of Dr Ryan Story. Now, under Team Principal Ben Croke, the 2023 season is being looked forward to with great relish. Recently they unveiled their new Shell V-Power gen-3 Mustang GT, which will make its debut in the first race of the season, in the streets of Newcastle in March.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interest of balance, on the other side of the Ford Holden rivalry is Matt Stone Racing, the truck-assist racing team, competing through a number of categories, including the Supercars Championship, Dunlop Super2 Series V8 and V8 utes. This team is based at Yatala. This year will be historic for the truck-assist racing team and the championship as the Commodore era has ended and we see the replacement of the Commodores with the gen 3 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, which will be driven by drivers Jack Le Brocq and Cameron Hill. I wish both Shell V-Power and the truck-assist racing teams all the best for the 2023 season.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at motorsports more generally, we get caught up in the big end of town—the V8 Supercars, Formula 1 and those sort of events—but it's also important to recognise the local events that occur in our electorates. There are events such as the racing events at the Kingston Park Raceway, which is our premier go-karting facility in the City of Logan and one of the premier facilities in South-East Queensland, and Mount Cotton Hillclimb, a hill climbing circuit run by the MG Car Club of Queensland, just outside of my electorate, in the electorate of Bowman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, when we look at the young people and those looking to get a start in motorsports so they can enjoy a day out, there is racing at Slideways Go Karting World, at Pimpama. Groups such as the Gold Coast Motocross Club in Yatala have been providing key developments through coaching, practice and local racing sessions. Interestingly, with many of these clubs we're finding that, as the urban footprint encroaches on those clubs, the ability for them to do what they enjoy doing every day gets more and more difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look to the future, we see a landscape changing rapidly across the globe in the motor racing industry. With the uptake of electric vehicles, the grassroots racing landscape will also change dramatically in the coming decade. With new cars entering the market, new racing categories will also present themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Solomon as my co-chair as we continue to work with the motor racing industry to look forward to these great opportunities. Whether it is touring cars, open wheels, rally or any of the other competitive motorsports, we look forward to the wonderful work they will continue to do in the years to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I second the motion and am very happy to speak. I want to start by thanking my friend, the member for Forde, for approaching me to be the co-chair for the Parliamentary Friends of Motorsport. I know how important they are to our community and to Australia more broadly. It's great to see him, a former competitor, here in this place. My colleague the member for Hasluck, used to ride bikes, as well as the member for McEwan. And the member for Spence—who's not in here right now—used to race in the past as well. I'm sure there are others in the parliament who once raced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we let people know that we were launching this event, there was a lot of interest and a lot of acknowledgement about how important motorsports are to our nation. It's a massive contributor to the NT economy, and I'm very keen to see it grow. I reject the claims that I hear from some from time to time that it's not a real sport. Anyone who has ever been to a competition knows the skills required and the hard work and athleticism that goes into it—not just by the drivers and the riders but also by their support teams. We thank the volunteers, because it's the volunteers who make it all happen, day after day and week after week, around our great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's entertaining, it's thrilling and it's a huge employer, being an economic boost for our regions. As the member for Forde outlined, the total gross annual output of Australian motorsports is valued at more than $8.6 billion. For the NT, a recent Ernst &amp; Young report put the economic benefit of motorsports to the NT at just under $100 million, but that was without the bikes. When you add in the bikes, the benefit is well over $100 million. It's a huge economic driver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 200,000 Australians participate in motorsports across the board each year, and more than 65,000 people work to make competitions a reality, both in direct jobs and, of course, through those vital unpaid volunteer positions. People do it because they love the sport. It's a sport that inspires a tremendous amount of passion and enthusiasm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing worth noting, as the various competitions travel around the country, is that motorsports inject money and excitement into so many small towns, and that's vital for them. The fans spend money on accommodation, retail, food and drink. The knock-on effects flow through so many other industries and supply chains. From Supercars in Hidden Valley, in my electorate in Darwin and so many other different motorsports in the Northern Territory through to the Red Centre Nats and the Finke Desert Race in the Red Centre, Territorians love our motorsports. When there's a competition on, the whole place buzzes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde and I want to keep that going and build on it to keep building regional Australia. We want to see those jobs and career pathways created for future generations, including for girls and young women—and for men and women of all ages. There's a role for everyone in motorsports. On that note, I visited the Girls on Track training day in Darwin recently and saw how much those young girls and teenagers enjoyed learning about all aspects of motor racing. They really enjoyed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliamentary friendship group that we've launched is national, so I've been really happy to try to help the efforts at Wakefield Park Raceway and get that track up and running again. This Saturday night just past, I was pleased to be down in Alice Springs for the MotorSports NT Awards. On a bipartisan note, the NT sports minister, Kate Worden, and also a member of the opposition in the NT Bill Yan, the member for Namatjira—he has a strong history in motorsports down there in Alice Springs—were there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't got time to go through all the winners in detail, but I do want to acknowledge them quickly. We had: Junior Official of the Year, Chantel Fisher; Junior Rider of the Year, Aiden Blowers; Junior Driver of the Year, River Spitzbarth; Rising Star, Zac Hannon; Volunteer of the Year, Nina Kells; Official of the Year, Jan Cartwright; Administrator of the Year, Gail Kroonstuiver; Rider of the Year, Emma Lavercombe; Driver of the Year, David Ling; Event of the Year, Chariots of Thunder Sprintcar Series; Club Person of the Year, Gail Kroonstuiver; NT Club of the Year, Central Australia Drag Racing Association; and NT Champion of the Year, Emma Lavercombe. It was a great event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on this motion today on motorsports, and I commend both the member for Solomon and the member for Forde for establishing the Parliamentary Friends of Motorsports group. There is nothing more Australian than motorsports. Also I'd like to acknowledge the presence of other motorsports enthusiasts in the chamber, the member for McEwen and the member for Hasluck—particularly the member for Hasluck, who has a far more esteemed and successful on-track motorcycle record than me. I broke my neck in 2021 at Lakeside race track at a series of corners called the bus stop—apparently that's because everyone gets off there! Anyway, I can't remember much of it, but I lived to tell the story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Motorsports are very important in this country. As has been said, nearly 200,000 Australians every week engage in some form of motorsport, and that covers all ages. It covers genders. It covers everything. Everyone gets involved when it comes to motorsports. Not only is it such an inclusive area for us as citizens but also, as has been mentioned, it's a great driver of the economy, with $8.6 billion being injected into the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said there's nothing more Australian than motorsports, and it makes me think about my growing up in Australia in the 1980s, when it was Wayne Gardner on an absolutely maniacal 500cc machine. How anyone rode them, I don't know, but he did it for us, and the nation rode with him when he won his world championship. Then in the nineties we had the incredible Mick Doohan, who followed that through to the four-strokes and to the modern era of Jack Miller and KTM, formerly on Ducati. We've ridden the highs and lows of Australian motorsports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 20 years ago I was a big fan of a fellow called Andy Caldecott. He was an off-road racer of motorbikes, an Australian legend. He won the Australian Safari four times and was a place getter in the Paris to Dakar on motorbikes. I used to wake up every morning to see where Andy had got in the placings. He won a couple of stages. I'll never forget the morning I woke up and heard that unfortunately Andy had lost his life in the race. It was sad. But that's motorsport. It's an expression of freedom. It does come with its risks, but there is a lot more good that comes from motorsports than bad. I say that particularly in that so much of what we rely on today in our motorcars is derived from motorsports. I mention Andy for that reason. Yes, people will tell you it's dangerous. But when you think about tyre technology and when you think about suspension and traction control, you think about what saves us every day. Most of it has been refined in motorsports and has then come down to the everyday road user.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great proving ground, a great place for kids to learn vehicle dynamics. And as with so many areas in life, you find that the kids who have learnt to ride fast on a track don't ride fast on the road. They know that the place to do that is on the track, where the conditions suit what you're doing and all the safety precautions are taken, and they know that. As a former accident investigator who has seen too much death and carnage on the roads, I know that motorsports contribute to lowering the road toll. And if we're to continue with our goal to reaching zero fatalities, motorsports will play a big part in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I will say, long live the combustion engine, and well done to everyone who promotes motorsports in this fine nation of ours. And well done to the member for Forde and the member for Solomon for creating the Parliamentary Friends of Motorsports group.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  It's not often you get to talk about things that you're passionate about and have a lifelong dedication to. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a petrolhead through and through. I want to point out the irony of the member for Forde forgetting Allan Moffat OBE! That's okay, it's a bit of a dig.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Motor racing starts at go-karts and runs all the way through to Formula 1, and I've had the pleasure of being involved with all these sports right across the nation. I had the fun of standing in the starter's box at a Formula 1 race with CAMS, the Confederation of Australian Motorsports. I was able, even in my younger days—and I urge members not to look at this tape—to be at the 1988 Thunderdome where there was a skinny little bloke with curly blonde hair towing the cars off the track as they crashed. I still have Dick Johnson's headlight cover—it's something that was a treasured possession of mine. I am a red team person in politics, but when it comes to cars it's blue team all the way! When you're born in Broadmeadows, you don't have a choice; cars are in your blood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about motorsports, it's great that we come together and talk about this and support it. I want to talk about the serious side of things, such as the jobs and the industry it creates. I remember a friend of mine owned South Side Cylinder Heads in South Melbourne. One of the Formula 1 teams came in needing a particular bracket to be made. He made that bracket quickly and swiftly, picking up that work that led to thousands and thousands of dollars worth of work. Because in Australia we have the ability to manufacture high-quality products in small numbers very quickly. These are the sorts of jobs that people like me—who didn't want to stay at school and become a lawyer—enjoy. We enjoy being able to put together an engine or a gearbox and learning these things. That's why it's important we're talking about free TAFE, getting the motorsports courses to help you develop vehicle engineering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Wide Bay said, we all jump in our cars each and every day. Motorsports have delivered ABS brakes, proper fuel injection, paddle-shift steering and all these things that we take for granted. That all comes from the technology that's put into motorsports. One aspect of motorsports that is not talked about enough—and we're talking about an $8.6 billion a year industry—is drag racing. I want to be very clear. Drag racing is not illegal street racing. They are two totally different things. If you go to a drag racing strip—and I have been to the Willowbank Raceway, and all across Australia except for Perth in my time working on drag racing cars, where we won three Australian championships in the super gas field working for Steve Crook—you know the difference between a professional organisation of people where people come, where drivers get dressed in their fire suits and where safety is the no. 1 thing. You couldn't even get one drop of oil on the track or you were off, because that can lead to catastrophic situations. We've seen that just recently at Willowbank where Sam Fenech lost his life in a terrible accident. Many of my friends knew him personally and are really shattered by it. It was an absolutely terrible accident, and it's something that happens occasionally. Don Watson in 1993 was a bit of a mate, a customer of mine, and the disk brake shattered on his car at Bathurst, and he perished. It was a frightening thing to wake up the next day, look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> and see a picture of Don's car upside down and the carnage that it caused. These things do happen, but for every one of those there is an opportunity where we develop more technology to make it safer, including things like neck braces, which are now mandatory. If you hit a wall at 200 miles an hour you stop pretty quickly and pretty sharply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many businesses have left Victoria and gone to Queensland because of the ability to race at places like Ipswich, because Victoria is the only state that doesn't have a publicly owned and sanctioned international standard drag racing facility. I think that's a bit of a shame that that has happened. To be fair, I think the drag racing fraternity has got to get together and work together to get this happening. When we were racing back in the heyday of the 1990s we had 40,000 or 50,000 people attend a one-day event, and we did that many times. The jobs of the fire crews, the marshals, the volunteers, the ticket sales—all these thing that happen—are why it's important that we keep supporting and promoting motorsports. We get the jobs out of it through TAFE. We get the careers and we get the high-flyers—we have international stars that go around the world doing their best. But, importantly, when we look back it starts with go-karts. If you look at most Formula 1 drivers and the like, and those who have gotten to the V8 supercar pinnacles, they all started their lives with go-karts. It's important we keep supporting motorsports, and I'm glad we're doing it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  Motorsports are in Townsville's DNA. It doesn't matter whether you're a diehard Ford or Holden fan, you can't live in Townsville and not have motorsports impact your life in some way. It might be as simple the yearly Townsville 500 supercars closing the road on your commute to work. Or you might be one of the 145,000 people who attend the three-day event every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very fortunate in Townsville to have played host to the supercars for many years. This not-to-be missed part of our events calendar has been part of our city every year since 2009. Not even the COVID-19 pandemic could stop the event going ahead. In fact, it was only a positive. Queensland was one of the safest bets for organisers to host events because we didn't have the outbreaks, specifically in the north. This led to double-header events in both 2020 and 2021, with an extra round being held in both years on consecutive weekends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reid Park circuit has become one of the country's most well-recognised and respected tracks. It's a favourite among the drivers. It's a hybrid track that has sections that are purpose-built for the event and sections that form part of our regular road network. It has been a happy hunting ground for the Triple Eight race team. Jamie Whincup has recorded 12 individual race wins at the track. Since about 2016 Shane van Gisbergen has been almost unstoppable, with 10 wins to his name. Some of these wins at Reid Park have been etched into motorsports history forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder that motorsports are so important to the people of Townsville. It's a sport that brings people together and brings billions of dollars of economic benefit. It's not unheard of for every single motel and hotel in the town to be completely booked out for the weekend of the race. In fact, one year we built a tent city to accommodate the many people who came to town for the spectacle. That's why I'm very happy to support this motion today. We should be doing everything we can to support this sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's not just the professionals who we're recognising today. It's the grassroots; it's the mums, dads, sons and daughters who spend their weekend at tracks across the country, who are working on cars, motorbikes and carts. It's the ones who travel around in search of the win at racetracks and speedways in regional and rural locations, supporting those towns and cities as they go. It's people like Madison Dunston, a fantastic young woman from Townsville who's put her blood, sweat and tears into working her way to very high-level racing in support categories like the Aussie Racing Cars Championship in the Toyota 86 series. But Madi and her family aren't just focused on themselves; they're always giving back to the community. Her family runs a go-kart track, which also gives at-risk youth an opportunity to learn mechanic skills as part of a federally funded program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, because we have a hybrid racetrack there has been a lack of dedicated facilities for motorsports in the community of Townsville. That's why I fought hard to support DriveIt, a grassroots campaign to build a purpose-built racetrack. Through DriveIt's hard work and advocacy we were able to secure $12 million under the former coalition government to build not just a 2.75-kilometre race circuit, but a driver education complex. I'm very happy to be able to report that just last week the bitumen was completed on the track. This means it won't be long until race meets can take place at the facility. This is a fantastic result, and I can't wait to see what it means for our city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't just be a place for motorsports enthusiasts; it will put in practice their driving. The DriveIt team estimates an economic benefit to the region of around $35 million. At the same time DriveIt offers space for rollover recovery training, light and sirens, driver training for emergency services in a safe environment with plenty of room to move. It's an excellent example of how sport and its facilities can have a huge benefit beyond those who use it for events. I would like to convey my congratulations to Greg Putt and the whole DriveIt team for the amazing work they've done. Motorsports are a key part of our community, and I am very happy to support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  There are a lot of revheads in Australia. In fact, a suburb in my seat of Hasluck is named Brabham, after Sir Jack Brabham, in recognition of his early racing career at the Caversham motor racing circuit. Personally, I ride a motorbike—not so regularly now, but my love for the sport for over 30 years continues. My dad bought me my first bike when I was still a teenager, and, until recently, I loved getting out on a ride with him, exploring the Perth Hills. At 78, Dad has now decided he will try going pillion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm always happy to find time on the weekend to explore dirt trails in the bush. I've competed in a number of local motorsport events, racing on the track and racing trail and enduro. I also like to help when I can and attend professional events, not just as a spectator but, in the past, in my capacity as the president of Motorcycling Australia and as the Oceania president. I was the first Western Australian on that body and also the first female president. With the board, I worked to modernise the organisation, delivering a national approach to safety and risk and ensuring Australia continued to create champions on the international stage. We certainly have more champions than most countries across speedway, motocross, trials, enduro and MotoGP, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these modern-day fighter pilots are household names. We heard earlier about Mick Doohan; then there's Wayne Gardner, Casey Stoner, Jack 'Thriller' Miller, Toby Price, Neil Price and Jason Doyle. There are so many. While the gender ledger is not yet balanced, it can be, as evidenced by pioneers like Dot Robinson and Peggy Hyde, who were the first to race competitively, in both Australia and the US, over 50 years ago. Thanks to organisations like the Australian Women in Motorcycling Commission, with support from international leadership by the FIM, female participation in Australian motorsports is now at a tipping point, with women and girls showing significant interest and a number of competitors showing the way. Contemporaries like Tayla Jones, Jemma Wilson and Jessica Gardiner competed in the international six-day enduro and have won every one of their events since 2013. They are the most successful unchanged team since the event first started back in 1913.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a big shout-out to Motorsport Australia's Girls on Track program, which enables girls from eight to 18 to participate in events for free, exposing them to many facets of the sport. I also acknowledge Race Chix, who run their own race school and network to support and increase the participation of women in all aspects of sport. This is not just necessarily behind the wheel or in the saddle but as flag marshals, scrutineers, pit crews, safety officers and coaches—all positions which can lead to really exciting international careers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Motorsports, including Formula 1, NASCAR, MotoGP and IndyCar, have provided no end of innovation in their enthusiastic pursuit of the chequered flag. From the very first prize offered way back in 1894 for the first car to make it from Paris to Rouen, that innovation has found its way surely into mainstream car and motorbike manufacturing to the benefit of all consumers. These innovations include, of course, fuel efficiency but also better data-recording devices, full-face helmets, fire retardant materials, better tyre development, the disc brake, anti-lock braking, traction control technology, lightweight parts, aerodynamics, kinetic energy recovery systems and even the rear-view mirror. With innovation comes jobs but also environmental benefits. Formula E, the electric car racing world championships, has provided ongoing innovation to the electric car industry for the last 10 years. As Sylvain Filippi, the manager of Envision Virgin Racing, stated in 2021, 'Electric racing is the hardest test on any battery.' Companies like Filippi's have the motivation and expertise to continue to deliver better performance in both recharging and endurance, which translates into greater take-up of EVs in the community and a greater range of applications for EVs, including in heavy transport. Formula 1 has a commitment to net zero by 2030, and the MotoGP have also announced their plans to get sustainable fuel by 2027.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are formidable challenges and commendable efforts. In order to get there, a great deal of development will need to occur. But, come what may, in 50 years time we will still be participating in this wonderful sport, even if it's electric-vehicle dominated. I hope that, thanks to that technology, I will, like my dad, still be out on my bike then too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Skin cancer is a huge health problem in Australia and in other countries. Unfortunately, Australia leads the world in melanoma diagnoses per capita. There are also a very large number of people diagnosed with other forms of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma—many more than in other countries. In the average year we have about 13,000 diagnoses of melanoma in Australia, and over 950,000 non-melanoma skin cancer diagnoses. That's a huge number, and a huge burden on the health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The causes of skin cancer can be complex, but the two main factors are: No. 1, exposure to ultraviolet light, which we get in Australia because of our climate, and the other is genetics. People with pale skin and blond or red hair are at much higher risk of skin cancer than people with olive or dark skin. Australia, because of its history of colonisation by the Europeans, has the genetics that increase the risk of skin cancer, and also very high ultraviolet light exposure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer; it can spread very quickly, and its growth can be very rapid. Early diagnosis of melanoma and other forms of skin cancer is very important for a cure. We know with melanomas that if they have, at diagnosis, less than one millimetre thickness, then there's a well over 90 per cent chance of survival for 10 years. However, once the lesion is more than four millimetres in thickness, there's only a 50 per cent or less chance of survival for 10 years. So the important thing to know is that early diagnosis is very important, as is prevention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Things have changed in Australia: in my childhood there was a very limited understanding of the causes of skin cancer. We were all exposed to ultraviolet light unwittingly and without the use of sun protection or proper clothing, and for prolonged periods of time. Those in many occupations, such as people who work on the land and people who work outdoors, have a much higher incidence of skin cancer, unfortunately. And whilst melanoma is the most serious form, other forms of skin cancer can be quite disfiguring. Basal cell carcinoma can invade local structures, particularly around the head, neck and face, and can cause quite disfiguring scars when removed. Very rarely it can metastasise—that's quite rare with basal cell carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas, however, can cause multiple lesions and can metastasise. Whilst it doesn't grow as quickly as melanoma, it can be a serious and life-threatening illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diagnosis can be quick, but we have to give people access to treatment. Very briefly: before I came to the chamber this afternoon I rang around several of my local clinics. To see a dermatologist in Campbelltown there's no bulk-billing and the average dermatologist charges almost $300—$290, to be exact—with a rebate from Medicare of $78. So there's an out-of-pocket cost of well over $200. That's very expensive for people at this time of cost-of-living stressors. GP skin cancer clinics charge less, at $220 and with a rebate from Medicare of about $60, but the wait time is almost six months. So it's very hard for people to access skin checks. I think it's very important that we consider a special bulk-billed item number for GP and dermatologist skin checks so that people can access timely, early assessment, because that is the key to diagnosis and that is the key, particularly with melanoma, to long-term survival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get people aware of the importance of things like melanoma. I've seen melanoma in retinas, in ears, on feet and in nail beds. It can occur in places that are hard to see, so it is very important that people are aware of the importance of a full skin check.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I'd be very happy to second the motion. I'd like to thank the member for Macarthur for bringing this to the House. It's a subject very close to my heart. As someone who represents a western New South Wales electorate with great exposure to the sun, I'm well aware of the complications. As a matter of fact, I could be exhibit A. Tomorrow, I won't be here; I'll be in Tamworth having a melanoma and two basal cell carcinomas removed from my face. That's a low-grade melanoma so it should be fine. I've grown those in the last 12 months after I had the last melanoma. The doctor told me that once you've had a melanoma you're 20 times more likely to get another one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been great advances made. With immunotherapy, particularly for the stage 4s and once it's metastasised, they've had great results—however, not with everyone. I understand about 65 per cent of people will respond very positively to immunotherapy. As a matter of fact, I have a cousin who had a melanoma in his bowel, and he's had great results through immunotherapy. Why in his bowel? Some would say that's where he thinks the sun shines from, but that's another matter!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the previous speaker said, they can come under the arches of your feet, under your fingernails and all sorts of places. Indeed, the one I'm having removed tomorrow has been under a hat. As a younger person, all through summer, I would work out in the paddocks with a pair of shorts, a hat and a pair of boots. That was what everyone did in those days. Indeed, I was 50 when I made my first speech in this place, and up until then all my work had been outside under the sun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think we need to do more. I do have some concerns from during the pandemic. A lot of the services to the bush are delivered by FIFO—fly-in fly-out—specialists. Thankfully, we have ones that will come out from the city and run a clinic in Dubbo and places like that. But, with the closures and the clamping down of travel during the pandemic, I am concerned that we are going to see possibly some undiagnosed skin cancer issues, because people haven't been having those regular check-ups. I can see some people in the chamber here who have issues connected to drug companies, and there have been some great advances in treatments in that space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from the member for Macarthur's opening statement, I think we do need to be more aware. I wholeheartedly agree with getting a Medicare item number for this. My procedure tomorrow will cost $1,600 out of pocket to get done. For some people that would be a big imposition on their budget. I would certainly think it would be a tragedy if people chose not to get these things dealt with because they were concerned about the financial implications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a member of the Apex Club of Warialda for 20 years before I came here. The Apex Club of Moree started a campaign about melanoma and skin cancer. That was back in the early eighties. They'd lost a member of their club at a young age through melanoma. So we started putting skin protective creams at local swimming pools and awareness campaigns in local media, because there really was no understanding of the connection between exposure to the sun and the ongoing effects later in life. If you look at my grandkids now, they wear rashies, hats and SP50 before they even go outside, so the message has got through. Hopefully, we might be the last generation that rides this wave of high incidences of melanoma, BCCs and, as the member for Macarthur said, squamous cells, which can be quite dangerous. So slip, slop, slap, but get an annual check-up at least, because it could save your life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion from my parliamentary colleague the member for Macarthur on skin cancer, and on the Albanese Labor government's significant funding of programs and campaigns to ensure that skin cancer is appropriately managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Skin cancer and cancer in general are diseases that unfortunately impact on too many families and individuals. Melanoma was estimated to be the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in males in 2021, behind prostate cancer, and it was the third-most common in females, behind breast cancer and colorectal cancers. Last year, in 2022, more than 17,500 people were expected to have been diagnosed with melanoma. As a survivor of cancer and patron of Relay for Life West Coast, I know all too well the devastation and fear that the diagnosis sparks in individuals, family and friends. It is a frightening moment in time—a moment in which, if we could, we would immediately turn back the clock. For some people who are diagnosed with skin cancer, the spot may not be detected for some time, especially if it's located somewhere on the body that's concealed—whether that be the scalp or the bottom of the foot. A friend of mine had a skin cancer that appeared on the bottom of her foot—as you'd understand, that isn't a spot that we would check regularly, if at all. The spot is understood to have developed while she was sunbathing facedown and feet up, something that we now know to avoid by being sun safe. Unfortunately, there was not really an awareness of that then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early diagnosis is absolutely crucial. Early detection and treating of cancers like skin cancer can have a better outcome and a high success rate. But if detection is not early then there are significant problems. Fortunately, Australia's survival rate following a skin cancer or melanoma diagnosis is one of the highest in the world. The current five-year survival rate for melanoma is 93 per cent, and for non-melanoma skin cancer is nearly 70 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is absolutely committed to improving outcomes for people affected by this disease. We're working alongside experts in the field. A two-year national cancer prevention campaign was announced by health minister, Mark Butler, in 2022. This, appropriately, took place during the Cancer Council's National Skin Cancer Action Week in November. Ten million dollars was invested in the campaign, which is being delivered in partnership with the Cancer Council Australia. This builds on a $10 million skin cancer campaign that the department delivered in partnership with the Cancer Council Australia in the summer of 2021-2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increased awareness is vital to early detection, and this campaign seeks to raise awareness of how to prevent skin cancer. While all Australians will be targeted in the 2022- 2023 campaign, there will be a focus on men aged between 40 and 59 because, typically, they practise less sun-safe behaviours. Data from the Cancer Council's National Sun Protection Survey shows that between 2003 and 2004, and 2016 and 2017, some protection behaviours have improved, but it noted that there are still significant gains to be made, especially for adolescents when compared with adults. This is important, given that all Australian capital cities except for Hobart and Melbourne have at least one month a year when the average UV rating is extreme, which is a health risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond that significant $10 million awareness campaign investment, the Albanese Labor government has also delivered on a budget commitment of $14.8 million in funding over four years to the Melanoma Institute Australia. This important funding is to extend the delivery of the institute's melanoma nurse program across the country from where it currently operates in Perth, Sydney, Wagga Wagga and Hobart. The national melanoma nurses program will support 35 melanoma nurses by 2025-26. The work of a melanoma nurse is incredibly valuable. They help patients find their way through the health system and make informed decisions about their cancer treatment and management. The Albanese Labor government is ensuring that skin cancer and melanoma awareness and treatment are being appropriately funded.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I certainly agree with this motion on skin cancer. I acknowledge the comments made by previous speakers, and I wish the member for Parkes all the very best. Let's hope, in the words of a Robbie Williams song, that he comes back a 'better man'. Let's hope that the biopsy is negative. We need the member for Parkes. We need his common sense in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's common sense to stay out of the sun as much as you can. It's common sense to put sunscreen on, to wear a hat and to do all of those things. But, as the member for Parkes and the member for Macarthur have already stated, back in the day, the harmful effects of the sun weren't all that well known. I was fortunate that I had a mother—my late mother, Eileen—who always made sure that I had a hat on when I went outside and, certainly, when I was playing cricket, not that I used to bat that long! But that was more of an issue of my ability, rather than, perhaps, the fact that I needed to wear a hat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wagga Wagga is a very sporting community. I well recall somebody who was a good cricketer, Peter St Clair. He and his wife, Annette, had a beautiful daughter Amie, and she is no longer with us. One day after her 23rd birthday, she lost her battle with melanoma. She had discovered a lump in her groin when she was only 20 years old, and she was very prompt in seeking medical advice. She did all the right things: she had an ultrasound and a biopsy. But she was diagnosed with melanoma, and there was no primary skin lesion ever found—ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her parents will be here this Wednesday, to attend the launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Melanoma and Skin Cancer Awareness. I commend the member for Blaxland and the member for Gippsland for co-chairing that important group. I hope as many members as possible can join that particular group and turn up to the launch function. I know the member for Blaxland, the Minister for Education. He's a good man, a very good man. I think all members of parliament would agree that he is a very valuable member of this parliament and his contribution is mighty. In September 2019, he had a scare with melanoma, and I'm not talking out of turn; I'm not talking out of school. He did. He made it well known that he had a situation with his leg, which required an operation that was quite severe, and he said himself that it made him reflect on life and on how lucky he was, because it, too, proved benign. But it could have been the other way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the comments made by previous speakers about the incidence of melanoma in men. Men aren't always as quick or as willing to seek medical treatment as, perhaps, women are, and that is a fault of ours. It's always: 'She'll be right, mate'. But it's not right. When it comes to these sorts of things, get checked out. Take the opportunity this week, as parliamentarians—others, too, should take the opportunity—to be checked out. I concur with the comments of the member for Parkes about the cost. I concur with the comments of the member for Macarthur about making it a Medicare provider number. That would be an important initiative, and I will do anything I can to support him in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Amie St Clair, her parents now have a wonderful trust to raise money and awareness for skin safety. Just this weekend, in fact, they had a Colour Run, raising very valuable awareness and, moreover, funds for that, at Apex Park. Whilst a lot of fun was had and a lot of people attended—and a lot of people got smothered with paint—it is a great education program that they provide, and, certainly, the legacy of Amie St Clair lives on. Whilst she is no longer with us—and more is the pity—indeed her legacy lives on through her parents and through the advocacy of all her friends and family, who support the cause, who support the trust, who continue to advocate. If is saves just one life, if it makes one person go and have a check, go to the medical appointment, then the whole cause will be worthwhile. So, I commend the motion. I thank both the member for Blaxland and the member for Gippsland for having the foresight to have that 'friends of' group. And I wish the member for Parkes, my great friend and colleague, all the very best for tomorrow in Tamworth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  Firstly, I commend the member for Macarthur for bringing this matter of skin cancer before the house for debate. As someone with lifelong medical experience, I believe that this House should take note of his comments in respect to this matter and his general wisdom when it comes to medical procedures more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every illness or disease is extremely debilitating and disruptive, and I'm sure the member for Parkes, who talked about his own situation, would attest to that. It's emotionally and financially draining. For people who suffer from a serious illness, I suspect that very little else matters to them until the illness is under control. Their focus would be solely on that, so that they can get back to normal life. The reality is that so many illnesses are indeed preventable, including melanoma and other skin cancers. We've seen over the years that we can get good results with campaigns, such as with smoking, bowel cancer, asbestos awareness and even the 'slip-slop-slap' campaign, which I have no doubt has made a difference and saved lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Melanoma is a serious cancer and, again, I think we could do a lot more. It costs lives, and apart from the fact that it costs some $400 million each year, the reality is, as the member for Pearce quite rightly pointed out, that each year some 17,500 people are diagnosed with the illness. Of those, 1,225 or thereabouts will not get past the first five years. If you put that into a more understandable series of statistics, every day around 48 people are diagnosed with melanoma and, of those, somewhere between three and four will not survive it. When you look at it like that, you realise that this is a medical issue that affects a lot of lives. Just as importantly, it's a medical issue that I believe we as a society can do more about. Again, the member for Pearce has quite rightly pointed to the $14.8 million over four years to the melanoma Institute of Australia that was announced by this government and that would deliver some 35 nurses across the country, and also the $10 million of funding over two years for skin cancer awareness campaigns. That builds on a previous $10 million. Again, I welcome those commitments and I commend the minister for them, and I believe that they will make a huge difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to go to the substance of this motion, and I will just read three parts of it, because I think they go to the heart of what we're debating here today. The member for Macarthur moves that 'Australians require more equitable access to skin cancer checks with the need for greater access through general practitioner clinics and dermatologists'. That's (1)(b). Then (1)(e) goes on to say 'diagnosis is being inhibited by the costs involved in GP and dermatologist skin cancer checks', and part (2) of the motion 'calls for the consideration of a separate bulk-billed GP and specialist item number for skin cancer checks'. Those three points of the motion I think go to the heart of what we're debating, because they highlight the fact that we need more skin checks and that that's the way to prevent more people not only from getting melanoma but from perhaps dying from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly: the cost, and the member for Macarthur, again, referred to the cost when he quoted the statistics from his own research only today. I know from speaking to people literally every day that medical costs do stop people from going to see doctors to have regular check-ups that they should be having, not just for this illness but for many others, which could save their lives. But they won't do it because they simply cannot afford it in many cases, and other priorities take over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to try to overcome that. Therefore, the member for Macarthur provides a suggestion that we consider a separate bulk-billed GP and specialist item No. 4 for skin cancer checks. My view is that, if we can do that, the cost that we bear upfront will be more than offset by the savings further down the track. Regrettably, and I have made this point in respect to a number of other health matters, governments—of all persuasions—always look at the upfront cost without factoring in the economic savings right along the line and at the end. It's time that we started to do that, because, if we did, my view is that the process and procedure that the member for Macarthur is suggesting is actually affordable and fundable. It's fundable by looking at those savings, and I commend this motion to the House. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  Like all other speakers, I rise to speak in favour of the motion and start by commending the member for Macarthur for bringing it before us, and I also thank the other speakers who have all shared very important contributions, which have often involved personal stories. One of the great things we can do in this chamber is share experiences and perhaps come to understand just how far-reaching some of the issues and challenges that we face are in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly commend the member for Macarthur—being from the government—for moving a motion that is indeed asking for a significant reform of the government that he is a part of. I don't make that as a political point at all. I think that is to be commended, and it reminds us that we humble legislators can indeed make sensible suggestions to the members of the executive, and I hope that this debate is an opportunity to pursue, with some unanimity, reform in this area. So thank you very much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think it's worth, on the positive side, noting how far we have come in awareness around the risk of skin cancer and the sorts of behavioural changes that need to be made. There are some horror stories I've heard from my parents about their childhoods. Far from being sun smart, there were practices in the fifties and sixties that were almost asking for trouble. I think my father's sister used to apply oil on her body and lie in the sun with mirrors pointed at her and a transistor radio on. I know that was because of ignorance and not deciding that a short-term tan was worth the potential risk of death later in life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in the eighties at the beginning of the slip, slop, slap campaigns, and I think there are a few other words that the younger ones are aware of now—I think there's a wrap and a something else—that has led to a much transformed awareness of the risk of skin cancer, and that's a great thing. As the member for Parkes pointed out through his own vocation, we live in this country where there is a very significant risks for so many people in the way they live their lives and earn their livelihoods, particularly in this multicultural society. We're very proud of the multicultural society we are in, but I've got Western European heritage, and we're not that good at standing up to the harsh Australian sun. The fact that that awareness is there now and everyone knows what the risks are is really important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I want to dwell on was already made by the member for Riverina, and I make that point as part of my age cohort. I'm still just in my 30s. As an almost 40-year-old man, one of the biggest problems we've got is the 'she'll be right, mate' attitude that the average Aussie bloke like me tends to have when it comes to our own health—across all topics, not just skin. It's probably most concerning around mental health, and it's been great to see the de-stigmatisation of having conversations about those sorts of things in recent years. A very dear friend of mine was diagnosed at a ridiculously young age—in his 20s—with bowel cancer. Regrettably, he didn't take his early symptoms seriously enough. He went on a holiday and decided he would see his doctor about it a few months later when he got back and, regrettably, it was all too late for him. Within 10 years he had died of the cancer that had started as bowel cancer and spread to other parts of his body. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to do all we can, particularly with cohorts like the one I am in, to remind people how seriously to take our health and—to the member for Makin's point—how much of a difference it can make to embrace early intervention and understand that, apart from the important health outcome, whatever the cost might be to government it's actually not the cost that it looks like on paper. The cost of treatment if diagnosis hasn't happened early enough is always going to be much higher than the cost of doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really welcome the opportunity to contribute to this and make the point that all of us—and it's really a great example, and the Member for Macarthur has brought something into the space—have been able to share personal stories and talk about how we can do better as leaders in our community. That awareness is one thing I would like to take the opportunity to do more of as an elected representative, and this motion has provided that opportunity, so I thank you very much. I commend the motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  If we are really seeking to achieve our goals in regard to climate targets then I urge the Australian government to speed up the electrification of residential homes and businesses. We will be seeing the smart home of the future looking very different to the homes we have today. One of the big differences will be that gas could slowly disappear from the energy footprint. The general prediction for leading architects in renewable energy experts is that in the next decade smart homes and fully electrified homes will come into their own. They can offer us lower running costs and more comfort if we build homes that overall respect the climate we have in Australia. Why do we have a sea of black roofs in Western Sydney which heat up the homes and drive up the air-conditioning bills? It makes me shake my head. Why do we have shading pergolas and verandahs in older-style homes, and many modern homes with big windows facing west and acting like heat absorbers in summer?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan to electrify homes will rely on government programs to enable this direction. It must come with a review of the many wasteful energy practices we currently have in our planning and designing our homes. We have to have architects, builders, consumer groups and the government set a framework of fully electrified homes of the future and how they can look, with an overall lower energy footprint allowing for the maximum use of solar and batteries in people's homes. Gas hot-water tanks will become electric heat pumps. Heating and cooling will utilise electricity, but this electricity only helps in our climate goals if we use renewable energy in the generation of this electricity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ways to achieve a better energy outcome could be something along the lines of the European energy pass for homes, which I have seen in practice in Germany. As we all know, energy efficiency is a crucial aspect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. The German energy pass is a document that provides information on the energy efficiency of buildings and can help homeowners and buyers make informed decisions about energy usage. The energy pass was introduced in Germany in 2008 and is now mandatory for all buildings that are put on the market for sale or rent. The energy pass provides information on the building's insulation, heating systems and other energy-related features, and gives the building a rating from A to G, where A represents the most energy-efficient buildings and G the least efficient. One of the main benefits of the energy pass is that it helps people make informed decisions about the energy efficiency of a building. For example, a buyer or renter can use the energy pass to compare the energy efficiency of different properties and make a decision based on the energy consumption and cost they are willing to incur. In addition, an energy pass can also be used to identify areas where a building can be made more energy efficient, helping to reduce energy consumption and costs and to make the building more environmentally friendly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, a future energy pass could be an important tool that provides information on the energy efficiency of buildings. By promoting energy-efficient buildings the energy pass helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy consumption and costs, and make our buildings more environmentally friendly. Let's find a way to cut fossil fuels out of our consumption chain, but let's transition it smartly and cost effectively.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  Before I speak on this motion, I just want to say that I caught the end of the member for Sturt's contribution on the member for Macarthur's excellent motion on skin cancer and I could not agree with him more. Men have to listen better to what their bodies are telling them. We all have to do better. But prevention is better than cure, and I would like to join with him in what he said about encouraging people to make sure they get the medical check-ups they need and look after themselves when they can. So thank you for that contribution. And thank you, Member for North Sydney, for this motion. I think it's an important conversation to have about how we can do all that we can to reduce emissions and be more energy efficient. Sometimes we focus on the big and really important debates and forget to talk about the other things that we can do, which aren't small but perhaps are more easily digested and should be thought about more than the big issue of how we transition out of fossil fuels into renewable energy. This is part of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I talk about the government's plan for better energy performance and add some extra thoughts of my own, I wanted to talk about one of the ways we are trying to do this in my local community and have had support from the Albanese government. Carrum Downs, in my electorate, is a great part of south-east Melbourne, but it has to be said that it's not one of the wealthiest parts. It's full of hardworking Australians who struggle with any change in their weekly, let alone daily, cost of living. I think that's partly why households across Carrum Downs have embraced renewable energy, with solar uptake at a higher rate than the Victorian average. More than one in five households across the entire city of Frankston, which is most of my electorate, have solar, but there is no doubt that, for most households, the high price of batteries means that families are still struggling to release the full potential of rooftop solar, putting more pressure on our electricity grid. With the current issues with arising power prices, it is more important than ever that we help households and families to play their part—which I know is what the member for North Sydney's motion was also partly about—doing what they can not just to reduce their emissions but also to reduce their power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was thrilled when an election commitment was made to have a community battery in Carrum Downs and I was, it must be said, even more thrilled when the Minister for Climate Change and Energy announced that Carrum Downs would have one of the first 58 batteries. The tender is now open for applications to deliver that project, and I have before and do again urge people in my community, businesses, individuals and organisations to look at that tender process and to apply. It is something that is going to make a big difference to the people of Carrum Downs, and I'm very hopeful that, when this rolls out more broadly because the benefits are seen, it will also benefit other people across my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I'm sure other government members have said when they have spoken on this motion, we are looking to develop a robust energy performance strategy. There is no doubt that, if we work together with businesses and communities but also all levels of government, local, state, and federal, we can build better homes, we can upgrade existing homes, we can bring better transparency to home energy performance, we can use more efficient appliances in our homes and our businesses and better equipment in our industries and we can find smart ways to manage demand to use less electricity and to use it when its cheapest and cleanest. We do want to empower people to do that, and the assistant minister, Senator McAllister, has announced that she will deliver a national energy performance strategy to bring coordination and leadership to demand-side reform. We have many of the solutions that we need now; we just need the goodwill of all levels of government to work together to deliver them and to make sure that we utilise the technology that will undoubtedly be developed every moment of every day into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  Goodwill amongst governments is one thing, but what we also need to make sure of in this motion, put forward by the member for North Sydney, is that housing can still be affordable. I very much appreciate that a better insulated house is going to reduce energy prices. That's understandable. I have no qualms, no questions there. But what we can't do is push the prices up because of ideology so that it makes new homes, or any homes, renovations or refurbishments for that matter, unaffordable to the average buyer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stricter energy standards for new homes and those new laws and regulations put in place in New South Wales are seeing the cost of building a house in Wagga Wagga, in my home town, surge by up to $30,000. Yes, it may also lead to cheaper energy bills for residents. But when we've got higher prices for groceries, higher prices for energy costs, high costs for everything—for the cost of living—why would we want to go and, just for the sake of ideology, push the price of the average house or the new homebuyer house up by $30,000?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales government announced—this is going back to September last year—that all new homes and renovations that cost more than $50,000 will need to meet a seven-star energy rating from October this year. The minimum rating at the time that was announced was just 5.5 stars. Builders were told that part of this legislation meant they would need to start implementing better insulation, more double-glazed windows and smarter layouts to reach the new requirement. Some might argue, 'Well, that's all well and good,' but this is an industry that is fighting the good fight against higher prices for timber. Where do they source timber? Nobody in this country these days seems to want to cut down a tree. The price for just the metal brackets—if you can get those metal brackets, imported or otherwise—to go on frames has gone through the roof. The price has soared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I regularly get texts from Wagga Wagga builder Wayne Carter. He described the change brought about by the state government as 'another blow for the construction industry', which is also facing, like every other industry, the question of where do they find labour? If they can find labour, how much do they have to pay those workers to keep them, to retain them in the sector? He said: 'It's been on the table for a while, and we've all been shuddering for it to be adopted. It means it's going to cost so much more to build a house, and that's a cost which the local people who want to own homes can ill afford.' I agree with Mr Carter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from very, very personal experience—my wife, Catherine, worked in the industry for 17 years as a regional manager. Her company, Dennis Family Homes, a Melbourne based company, has shut up some of its regional operations because of the downturn in the industry. It's tough. And I know, despite the measures put in place by the member for Deakin when he was the Minister for Housing to make sure the industry was its best self during COVID, it was hard to find labour. It was hard for the industry—whether they were local small-time operators or whether they were a big housing company like Dennis or others—to make ends meet. But not only that, Labor comes to government and promises one million affordable social houses. I say good luck with that. I'll be watching with keen interest to see if that actually comes off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Glenn Maslin, another local house builder in Wagga Wagga, says: 'The price of housing has increased by 15 per cent because of COVID, and now you're looking at another five per cent on top of that. The industry's going to suffer from all of these additional changes that seem to keep coming in.' So it's difficult. In this space, we need to think about those people. It's about balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the member for North Sydney and her good intent with this private member's bill, but we need to make sure that we can keep housing affordable for the person who wants to get into their new house or buy for their family.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  Australia is no stranger to extreme weather: heatwaves, droughts, floods and bushfires. Our community on the New South Wales South Coast has seen our fair share of it over the last few years. We know what it means to have reliable and efficient energy, or, should I say, we know what it means when that reliability fails because of climate change. In the wake of so many disasters, many local people are looking for new ways to climate-proof their homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we move into the next phase of our recovery, we are seeing a new set of questions being asked. The South Coast community saw direct and indirect impacts from this string of disasters, so the question is broader than just asking where or what we build; it's about how we build. It's not just about protection from fire or protection from flood; it's also about resilience from power failures, protection against heat and smoke and protection against mould, mildew and water inundation. We have just witnessed a decade of neglect from the previous government, with the failure to make a real energy plan, the failure to take action on climate change and the failure to address our escalating housing crisis. So these questions should come as no surprise. Well, the Albanese government is not going to make the same mistakes they did. We have already enshrined our emissions target in law, taking real action to address our changing climate. We have already started the path for our Powering Australia plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, I was delighted to promise a community battery for the Maloneys Beach community, which will help people in this village reduce their energy cost and reduce their reliance on external power supplies, making them more resilient and better prepared for the future. In the wake of the bushfires, the Maloneys Beach Residents Association identified power and communications resilience as a key theme that local people wanted addressed. They did some research and found that, if they had a whole-of-community buy-in, it would be cheaper and more efficient to have a battery and backup power generators. We agreed, and now we have the Community Batteries for Household Solar program that can help communities, like Maloneys Beach, do just that. I'm really excited to see that come to fruition, but it is only the beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More-efficient homes improve our energy consumption, reduce emissions, improve resilience and improve health. It is win-win, not just for communities but also for government, saving us all money in the long run. It is smart policy for individuals and for the country. With a government that will actually lead the way, we can have a sensible and constructive conversation about improving our energy performance to help us reduce emissions. Instead of hyperbole and hysteria about types of power, we can make Australia an energy powerhouse. This is a real and genuine way to reduce energy costs and drive our transition to emissions-efficient power—smarter, cheaper and cleaner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will waste no time. In fact, we have already begun. In October we announced that the Albanese government will deliver the National Energy Performance Strategy, our long-term plan to bring affordability, reliability and sustainability to our energy system. We want to empower people to improve the energy performance of their homes because we know the wide-ranging benefits that will have, not just in times of disaster but all year round. As part of our $15.2 million investment over four years to provide a framework for demand-side action, we released a consultation paper in November so that we can work with all stakeholders to develop a comprehensive energy performance plan, one that will take the pressure off prices, take the pressure off our climate, support efficient energy use and look at the suitability of our targets to drive better energy performance across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australia has lacked over the last decade of the Liberal government is a sensible government holding sensible and constructive conversations with the experts about how we can tackle the challenges our energy sector is facing. We won't achieve anything with hysteria about so-called health impacts of windfarms. The science on that is settled. We won't achieve anything with distracting conversations about nuclear power. The science is settled on that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we must do and must do now is address our changing climate and do what we can. We must prepare our communities for the very real impacts of climate change, which are already happening. We simply have to support locals with cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy and better energy performance. The Albanese government is committed to doing this without the hysteria, to just having sensible conversations with the experts and our communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted to support this motion moved by the member for Robertson, my dear friend Dr Gordon Reid, who is a great asset to this parliament. I'm also proud to be a member of the Albanese government, which introduced and passed the National Health Amendment (General Co-payment) Bill 2022. This legislation successfully resulted in cheaper medicines for almost 19 million Australians by ensuring that they pay almost 30 per cent less for their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme scripts. This is a win for all Australians—old, young, families and individuals. It is now easier to access affordable medicines. Because of the increase in the cost-of-living stresses on families, and as a paediatrician, I fully supported this legislation, and I'm very grateful that we've been able to do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a doctor, I understand how stressful the cost of medication can be for patients and their families. It can sometimes be the difference between food in the fridge and prescription forms being completed. Not infrequently I've had patients ask me, when given a list of medications they need for their child: 'What are the most important ones? Which ones should I get straightaway?' This is true for young families who may have several kids with asthma; kids with severe eczema, who require multiple treatments; children with multiple allergies; and children with a number of different disorders, including epilepsy. It was often a question for those families of whether they should get all the prescriptions filled when they were needed or whether they could delay at least some of them so they could afford the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation really is an achievement worth noting. No other government has delivered cheaper medicines at this rate. It's the first time that the cost of general scripts has fallen in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which, you would all be aware, was a great victory for the Chifley Labor government. In my electorate of Macarthur, this legislation is already having a significant effect and positive impact, with over 100,000 people already benefiting from this, ensuring more households can access medication that's needed with less financial pressure than before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, also mentioned in her speech during the second reading debate on the legislation how Australians living with diabetes, which is millions of people, are some of the biggest winners from this legislation. Children are also some of the biggest winners from this legislation, I would say, because they can now get all the treatments that they require. For example, an individual who has 13 scripts per year for diabetes medication will save over $160, as the cost of the script for nonpensioners has fallen from $42.50 to $30. Other winners are those who require a tablet for the prevention of stroke—an anticoagulant or blood-thinning medication. Under this legislation, those who require 26 scripts per year are saving $325 every year, which is a huge financial win for Australian patients and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this legislation is also an important step in ensuring that healthcare access in Australia remains as equitable as possible. I think that at the moment, after 10 years of a coalition government, there are questions about the equity of access to health care in Australia. Health access is becoming increasingly difficult for some of the poorest Australians, and that's something that we must fight against. Health access is important for everyone, not just wealthy people, and the Albanese government is doing its best to reverse the trends of the last 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medication is important for people across the age spectrum, from the very young to the very old. We have often heard how pharmacists are asked which the cheaper brand option is and whether certain medications are necessary or not. Labor has a strong commitment and a proud record in health care, and we're doing our best as part of our ideology, which is to deal with inequities in access to health care. I really look forward to the changes that the Albanese government will make to make health access much more equitable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I was very pleased to speak in support of legislation that brought in a dramatic reduction in the co-payment. This, of course, was an announcement that the coalition made in the election campaign, and it was matched by the then Labor opposition. Last year in the parliament we had the opportunity to debate and pass that legislation, and it was an excellent outcome from a cost-of-living point of view—of course, making medicines cheaper for people. Listing these medicines on the PBS is something I was very proud of, that I was a part of the government that announced that in the campaign. We have bipartisanship around that principle by virtue of both sides agreeing to put it in place, and it was just a few months ago that we passed it through the parliament. It was a great outcome for the many millions of people who benefit from that reduction in the cost of the co-payment through the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the TGA for the work that they do. They've had a lot of work to do over the last couple of years in dealing with members of the public and their views on them et cetera. I think we're lucky to have the system which we have, which starts with the TGA and moves through to PBS listing. I also really commend former Minister Greg Hunt for the enormous number of medicines that were listed on the PBS during his tenure. I remember all the times we would hear in the parliament about the new medicines that were listed on the PBS and how life changing they were for people who needed access to those treatments. Of course, a medicine being on the PBS can make an enormous difference: in some cases: it can go from someone having costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to costs in the hundreds of dollars per year for treatment that they absolutely deserve to have supported through the PBS system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During COVID, while we were in government, we deployed the rollout of telehealth, which is important to couple with the issue of prescriptions. During that time, of course, it was very difficult to access a physical consultation with a GP. This was one of the great reforms, and it would have taken years--probably decades—were it not for the challenge of COVID and therefore a greater openness for faster reform. We delivered that telehealth rollout, and I think it's worth remembering that in the universal telehealth rollout we were able to deliver 100 million telehealth consultations to 17 million people. And, of course, those were bulk billed. It was quite transformative. When it comes to access for medicines and prescriptions, that's one of the things: telehealth is such an obvious opportunity for repeat prescriptions in particular, to have a very straightforward and smooth consultation via telehealth rather than having a physical appointment. Both the risk of that during COVID and also the reality that telehealth is much more efficient and quicker meant that we didn't have the situation that we do here at times, where people, because of access issues, have haven't had prescription medicine renewed and perhaps have a period of time where they go off that medication that they should be on. That's when the great outcomes of telehealth, coupled with PBS reforms that we announced, are an excellent cost-of-living outcome for people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk that we have now is, even though we have a bipartisan dramatic reduction in the co-payment, what is going to happen in the years ahead as potential indexation increases within this scheme and other healthcare costs come into play when inflation is running so hot, at nearly eight per cent. That is what I do worry about. Having dramatically reduced the co-payment, is that going to be slowly eaten away by indexation increases that will come and hit all of those that access the PBS equally as hard as the high inflation environment that we're in right now comes into play? This is why it is disingenuous in this motion to crow about some spectacular cost-of-living outcome from this. The way things are structured and the way things will happen going forward, unless there are any changes, there will be some major indexation increases coming in the future, and it's up to the government to decide whether they will absorb that rather than pass it along to consumers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for giving us all this great opportunity to get up and speak about this policy, its life-saving abilities and its ability to reduce the pressures on costs of living. We know that Australian patients will, for the first time since the creation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, get a much-needed cut to the cost of medicines, leaving more money and people's pockets to provide for their families. At a time when costs of living are going up, putting pressure on families across the country, this is one measure showing that the government is working hard to ensure that the relief it provides is targeted, measured and such that it does not add to the inflationary time bomb we inherited from the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, more than 900,000 patients delayed or didn't get a script filled in 2019-2020 due to the cost of their medications. No-one should have to choose between filling prescriptions for life-saving medicines and affording their day-to-day necessities. Our determination to deliver cheaper medicines will help everyday Australians. Under the cheaper medicines policy, the co-payment has reduced from $42.50 to just $30. That's a whopping 29 per cent reduction. This means that for PBS medications you'll only pay up to $30 and the government covers the rest. This is having real-world benefits. This is helping everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penelope, in my electorate of Bennelong, contacted me at the end of last year. She has been a carer for her mum for the past seven years. She had a broken ankle and was struggling to walk and make ends meet. She wanted to know how she could get access to cheaper medications to make some savings where she could. Because of the commitment of this government, from 1 January she has been saving on her medications. She now has more money in her budget to help provide for her family. Since 1 January, when this legislation came into effect, people like Penelope have been able to better afford medicines that they need to keep themselves and their family healthy. Someone taking one medicine a month is now saving $150 every year. A family with two or three medications is now saving between $300 and $450 a year. That's money back in their pocket and back in the household budget. That's real cost-of-living relief targeting those who really need it. In Bennelong, cheaper medicine will mean over 87,000 patients putting money back into their pockets, money back for their families. They are now saving a collective amount of over $4.7 million a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a local, I've visited a number of pharmacies in my electorate since this policy was announced and since its implementation. I've been to the Amcal chemist in the Macquarie Centre and to see Kevin, Johnny and Vivienne at the North Ryde Pharmacy in Cox's Road Mall, as well as my little pharmacy round the corner at Blenheim Road. These pharmacies and their staff are trusted, they care for their patients and they have an intimate understanding of their patients' needs. They all have the same story: they told me of the scores of people that would go up to the counter with multiple scripts, asking the pharmacist: 'Which medicine can I afford to miss out on this week?' These stories are of people risking their health and going without the medicines they need because they cannot afford their medications. They're not just stories; they're real people who are now, because of this government, paying less for their medicine. There are 87,000 patients in Bennelong will benefit from this, forming just one part of the 3.6 million Australians who have been saving on their medical scripts since 1 January under this government. We know our communities and we know that vulnerable Australians deserve to be supported. That's why we've taken every opportunity, particularly at this time, to ease the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I close, I pay particular tribute to the members of this parliament who have a wealth of experience being doctors, GPs and pharmacists: the member MacArthur, Higgins, Kooyong, Mackellar, Dobell, and Robertson. I'm sure they catch up regularly and exchange notes as part of the medical caucus, but what a time for such an experienced bunch of citizens to be in this parliament, when we know we need to improve access to medicines and to our medical system. I thank them for all they bring to this place. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  I thank the member for Bennelong for his kind words. I rise to speak today in response to this motion regarding the recent reduction to the cost of medications on the PBS. Healthy nations are prosperous nations. Australia's universal health system, Medicare, our world-class hospitals and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are perhaps our greatest national assets. For this reason, I welcome the government's decision to reduce patient contributions to medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. A 30 per cent reduction in costs represents very real savings for Australian households. We know that the out-of-pocket cost to patients of GP visits and medicines are an increasing burden to many of us in this time of significant cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accessible medicines are a pillar of our national health system. Medications have to be not just affordable but also accessible. Australia imports more than 90 per cent of its medications. In fact, we're dangerously dependent on imported medicines. Recent supply chain issues have impacted many of my constituents, putting them at risk of harm from side effects related to alternative preparations and also the long-term health obligations of uncontrolled disease. Mr Ian Picken of Balwyn told me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When seeking to purchase a monthly update of my prescription which I have been taking for several years, my pharmacist advised there is currently no stock. It is now several weeks that I have been waiting for supplies to be available. My pharmacist has me on a priority list and has undertaken to call me once he has some stock. Hopefully next week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another Kooyong constituent, Daniel, is worried about being forced to change his medications. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have found out from my doctor that the company has stopped making my drug and no other company makes it as it is no longer profitable. That is the bottom line. So I have to come off them gradually and then nothing for at least a week before I can try a new drug.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He added—and he's right—you can't change your medication like you change your socks. Mr Alex Mazzolini of Hawthorn advised me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On several occasions when I have been unable to get my diabetes medication I have gone on to half dose to make the supply I have last a little longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past few months alone we have seen shortages of multiple antibiotics in Australia, including paediatric preparations, diabetes medications and antidepressants. How many Australians are having their health compromised by a lack of access to the medications that they need? Other constituents have expressed frustration in relation to the prescribing and dispensing of medications in this country. They describe unnecessary, costly visits to their GP for repeat prescriptions, and the limits placed on supply at the pharmacy which mean both inconvenience and, often, additional cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for routine repeat scripts is an inconvenience; it's an avoidable cost to Medicare, an unnecessary demand on the GP sector and, more and more, it's an increased out-of-pocket cost to patients. The supply of prescription medications by pharmacies is regulated; multiple prescriptions are supplied only in certain circumstances. In 2018, the PBAC recommended allowing the dispensing of 143 commonly dispensed medications at two months worth at a time. Why are we still paying too much in dispensing fees? Our health system needs reform in order to adapt to changing demographics and evolving health pressures. We need system revision, with flexibility and agility. We need to avoid unnecessary repetition of both medical and pharmaceutical services, and we need to give patients greater agency over the management of their own health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a national strategy to ensure reliable supply of medications, including a review of our sovereign manufacturing capacity and how our government can support better support it. While our domestic market is small, we do have established supply chains and we have great proximity to the Pacific market. We could expand our manufacturing capacity, decrease our sovereign risk and support our Pacific partners by increasing local manufacture of pharmaceuticals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my constituents for allowing me to share their personal experiences, which are the experiences of many Australians. There is still much work to do for us to make medicines more equitably affordable and reliably accessible for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  As someone who grew up in a household where my parents ran their own medical practice, the importance of universal public health is really something that has been instilled in me from a very young age. I'm really excited to stand here today and speak about legislation that will see, for the first time since the creation of the PBS, patients paying less for medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis inherited from the previous government. Anything we can do to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on families is really important to my community and, indeed, to communities across Australia. Health is really important to my community, as I'm sure it is to the communities of all of my colleagues here today. In my electorate of Chisholm there's some really the exciting news around health. The Victorian Heart Hospital, which was funded by the Victorian Labor government and Monash University will open its doors shortly. It is the first and only cardiac hospital in Australia. And we recently turned the sod for Moderna in my electorate of Chisholm too; they will join Pfizer as just two of the pharmaceutical and medical technology companies to set up business in my local area. So the importance of health, medicine and an accessible, equitable and well-funded health system really matter to my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly, we will also see the National Reconstruction Fund debated in this place. This is a really important policy that we took to the last election, and it was very well received my community. We have all experienced the global shortage of medicine due to disrupted supply chains and also due to the failure of investment in sovereign capability and domestic manufacturing capacity. These are the high-wage, high-skill jobs of the future. On our watch, we will see this kind of advanced manufacturing revived once again, providing the good and secure jobs that our communities rely on and, more than that, making the kinds of things, like medicines, that our communities need. I think everyone was really shocked at the extent to which we were unable to make things here in Australia, so I'm really pleased that's going to change under our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor governments, including the Albanese Labor government, have always invested in and defended public health in this country. Of course we were the first people to bring in universal health care in Australia, and had to reintroduce it after it was, unfortunately, abolished by the coalition. What we're doing with the co-payment bill—which I'm excited to speak about, because it's already making a difference to hip pockets—is saving people money. Not only are we saving people money; we're removing the horrible choice that people have to make between whether they go to the pharmacy and pay for life-saving medications or they pay for their groceries or their rent or their petrol. This is a choice nobody in a country like Australia should ever be forced to make. We should be protecting our universal healthcare system and making sure it is equitable for everybody. Now, instead of paying what they used to for medications if they had one script that needed to be filled, people will be saving $150 a year. Those filling two scripts a month could save around $300 a year. There are 3.6 million Australians with current prescriptions over $30 who are already saving money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is devastating that people have been forced into situations where they are making choices around their health because they might not be able to afford to get access to medicine. Of course, we've also seen people not being able to afford to go and see a general practitioner to get a prescription in the first instance. In fact, over the last decade in my electorate alone—and I suspect the numbers are similar in other places around the country—the out-of-pocket costs that people experience going to a GP increased by a shocking 38 per cent. In that instance too we are seeing people making very difficult and very dangerous decisions about not seeing medical practitioners, because they simply can't afford it. That's not good enough; we're doing better. I'm really pleased that people are starting to save money. We are committed to Medicare. We are committed to equitable, genuine universal health, and I'm really pleased that the member for Robertson has put this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I was intrigued by the previous member's contribution, having regard to the fact that everybody's agreed on universal health care. Everybody wants the best for their community. And there's a very clear statement by the member that these families are under enormous pressure from cost-of-living expenses, exacerbated by the problems within health care in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right around the country we're seeing ambulances ramping at every hospital, and it's getting worse and worse. It's not getting better. This is exacerbated by cuts to the telehealth and mental health rebates and by exhausted and overwhelmed GPs, doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Our health and hospital systems are in freefall. In fact, there was one lady who was going for an allied healthcare appointment in Gippsland. She was in such pain she thought she'd call in to the hospital, on her way to the appointment, for some pain relief. They said, 'It's no good sitting here; we can't see you for two and a half hours,' and she was in such pain that she called into the hospital for help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never known a time like this in my time as a representative or as a member of the community. No-one seems to care enough about what's happening in the system to ask questions. No-one's asking why—what's causing our nation's first-class health system to crumble in so many areas? There's a lot of blame being attributed to workforce shortages and staff being sick with COVID and other flu viruses, so why isn't the health minister putting pressure on state counterparts to drop the insidious and redundant COVID-19 mandates and reinstate our heroic frontline workers who remain unable to work due to the mandates because they are not vaccinated?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these workers is Lexie Tuckett—she doesn't mind me using her name. She's 22 years of age, and her story is heartbreaking. Lexie told me that it was always her dream to help others, and she was rightly very proud when she graduated, in December 2021, with a Bachelor of Paramedicine. Four weeks later, she started her induction with the New South Wales Ambulance service. Part of the pre-employment check related to vaccines, but she was not at all concerned. She was up to date with all vaccines and had a medical exemption for the COVID-19 vaccination approved by Medicare, with a signed letter from her doctor. On the second day of her induction, Lexie received an email from New South Wales Ambulance to advise that her exemption had not met the ATAGI guidelines and that her COVID-19 vaccination exemption could not be approved. To continue with New South Wales Ambulance, she'd have to have her first dose of COVID-19 vaccination in three days time and have the second dose three weeks after that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Lexie's parents sought urgent legal advice on her behalf, Lexie was stood down, effective immediately, and advised she would be placed on leave without pay until vaccinated. Lexie was able to give her service to the high-country Ski Patrol. Why is it that she could give her service to save a life—which she did, in the high country—working with the Ski Patrol but couldn't work as a paramedic in New South Wales? How could that be, and how many hundreds and hundreds of professional health workers are out there cleaning toilets and washing dishes, instead of doing what they should be doing: helping the people that they love?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  Australians are doing it tough. After nine years of neglect from the former government, the cost of living is soaring, and many Australians are cutting back on essentials in order to make ends meet. As the member for Newcastle, I know that Novocastrians are feeling the pinch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An ABC article this morning highlighted the story of a Newcastle local, Teresa Hetherington. I know Teresa well. She's a hard worker and immensely dedicated to the clients she sees in her job as a home carer. But Teresa says that the days at the end of her pay cycle are 'hair-raising'. She is reliant on her car to travel from client to client, and fuelling up has become so expensive that she often has to choose between putting $20 worth of petrol in the car and eating. Teresa loves her job and has more than two decades of experience in the home-care sector. But, in order to cope with rising costs, she's had to take a second job in a local clothes store. She says she 'simply can't function' without an additional source of income. These are incredibly tough times, and, unfortunately, Teresa's story is not unique. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For other families, the high cost of living means choosing between filling prescriptions for potentially life-saving medicines and providing for their families. The co-payment for general patients has doubled since 2000, and, according to ABS figures, more than 900,000 Australians delayed or did not get a script filled in 2019-20, due to cost. To provide optimum health care to all Australians, we've got to turn this around. As the member for Newcastle, I am determined to deliver better outcomes for our community's future and for every household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is putting in place a number of measures to help ease that pressure on household budgets. One way we have done this is by reducing the maximum amount that Australians pay for their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or the PBS, as it's most commonly known, is a significant component of the Commonwealth's investment in our health system, with the government allocating $13.8 billion in the 2020-21 financial year to make medicines more affordable. The Labor government's changes, which came into effect on 1 January, mean that Australians are now paying up to 30 per cent less for their prescriptions. Our reduction to that co-payment means that the maximum Australians will pay for PBS medicines now is $30, down from $42.50. With this reduction of $12.50, 3.6 million Australians with current prescriptions over $30 will immediately save on medical scripts. People filling one script a month could save around $150 a year, while those filling two scripts a month could save around $300. In Newcastle, these changes will benefit 92,519 Novocastrians in filling almost 250,000 scripts each year. It's an estimated saving to Novocastrians of $3.5 million, and that is not to be sneezed at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed the first time in its 75-year history that the maximum cost of general scripts under the PBS has fallen. I am so proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that is taking direct action to help ease pressure on family budgets. We do not want to see patients having to choose between the health care they need and providing for their families. This change is just one way that we're helping to ease the burden on Australian families, particularly those with chronic illnesses. All Australians should have access to universal, prompt, and world-class medical care. That's Labor's mission, and it's our vision for Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I rise to support the member for Lyne's motion. I also wish to speak about what the nuclear industry could mean for Australia, particularly in my electorate of Flynn in Central Queensland. According to Labor's budget estimates, the next two years will see an increase in electricity prices of 56 per cent. How can these electricity prices be reduced? Australia has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and how can this be achieved? The answer is right in front of us. It is nuclear energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is the only G20 country not to have nuclear energy. According to the US Office of Nuclear Energy, nuclear is the largest source of clean power in the United States and is worth an estimated $60 billion to the country's gross domestic product. If that works in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere, why can't it work in Australia? Cost estimates for nuclear energy can range from $65 a megawatt hour or below, which is less than a new coal plant, to over $300 a megawatt hour, which is well above the high-cost diesel generators. A small modular reactor has a maximum energy capacity of 7,300,000 megawatt hours a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support for nuclear power is growing. A Lowy Institute poll last year found a majority would support removing the ban on nuclear power. In 2011, only 35 per cent of people were in favour of nuclear energy. Nuclear power is safe and has resulted in far fewer deaths than dam failures, oil rig explosions and even, on some measures, people falling while installing solar panels. Nuclear does less damage to the natural environment than other energy options. Wind energy takes 250 times more land than nuclear power. Solar energy takes up 150 times more land. Between 1965 and 2018, the world spent $2 trillion on nuclear energy compared to $2.3 trillion on solar and wind. Yet nuclear today produces around double the electricity of solar and wind. It is 95 per cent reliable, while solar and wind are 25 per cent and 35 per cent productive, respectively. The nuclear asset life ranges from 40 to 80 years, which is far longer than solar or wind projects, which average around 20 years. What people fail to recognise is that this means that solar or wind projects need to be installed and disassembled possibly four times in the lifespan of a nuclear asset. This is also not to mention the environmental impact of renewable energy, as wind turbine blades can't be recycled, so they're piling up in landfills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has 20 coal-fired power stations, which employ a total of 4,800 people. The Flynn electorate has three coal-fired power stations: Callide, Stanwell and Gladstone. On 28 September the Queensland Labor government announced plans to transition Queensland coal-fired power stations to a clean energy hub from 2027. So why don't we convert these power stations in the electorate of Flynn to nuclear power stations when the time comes? In the United States they are converting coal-fired power stations to nuclear plants, which provide tangible economic employment and environmental benefits to local communities. If we did this it would also not require the massive expense of rewiring the grid with high-voltage transmission lines that are required to connect solar and wind farms. You may simply plug into the existing system with a nuclear option.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have a nuclear reactor in Australia and have had for many, many years. The Lucas Heights nuclear medicine facility is right in the middle of Sydney. And we all know somebody who has suffered from cancer and has undergone radiation therapy. Lucas Heights is where this medical treatment is developed. So, to argue that nuclear technology is not safe is not correct. Australia has the world's largest known reserves of uranium, and we export it to over 40 countries worldwide. We have these reserves, so why not use them? It is rather hypocritical to have a zero tolerance policy in respect of nuclear energy when we provide the world with the primary source to make nuclear power possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it's important that Australia plans for the future, and I believe that nuclear power is the answer to our energy needs. To the federal government I say, let's have this conversation; it's time for an open discussion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I'd like to start by thanking the member for Lyne for yet another opportunity to have a conversation about nuclear energy. I'd like to remind the member that he and his party had the last nine years of government to implement some sort of effective energy policy. They had 22 chances with their stop-start energy policies to implement some sort of effective change. And now we see that Australians are feeling the crunch of the havoc in energy markets that they caused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we come here today and see that the opposition's solution is to look at an energy source that is the most expensive and the slowest to implement. I mean, I just don't understand why we're still here, having yet another conversation about nuclear power. Maybe they think that if they talk about nuclear energy for long enough then they can distract the Australian people from their failed energy policies, that they can distract them from the fact that they dumped their emissions intensity scheme or that they dumped their clean energy target or that they dumped three versions of the National Energy Guarantee or that they dumped a prime minister over their energy policy failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's one thing we know that the Liberals and Nationals in this place cannot dump, and that is their unhealthy obsession with nuclear power. So I did a little bit of research. The member who just spoke mentioned that we should start a conversation about nuclear power. Well, I thought I'd see how long the Liberals and Nationals have been talking about nuclear power. How long have we had to hear about the little radioactive carrot that they dangle in front of their radioactive base every now and then? And, believe it or not, they've been having this conversation for 68 years. <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> shows that Senator Spooner, in 1955, took to the dispatch box to praise nuclear energy. For 55 years they have been having this conversation, and we're here again today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Nationals talk about putting nuclear reactors right across Australia, but we all know the real facts, and I'll say them again. Just as they were told back in 1955, nuclear energy for Australia just does not stack up. It's too expensive, it takes too long to build, and we have no plan to get rid of the radioactive waste. You should have seen the list of reasons, Deputy Speaker, that I typed up as to why nuclear energy isn't the solution. But I've got only five minutes, so I've reduced it down into a little speech, and the next time this comes up, those opposite may want to listen to the speech again, because the reasons will be the same. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear energy doesn't pass any reasonable economic test, and it certainly doesn't pass the pub test. It can't be introduced or maintained without a huge cost to taxpayers, and it is the most expensive form of energy today—more expensive than coal and gas and, of course, more expensive than renewable energy. Even the industry itself, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2020</span>, said that nuclear, despite over half a century of industrial experience, continues to see costs rising. CSIRO and AEMO continue to produce report after report that has found that nuclear would be far and away the most expensive form of energy for Australia. Now they're talking about these small modular reactors, these silver bullets for nuclear energy. AEMO and CSIRO found that these reactors would cost $16,773 a kilowatt in capital costs—that's $5 billion per reactor—and that Australia would need 80 reactors. That's $400 billion for yet another Liberal energy folly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that to what this government is doing and what the world is doing: investing in renewable energy. Renewable energy is a proven technology with low cost, global momentum, investment desire and, importantly, near-immediate dispatchable power. Renewable energy is creating jobs in the cities and it's creating jobs in the regions. It's the cheapest form of energy available today, and it's only getting cheaper. And renewables can be built quickly, meaning we can transition from fossil fuels to emissions-free power generation quickly to help save our planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd hope that this motion would be the last time a member of the Liberals or Nationals brought up nuclear, but I know it won't be. They've been talking about it since 1955; they're talking about it in 2023. It's just a continuation of denial, delay and dysfunction. Australia has moved on; it's time to stop talking about nuclear.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise to speak on this private member's motion by the member for Lyne. We must remove federal and state bans so nuclear energy can deliver affordable energy security to our decarbonised electricity grid. Australia has been at the forefront of nuclear science and technology since the 1950s, when the Australian Atomic Energy Commission set up a research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lucas Heights is one of only 70 reactors worldwide capable of producing life-saving medical radioisotopes. We have one of the world's leading safety authorities to oversee the operation of Australia's nuclear industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in Senate estimates, a top federal bureaucrat needed help to answer questions about how Australia can achieve an uplift in transmission assets across the grid with the issue of rolling out thousands of kilometres of lines, especially to remote solar and wind farms in communities that struggle with towers on their properties. Most decarbonisation scenarios show that accelerating renewables deployment over time—access to the thousands of sites needed for renewables—will become increasingly difficult, as the best sites are developed first. Australia's leading systems engineers came to the parliament and warned us that, as the arms race to renewables takes off, land for lower-capacity sites will become more expensive and difficult to find. The energy they provide is intermittent, so we will have to import new community batteries every 15 years. Yet today environmental department heads could not give assurances that there will be enough batteries to sustain an 82 per cent renewable grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2050 policy says that everything from our cars, buses and planes to cement plants will be electric. We will need a 215 per cent increase on the 200 terawatt hours of electricity we generate now. Nuclear is the only low-emissions power generator that can operate reliably, regardless of weather. It has worked for 33 nations in six continents for generations. Australia has one of the largest grids in the world. We used to have the third-cheapest power bills in the OECD. We are now the third most expensive in the OECD, with the spot price reaching record highs last week. Labor claims nuclear power is not cost-effective. Why do more than 30 countries in the world rely on nuclear, with power more affordable than ours?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Engineers warn us that the total 60-year nominal capital cost of a renewable net zero option, including hydro, solar, wind and batteries, stands at over $1.2 trillion. The total 60-year nominal cost of nuclear power stations is less than half that at $594 billion. Nuclear is cheaper than renewables, it's familiar to Australia, it's already on submarines that come to our harbours, it's already in Sydney. This Labor government prefers scaremongering to listening to experts. It seems to think that if we build lots and lots of wind and solar, power will become as cheap as possible, but that is not the reality of things. These resources cannot match the demand of the grid, which must be met by reliable supply every second of the day and night. Instead, we will be left with an extremely expensive and highly volatile power system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear technology options are being manufactured to create reliable baseload power in Canada and the United States. We just need them here. The perfect sites for our nuclear power stations are our old coal-fired power stations, just as they are retrofitted in the United Kingdom. The existing steam turbine generators from old coal-fired power stations and their electrical distribution systems can provide nuclear power to the grid without significant modification, saving the pain and cost of building transmission lines for renewables, which threaten to carve up parts of Wide Bay. This is the only way we can reach net zero by 2050.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  First of all, I would first like to commend the member for Lyne for championing this issue. I think it's incredibly important that we clearly understand that the world is changing. Australia is going to be left behind again. The technology is racing ahead. We want smart manufacturing and well-paid manufacturing jobs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're missing out on these opportunities because of this Dark Ages mentality. We live in this quasi belief that all the other countries that are developing small modular reactors are somehow dumber than us. All these dumb countries, dumb countries like the United Kingdom, like France, like Scandinavia, like Sweden, like Czechoslovakia, like Argentina, like Canada, like the United States, like Russia, like China—we don't know completely what their purposes are—and like Japan. We had the ambassador from Japan in on the last sitting day in parliament. We posed the question to them about where they are with nuclear, because we all hear about Fukishima. They said, 'The issue we have is that Fukishima could have stood up to two earthquakes, but it couldn't stand up to a tidal wave.' We have to get on the record that the fatalities from the Fukishima nuclear disaster were zero. No-one died in the Fukushima nuclear disaster. That was not a small modular reactor. They are large reactors, and we should be on board with making sure that we avail ourselves of the opportunities—the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars—that are coming forward in this new industry. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was not amazed, but I think it has to be quite clear that the Australian people's concern about US nuclear submarines has been overwhelmingly non-evident. People don't care. What happens if one of these nuclear submarines comes into our port and turns on our light? Do we insist that they turn it off, because that's nuclear power lighting up our dock? What happens if someone runs an extension cord down to drill a screw in on the port or do something away from the nuclear submarine? Are you going to ban it? Where we have ended up right now is archaic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to understand that, if we are going to try to hit zero emissions, we are going to need sustainable base load power. We've seen the costs of Snowy Hydro 2.0. They're heading north of $10 billion. Renewables are incredibly expensive when you compare apples with apples—that is, 24/7 dispatchable—because they need the cost of pumped hydro, which is massive, or they need the cost of batteries, which is massive. Currently, the battery technology has no hope of delivering sustainable base load power. The quote we got in this building for how much it would cost for a battery backup at 24/7 sustainable power was $5 trillion. We don't have that money, so we have got to be smart and work around it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are they developing small modular reactors; we're also have process in Australia, such as with Professor Mark Ho, developing microreactors up to 50 megawatts. These are going to end up on Pacific islands. They're going to be all around the world, and we're going to sit back here and say we don't believe in them. It's like saying you don't believe in mobile phones, fridges or colour televisions. It's coming, and the smartest thing for us to do in this nation is get on board. In the coming months, they are going to blow up Liddell Power Station. They're not going to dismantle it; they're going to blow it up. Here is a place with transmission lines and connections. It would be the ideal spot for us to work towards having small modular reactors. Put it to the people of Muswellbrook. Tell them that their jobs stay, that everything continues on. Tell them about exactly where the technology is. I want it noted on the record that we support small modular reactors so in the future, when we get them—and they will turn up—we can refer back to this as those who were trying to make sure that Australia was on the front foot. If not, we continue on with this ridiculous process of a massive footprint of such things as wind turbines, which are disliked intensely in regional areas because of transmission lines, the footprint and the social upset they cause. Once small modular reactors come in—and they will—they will all be out of date.</span>

First, a question: who wants a nuclear reactor in their electorate? I know I don't, and I strongly believe that sentiment will be echoed and supported by communities in my electorate of Pearce. To be able to provide power on the scale needed under the coalition's nuclear energy plan, we would need to build 80 small-scale nuclear reactors around Australia. That would amount to a cost of $402 billion, or 17 per cent of GDP, which is 30 times more than the government spent last year on transport and communications and over 10 times more than the amount spent on defence. Nuclear energy has been looked into numerous times in inquiry after inquiry, including the Switkowski report, which stated that nuclear reactors would need to be built close to population centres.</span>

Let me remind all that, during the nine years of the Liberal-National government, we had 22 stop-start energy policies. Australians are feeling the crunch, and yet Peter Dutton's solution is to look at the most expensive and slowest-to-implement energy. The CSIRO has written numerous reports—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms ROBERTS:</span>
                  </a>  My apologies. The CSIRO has written numerous reports that found the cost of nuclear energy would be the most expensive energy for Australia. The CSIRO <span style="font-style:italic;">GenCost 2021-22: final report</span> estimates that electricity produced by nuclear energy using small modular reactors, or SMRs, would likely be approximately two to five times more expensive than electricity produced by renewables. To achieve the lower end of this range would require SMRs to be deployed globally in large enough numbers to bring down costs available to Australia. Even the nuclear energy industry itself admits that cost is a prohibitive factor compared with renewable energy. Clearly the better option is to invest in renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO's 2021 GenCost report confirms the past year's findings that wind and solar are the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia. Nuclear power plants create radioactive waste, plain and simple. We need to remember that management of nuclear and radioactive waste has been a continuing issue in Australia, and we do not currently have a permanent disposal facility for radioactive waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous governments have been searching for an appropriate location for approximately four decades. I ask: what is the opposition's plan to deal with the massive amount of radioactive material that would be generated from 80 SMRs around Australia. And once you figure out where it's going to be disposed or stored, you then need to contemplate how it will be transported there. The likely scenario is on a truck. Dozens of trucks carrying nuclear and radioactive waste across the country, collecting and depositing spent nuclear fuel rods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent incident in my home state of Western Australia caused worry and fear in the community when a tiny radioactive capsule was lost in transit. It is understood to have fallen off a truck. The emergency response was far from understated. Six days across 1,400 kilometres of highway with specialist teams using radiation-detecting equipment. Fortunately, it was found, but it could have been worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to consider what Australians want. Many Australians fear nuclear power because of safety concerns. In 2010 and 2012 an Australia-wide survey assessed Australians attitudes to nuclear power. And while Australians believe nuclear power offers a cleaner, more efficient option to coal, they were against nuclear power due to safety concerns and distrust. We are here to listen to our communities. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  Like most Australians I've been keeping a very interested eye on the energy space in our country, and indeed globally, over the last 15 years or so. This was long before I was in politics because energy is so crucial to our modern society. As a small-business owner I know we need reliable, affordable power. As a father and grandfather, I want energy that is as environmentally friendly as possible to ensure my children and grandchildren have a healthy planet to live on well into the future. As a Liberal, and therefore someone who believes in personal responsibility, I'm very much in the camp that believes it is not only the government's responsibility to do their bit, but it is also the responsibility of business and every individual to play their part in getting the energy mix right, ensuring that all three components of the energy mix—reliability, affordability and environment—are met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything in life is about balance, and energy supply is no different. Renewables have their benefits and their place in the energy mix, but realistically only as a supplement to a good baseload power source. Little is spoken about the detriments of renewable energy as many people see it as the saviour of the world. Yet many of the people in my electorate in Longman ask me questions. Where is the discussion around landfill when solar panels, wind towers and batteries reach end-of-life? Are we going to cleaner air but dirtier soil and waterways? Where is the discussion about volatility of lithium and its propensity to suddenly catch fire as we either sit on top of it as we drive EVs in the future or have it downstairs in battery storage as we sleep in our homes. What about the fact that we will need ugly solar and wind farms over three times the size of Tasmania to meet our baseload energy needs, not to mention the harm that that causes the environment by killing birds and clearing usable land? No, there is no discussion of any of this. That is simply ridiculous as we navigate our way through this energy transition stage. Not to mention the affordability issue, as we know that EVs are simply going to be out of reach of the Aussie battler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this critical time, we must look to other countries who have experimented with different types of energy. We must learn from their mistakes and adopt their successes. Nuclear energy has long been a taboo subject in this country because of events such as Chernobyl, Fukushima and various other reasons. But, as often happens with new technologies, they develop and improve over time, which is exactly what has happened with nuclear energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the privilege of being part of a delegation to Taiwan, which has had nuclear power for many years. They are now closing down their reactors. I asked them: 'Why are you shutting down nuclear energy in your country? Is it unreliable? Is it too expensive?' The reply was: 'No, it is purely political. We have many earthquakes in our country and people are concerned about the safety side.' I then said, 'Will the renewable energy you're replacing the nuclear with be as affordable and reliable?' I was given the reply, 'No, we accept that there will be brownouts at times and that energy will be more expensive.' Pressing further, I asked, 'If you were in Australia, would you have nuclear energy?' The reply was one word, 'Absolutely.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After much research and discussion, and from what I now understand about nuclear energy, I believe that it very much needs to be part of the discussion about Australia's future energy supply. The benefits of the reliability and long-term affordability, and the fact that it is very much considered a form of green energy, hold nuclear in good stead. Other benefits include that it can utilise the existing grid and coal-fired power station sites, which will save money on new infrastructure. This, along with Australia's stable landmass and our abundance of uranium, coupled with the now very safe, small modular reactors, have led me to this conclusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a layman, with no expertise in the energy sector. However, my desire is to have a balanced and pragmatic discussion around energy supply in this country, with all energy types on the table. This discussion and research needs to be carried out by stakeholders who have no financial benefit or preconceived bias about any type of energy production—it should be devoid of emotion and based purely on facts, with all aspects and cohorts of society considered in the discussion. The entire life cycle of all energy generation types, including for nuclear energy, needs to be considered, including reliability, affordability, environmental impacts, initial setup costs, disposal of waste and refining costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government is serious about energy in this country then it will include nuclear in the discussion, as we are the only G20 nation that doesn't have nuclear energy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion put by the member for Lyne. I am advocating for us as a country to investigate how we utilise the nuclear expertise, technologies and scientists already in our country, to investigate whether nuclear energy has a viable role to play in our country to assist as we transition to a decarbonised economy. I note that many in the government have extolled the virtues of renewable energy technologies, but these are not mutually exclusive with nuclear. I also support renewables. Why is it, though, that we cannot look at both options?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Hughes punches well above its weight in many areas. I am particularly proud that Hughes is the home of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, known as ANSTO, located in Lucas Heights. It has rightly been said in this motion that Australia has been at the forefront of nuclear science and technology since 1953, when the reactors were first established. ANSTO operates much of Australia's landmark infrastructure for nuclear science, research, innovation and technology. It contains the Open Pool Australian Light-water reactor—or OPAL—that's designed to produce the neutrons used in research and to promote radioisotopes. It is the only nuclear research reactor in Australia, and also one of the world's most modern. The ANSTO staff have showcased the facility to me on a number of occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ANSTO has as its mission statement to deliver knowledge, value and trust through the application of nuclear science, technology and engineering. It has three main priority areas: health, environment and nuclear technologies. In terms of health, its most important research areas are in human health and the biosciences. Human health researchers have expertise in the design and optimisation of treatment tools and methods using nuclear technologies; the modelling of complex radiation physics; and the use of nuclear techniques to understand the neurophysiology of the brain. The biosciences group at ANSTO is focused on the development and translation of radiopharmaceuticals to improve the detection and diagnosis of disease. ANSTO has the expertise and capability to supply radioisotopes and undertake radiochemistry, radiation biology and pre-clinical imaging studies. This work has been particularly invaluable for Australia's cancer patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Within its environmental priorities, ANSTO conducts and enables interdisciplinary research, using nuclear and isotopic techniques to address some of Australia's and, indeed, the world's, most challenging environmental problems. It has a primary focus on water resource sustainability, an issue which is integral to Australia. Using their capabilities in isotopic-tracing analysis, ANSTO scientists provide water resource managers with information on water quality and sustainability of groundwater resources and aquatic ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear technologies are also fundamental to ANSTO's work. Their research has addressed key scientific questions related both to the current generation of nuclear reactors and also to future systems. In particular, ANSTO researchers are investigating the key properties of nuclear waste, to improve safety for both short- and long-term storage. ANSTO's Education Team offers a wide variety of learning resources that align with the New South Wales curriculum, as well as providing education in science, nuclear technology and sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place, I said that with the significant environment and climate change issues that we face in Australia, combined with the energy crisis, I'm committed to approaching how we can utilise the nuclear technology and innovation at ANSTO to answer our energy questions. My 15-year-old self, who had posters of Midnight Oil throughout her bedroom, would shudder at this speech; however, the nuclear energy of 2023 is very different to that of the past, and I saw this most recently at COP27 in Egypt. As Australia transitions to a decarbonised electricity grid, it makes no sense to cling to old attitudes about nuclear energy and to stubbornly refuse even to investigate the possibility of nuclear energy in all of these circumstances. I commend this motion to the House.</span>
