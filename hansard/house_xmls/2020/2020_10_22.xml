              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago today this parliament, on behalf of all Australians, apologised unreservedly to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. It's a day that I will never forget. I'm sure it is a day that all the members of this chamber will never forget and the then Leader of the Opposition, who joined with me in that important apology, also will never forget—and nor should we. The parliament was full of Australians from all walks of life, some of those in this place also as members who know only too personally of these matters, all here to reclaim a part of their life or to honour a loved one who could not be with us. Through an action as gentle and as powerful as an apology, we confronted generations of suffering. Their stories, strength, courage and presence allowed us to confront some terrible truths: that for generations our country chose silence over truth, the powerful over the vulnerable and the reputations of institutions over the safety of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that day, we apologised for the pain, for the suffering, for the trauma effected upon victims and survivors. We apologised to their children and parents, to their siblings and their families, to those who have shared their experiences and to those whose pain is still too searing to share and, sadly, may forever be. As I said on that day:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… as a nation, we confront our failure to listen, to believe and to provide justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our apology didn't and can't undo our shared failures, nor did it return lost childhoods or bring back those no longer with us. But I earnestly hope it provided some small measure, some moment of solace to all those who suffered and continue to, and affirmed a national determination to never let those times be repeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the apology, I along with many others, met with members of the survivors reference group, who said, 'An apology without action is just a piece of paper,' and that is right. Today I will honour that sentiment and once again report further on our actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation of our response is the findings of the royal commission. Of the royal commission's 409 recommendations, 206 are directed wholly or partially at the Australian government. Eighty-four were about redress and led to the establishment of the National Redress Scheme, now in its third year. Of the other 122 recommendations, 45 have been fully implemented and 76 continue to be in progress and only one is still to be implemented. The government continues to work with states and territories on another 56 joint recommendations and we are playing a role in more than 50 additional recommendations that are primarily directed at the states and territories. Our first annual progress report was tabled in December 2018 and the second last December and the third will be done by year's end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Office for Child Safety has once again invited a range of non-government institutions to provide a report on their actions to keep children safe. Sixty-nine institutions have been invited this year. That's an increase on the 53 in 2019 and the 11 in 2018. The National Redress Scheme is now in its third year. It continues to support victims and survivors with the support they need. I can report the latest figures show 8,297 applications have been received. Of those, 4,670 decisions have been made. This includes 3,826 payments, with an average redress payment of around $82,000. This is a rapid increase on the 600 payments that I reported last year. I said then that this wasn't good enough. It wasn't, and we still have more work to do. This was why Minister Ruston announced a further investment of $11.7 million in the scheme. We're now in the process of reviewing the scheme with an additional $104.6 million to be invested over the next four years. This will ensure the scheme can meet victims' and survivors' needs. It will ensure the redress support services continue. And it will allow us to finalise the onboarding for the 158 institutions that have committed to joining the scheme, to be completed by the end of the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission, the apology and these yearly reports are about accountability: bringing the truth into the light. I'm reporting on 1 July this year six institutions were named as having failed to declare their intention to join the scheme. Since then, two of these have joined. We still have, reprehensibly, four institutions that have been named publicly and that have blatantly refused to join the redress scheme. They are Jehovah's Witnesses, Kenja Communication, Lakes Entrance Pony Club Inc. and Fairbridge Restored Ltd. It's not acceptable. We're currently finalising the further sanctions, that I know are supported by the opposition, that the Commonwealth will place on institutions who continue to refuse to join the scheme, including withdrawal of their charitable status for these offending organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these areas that the royal commission recommended the federal, state and territory governments work together on was a national strategy to prevent child sexual abuse. Unfortunately, progress to finalise the strategy has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. I know this is deeply disappointing for everyone involved, including the government, but let me reassure the House the government will deliver this strategy and we are now expecting it to be finalised in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic saw the National Office for Child Safety redirect its efforts over the past several months. It has focused on supporting organisations, sharing resources with states and territories and progressing policy work within the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Efforts continue on implementing the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework. This framework sets minimum standards for child safe culture and practices within Australian government entities. New resources are also being developed to help children and young people understand that they can speak up when they feel unsafe and how. This work is being spearheaded by the Commissioner for Children and Young People, Western Australia, with funding from the national office and will be available in December. Other resources are also in the works, including supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and communities to implement the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations in a way that is culturally safe and relevant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to announce that additional investment is being made to expand the Australian Child Maltreatment Study. This is the first national study of its kind, and it looks into the prevalence and health impacts of all forms of child maltreatment in Australia. The results will be released from September 2023 and will help guide Australia's child safety policy priorities in the years that follow and well into the future. It will be a key tool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I quoted a survivor who said, 'Let our voice echo.' My response was, 'May it ever be so.' My government's commitment to this, to ensuring the voices of victims and survivors are remembered and heard, will be enshrined in permanent form with a national memorial. The memorial will be built here in our nation's capital. The budget allocated funding for the memorial and it is expected to be completed in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our actions are about not only the past but protecting Australian children now and into the future. The safety of our children is the first priority of all of us. That's why, in the past year, we've strengthened our laws to reflect this. We've introduced a range of new offences. We've increased maximum penalties. We've introduced mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious and repeat offences. We've also made it easier for agencies to investigate and prosecute child sexual abuse. We've created offences for Commonwealth officers who fail to protect children under their care, supervision or authority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well, we've put more resources into responding to reports of child sexual abuse and we're working closely with our international partners to make sure the digital industry plays its part in protecting children online. I acknowledge the work of Australia's eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, and her efforts in schools and universities, working with young people and those institutions, helping to keep our young people safe. I can report that we are on track to launch the National Centre for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse next year. The centre will put a national lens on improving outcomes for victims and survivors, reducing stigma, raising awareness and understanding, and, of course, preventing child sexual abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said two years ago that we can never promise a world where there are no abusers, but we can promise a country where we commit to hear and believe our children. That is what we reaffirm again today together. This is our shared and constant responsibility together, a responsibility I know in this place we are all determined to meet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  Childhood should be the haven of some of our most wonderful memories—a time when the world is filled with the brightest sunshine, when the future is exciting and every dream feels like it will one day come true. But for so many of our fellow Australians, when they look back at their childhood, that's not what they remember. Instead of sunshine there were shadows. In the places they should have been safe, they weren't. Instead there was fear, betrayal, shame. The destruction of the innocence of a child is an evil thing. Trust was shattered. Institutions that should have been the cornerstones of our society were instead the rot at the heart of it. For many who suffered, the future looked impossible. So many took their own life and never saw this debate and the change that has happened with recognition across the board by our society about the evil that was perpetrated. The daily reality for too many children was a society that wouldn't believe them, a society that forced its own shame onto the shoulders of those it refused to hear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That finally changed with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I'm very proud to have been a member of the cabinet that made that decision. The royal commission was set in train by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. She has a lot to be proud of from her period as Prime Minister, but no decision was as gutsy as that one. That's because there was considerable opposition to it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The courage of the survivors who gave their testimonies has not lost any of its power to humble us. Seventeen thousand survivors came forward—17,000—to smash the conspiracies of cruelty that had tried for so long to silence them. Eight thousand shared their stories, many for the first time. Last year I was asked to go to dinner with a friend I went to university with. I didn't know. He'd never spoken about his personal experience. He wept over dinner as he recounted the difference that giving evidence made to his life—not just through that process, but through the courts system—to achieve justice for a childhood taken away from him, in his case by the Boy Scouts. More than 1,000 gave written accounts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I want to acknowledge the great leadership shown by Leonie Sheedy from CLAN. She made her presence felt. She demanded that those in power use their power to make a difference. She travelled the country urging survivors to speak up. Then she told her own story. What happened right across the country was a dam burst of truth. Survivors spoke for themselves and for those who couldn't yet raise their voices, and they smashed into that corrosive culture of concealment, that culture which routinely gave credence to the abusers over the abused. This meant that those who should have protected abused children instead doubted, shamed and silenced them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this day, two years ago, we reached the culmination of that royal commission. We gathered in this place and heard the Prime Minister and my predecessor Bill Shorten say the words that so badly needed to be said, the words that so desperately needed to be heard. Of course, an apology could never repair all the pain. It could never undo the suffering of a life darkened by a childhood lived under the shadow of violence and fear. It couldn't bring back those who had been worn down by the weight of a truth they'd had to bear alone, and who did not live to hear the words, 'We believe you.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the apology did mark the end of one era and the beginning of a more hopeful one, and the Prime Minister today has outlined the progress that has been made and recommitted the parliament as a whole to do better, which we need to do. Here in this place, we finally extended a hand to the survivors and to the memories of the victims. It is a very good thing that we will have the national memorial in this, our national capital, in 2022. As I said last year, the fact that survivors accepted that belatedly extended hand will stand forever as an act of grace. We thank them. It took an inner strength that most of us can never understand. The testimonies that survivors gave to the royal commission are online. When the truth is right in front of us, there is no reason for us to ever again become a society that chooses to look away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the royal commission handed down its report, that certainly wasn't the end of it; nor did it draw to a close with the apology. This is a process that goes on. The National Office for Child Safety continues its work in implementing the recommendations of the royal commission. The National Redress Scheme must continue to hold institutions to account and offer support to survivors. And we in this parliament will take the action that the Prime Minister has suggested against those institutions that can't show just a little bit of decency in responding and joining that scheme. So we stand ready to work with the government to get the scheme working as it should, to deliver survivors the redress that they deserve, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission. Each year we will join here in parliament and reaffirm the apology and everything with which it is imbued, because we cannot allow ourselves the false comfort of considering the job done and then letting it fade from memory. We will always hold in our hearts those who didn't live to hear the words: 'We hear you. We believe you.' And, to the survivors—the gracious, patient survivors—I say this: after all those years in which you suffered beneath stifling layers of silence, we will not leave you to recede into the quiet once more. May the past two years have brought you somewhat closer to the peace that you deserve, and may some of that long-lost sunshine find you and warm you at last.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on a number of 2020-21 budget measures which will provide additional support to individuals and households impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19. These measures build on the significant support already provided to the community through the social security system, such as the first two economic support payments and the coronavirus supplement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the economic response to COVID-19, the Morrison government will provide two further economic support payments of $250 each at a cost of $2.6 billion. Around five million payment recipients and cardholders will benefit from these payments. The first payment will be made in the lead-up to Christmas, and the second in the new year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensioners, certain concession card holders, recipients of family tax benefits and carer allowance who are not in receipt of a primary income support payment, and recipients of certain DVA payments will be eligible if they are residing in Australia. Each member of a couple will receive the payments if both are eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments are also made to social security law to recognise that because of the economic impacts of COVID-19, many young people will have lost a job or been unable to attain employment, which would otherwise have contributed to them meeting the independence requirement to qualify for payments. Schedule 2 of the bill supports young people whose path towards demonstrating independence through work has been disrupted by the economic impacts of COVID-19. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2021, the six-month period between 25 March 2020 and 24 September 2020 will automatically be recognised as contributing to existing workforce independence criteria for youth allowance. For example, under the amended definition of independence, a person applying for youth allowance will be considered to have worked 30 hours per week for the six-month period, regardless of actual hours worked. Regional students will be considered to have worked either 15 hours a week or earned 75 per cent of the national training wage schedule in the six-month period regardless of actual hours worked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without this change, many young people may not be able to meet the independence criteria and may be unable to access income support if they plan to go on to tertiary study. This could cause young people to delay their study in order to work to meet the independence criteria. The same concession will be available to Abstudy recipients, through changes to the <span style="font-style:italic;">ABSTUDY Policy Manual</span>. It's estimated this measure will assist around 4,000 young Australians by providing them with the financial support they need whilst they build skills and knowledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill will make amendments to create temporary incentives in the income support system to encourage young Australians to undertake seasonal agricultural work. The Australian government is spending $16.3 million to help address concerns across the agriculture sector about immediate workforce availability for the upcoming harvest season. Young Australians claiming youth allowance (student) payment who demonstrate participation in agricultural work throughout the forthcoming harvest season would have access to the new independence criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments mean that a person who earns at least $15,000 through employment in the agricultural industry between 30 November 2020 and 31 December 2021 will be considered as independent for the purpose of youth allowance (student) from 1 March 2021, subject of course to the parental income threshold. This change will shorten the period of time a young person engaging in agricultural work will need to work to demonstrate financial independence for the purposes of youth allowance. The same concession will be available to Abstudy recipients, through changes to the <span style="font-style:italic;">ABSTUDY Policy Manual.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill introduces a revised paid parental leave work test period for a limited time. The Australian government will provide $130.4 million for the paid parental leave program to introduce a temporary change that will enable people to access parental leave pay and dad and partner pay who do not meet the current work test provisions because their employment has been affected by COVID-19. This would enable most individuals with a genuine work history pre COVID-19 to qualify for payments under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. It will ensure over 9,000 individuals would regain eligibility for parental leave pay, and is expected to increase claimants of dad and partner pay by over 3½ thousand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to qualify for payment, people claiming paid parental leave must meet the current work test requirements, in which individuals must have worked for at least 10 months in their work test period, and for just over one day a week, with no more than a 12-week gap between any two consecutive working days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently to meet the paid parental leave work test, individuals must meet the work test requirements in the 13 months prior to the birth or adoption of their child for parental leave pay, or prior to their period for dad and partner pay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will temporarily extend the paid parental leave work test period from 13 months prior to the birth or adoption of a child, to 20 months for parents who have had their employment impacted by COVID-19. The change will apply to births and adoptions that occur between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 5 of the bill implements a 2020-21 budget measure that addresses inconsistencies in payments that are available to families affected by stillbirth and infant death. The bill will increase and align the amount that eligible families are able to access after a stillbirth, or a child's death shortly after birth up to the child's first birthday. The bill also removes discrepancies within the payments system in respect of multiple instances of stillbirth or infant death within the same family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, when a person has a stillborn child they may receive stillborn baby payment as a lump sum, subject to meeting an income test. Under existing arrangements, stillborn baby payment is paid at a high rate for the first stillbirth and a lower rate for a second or subsequent stillbirth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 January 2021, this measure will increase and align family assistance payments to families who lose their child through stillbirth or because their child dies before their first birthday. There will be one rate of stillborn baby payment equal to the current higher rate and an amount equivalent to the maximum family tax benefit part A bereavement payment for a child aged under 13 years. The bill will also make amendments so that a top-up amount (equivalent to the difference between the high and low rate of newborn supplement) is paid to families for children who received the low rate of newborn supplement and whose child dies before their first birthday. It is estimated that around 900 families are tragically impacted by stillbirth and infant death that will be assisted through this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 6 of the bill makes technical amendments to child support law to allow alternative figures to be used in place of the male total average weekly earnings and average weekly earnings trend figures, which are usually published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for the purposes of child support assessment calculations. From May this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has temporarily suspended publication of trend estimates for all average weekly earnings series, due to the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market. Child support law does not currently permit alternative trend figures to be used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces several beneficial measures that continue to provide enhanced support to the Australian community in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19. I commend the bill to the House</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I'm glad to make a contribution to the debate on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Government's poor handling and chronic delay in delivering meaningful regulatory reform for waste management and product stewardship in Australia".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, this package of legislation formalises a state of affairs triggered by the China sword policy and subsequent developments that have meant countries in our region—Malaysia and Vietnam, as well as China—will not receive Australian waste for recycling in the future. But Australia needs to go much further than that if we are to take full responsibility for our waste, reduce its serious and unsustainable impact on our environment, make use of it as a valuable resource and show leadership in our region. These bills establish a framework for the phased ban on the export of certain waste materials, and they also absorb the regulatory framework previously contained in the Product Stewardship Act 2011 while making some minor substantive changes to product stewardship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's little doubt that one of the reasons for the export bans we are required to put in place is that the waste material we've been exporting was of relatively low quality and involved relatively high rates of contamination. What's worse, while we assumed the material was going offshore to be recycled, the reality is that in some cases the rubbish was being burned, buried or thrown into rivers. It would rightly appal people in our communities to think that the plastic they were putting in the yellow-topped bins for recycling was being baled and transported to another country where, in fact, the rubbish contributed to local environmental damage and perhaps even became marine plastic that found its way to our part of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we put in place new export ban arrangements, I think it's fair to observe that it's the decisions taken by other countries that have forced us here in Australia to recognise that what we call our waste recycling resource management system has to a considerable degree been a collection and transport system. Our achievements when it comes to the key measures of a more sustainable approach—namely, to avoid creating disposable products, to reduce waste material, to reuse as much as we can and to recycle what can't be directly reused—have been fairly slight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To take plastic as an example, because it represents a particularly harmful fugitive and long-lasting material, on a per capita basis we generate more than 100 kilograms of waste plastic a year, and yet we recycle barely 12 per cent. Globally we know that 10 million tonnes of plastic go into the ocean each year and that's expected to triple by 2040, not least because global production of plastic is galloping ahead. Global production of plastic has increased 20-fold since the 1960s. It's going to triple again by 2040. Microplastic is already accumulating in fish and birds, and there's evidence that in some parts of the world it's accumulating in humans. That is very, very far from the expectations of the Australian public. As a nation, when it comes to waste we are still a long, long way from the expectations of our community, especially young people. And we're a long way from supporting the ambitions and the efforts of innovative companies, switched-on community enterprises and forward-looking local governments around Australia. We also have no strong basis currently for hoping and expecting that other countries, including developing countries in our region, will make dramatic progress to reduce plastic pollution when a developed country like our own is performing relatively badly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear in saying that Labor supports the passage of these bills because of the common sense and the necessity of the export bans, but we wish that this legislative package had taken the opportunity to do substantially more than that. I do take the opportunity to thank the assistant minister for his active and constructive engagement on the legislation. While I have a strong view that more needs to be done, it needs to be done differently in a number of respects, I recognise that the member for Brisbane has a longstanding and a genuine interest in this area of policy and he wants to see change. I'm grateful that we're able to achieve agreement to a number of amendments, which will be proposed and considered in due course. Of course, I wish we had been successful in getting a few more changes over the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's right that this legislative framework should be subject to a five-year statutory review period, rather than the 10 years initially proposed. Let's not forget that the statutory review period of the Product Stewardship Act, which is being subsumed in this package, fell due in 2016 and that wasn't delivered until this year. As we remember that, a number of the key waste targets we have before us fall due in in 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad amendments will be proposed that make the process of granting exemptions to the export licence requirements more transparent. I'm particularly glad that the consultation requirements with respect to the minister's priority list will be strengthened and expanded in their scope. While Labor believes there should be an independent statutory body charged with this responsibility, as the product stewardship advisory committee was previously, it's important that the government's new Product Stewardship Centre of Excellence be a mandatory point of reference. It will be for the government to ensure that the centre is structured and resourced in a way that allows it to provide uncompromising advice based on independent, environmental and industrial expertise. As I say, there are other changes we believe should be considered by way of amendment, especially with respect to the issue of harmful and unnecessary plastic and packaging, and we'll get to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also repeat the broad point that Labor believes a more comprehensive reform of product stewardship regulation is required and, unfortunately, that can't be achieved, in our view, by spot-fixing these bills. Having said that, I want to acknowledge the work of the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council, the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association and ACOR for their engagement with the opposition—and I'm sure with the government—on these bills, and for their leadership more generally in the cause of achieving a paradigm shift in Australia's waste and resource management industry. This is a sector that employs 50,000 Australians and it contributes over $15 billion annually to our economy. It's already a significant industry and a large employer and it will be better for all of us if it grows considerably in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Boomerang Alliance, Sea Shepherd, the WWF and the Plastic Free Foundation for the enormous effort they've made, and continue to make, in building community support for the change we desperately need in order to live sustainably and to live without poisoning our environment. It's a good thing that we're finally looking to take greater responsibility for our own waste. Judged on its own terms the export ban framework is broadly sensible and workable. Of course, it gives effect to an approach agreed by the Commonwealth with the states and territories. But what we need to hold on to as we make this reform is how much more there is to be done and how little has really occurred since Labor stepped into the national leadership space by creating the national waste strategy and accompanying Product Stewardship Act a decade ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I have to say it was a little bit odd to hear the Minister for the Environment make the claim when introducing these bills:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I'm incredibly proud to introduce this package of legislation—representing the first time ever a Commonwealth government has shown true commitment to taking on this important environment, and economic, policy reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is frankly hard to reconcile with the fact that, from 2013 to now, in the seven years of this government, precious little has been done on waste and recycling. Really we as a community are only lucky that, as with climate change and renewable energy, the states, territories and even local governments have responded to the inaction of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government by stepping up their effort. Labor went to the election last year with a commitment to introduce a national container deposit scheme. Fortunately, it is now the case that container deposit schemes are being implemented by states and jurisdictions around the country. But how much better would it be if this were being done on a coordinated and harmonised national basis?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about a sustainable approach to waste, it is not long before we find ourselves talking about the concept of a circular economy. That is not what we have now in Australia. What we have now is a linear economy that results in an unsustainable drain on resources, with a corresponding impact on our environment. What we have now is an economy that sees limited materials sunk into ultradisposable products, many of which are used for only a few minutes before being chucked away. It is senseless and unsustainable. It is quite literally a waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, in a circular economy, materials are seen as a resource to use minimally and to reuse and recycle to the maximum degree so that in many cases the products we make and use are part of a closed circle. In addition to being environmentally responsible, moving to this approach holds out the prospects of creating new resource-recovery and manufacturing opportunities and related jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But at this stage we have to be realistic and acknowledge that we are not very far along the circumference of that circle. Our economy is still one in which resources and materials are used and wasted in greater and greater quantities and, in some cases, are being used and wasted at a faster rate. So, in terms of our ambition to create a circular economy, taking the step of banning the export of certain materials is a relatively small one and we should hold on to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond that step it does get harder. Firstly, we have to ensure the material doesn't simply get stockpiled or put into landfill, and both have occurred over the last couple of years as our ability to export waste has disappeared and various industry players have found themselves in trouble, either financially or in some cases through fires that affected our already limited infrastructure. Beyond that we need to make pretty substantial strides in a number of areas, and I'm going to outline a few of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we need a large jump in scale when it comes to our recycling and reprocessing infrastructure, and that requires appropriate strategic investment. That is No. 1. Secondly, we need to support demand for recycled materials and related products, and that requires procurement policy. Thirdly, we need to fix the market failure so that producers take responsibility for the life-cycle costs of their products. In some cases they may be required to meet certain design and material specifications. This can only occur through effective product stewardship regulation. Fourthly, we need to improve consumer awareness and the means by which Australians can know and judge the recyclability and the recycled content of various products. That will enable higher recovery rates and mean people will know what to do when they are throwing things into their yellow bins. It will enable the proper disposal and sorting of rubbish in the first place, which will make the lives of our recycling operators and their operations easier. But it also means consumers will be better able to support products and producers that do the right thing. The producers themselves and the manufacturers that do the right thing can justifiably market their genuine achievements. For all that to occur—consumer awareness, proper marketing and proper disposal instructions—we require a better approach to product labelling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On infrastructure, according to the report commissioned by this government, Australia currently has less plastic recycling capacity than it did in 2005. The same analysis suggested that in order to respond to the export bans that we are now contemplating we would need an increase in recycling infrastructure across the board of up to 400 per cent. But, even though the government knows the magnitude of the problem, it has been achingly slow to address the shortfall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember that after last year's election, in August, when the Prime Minister was overseas talking about Australia's leadership on waste and ocean plastic, it turned out that the so-called $100 million recycling investment package wasn't a lot more than a sticky label affixed to existing Clean Energy Finance Corporation funds. When we asked about that in December last year, we discovered that the ministerial direction needed to create the guidelines for the fund hadn't occurred. When we followed up in May this year, it turned out that not a single dollar had been loaned to support recycling infrastructure through the CEFC. This week it's been confirmed in Senate estimates that the CEFC funding remains untouched. It's also been confirmed that the $20 million National Product Stewardship Investment Fund has not yet made a single grant. So, of that $120 million of the Prime Minister's $167 recycling and investment package announced in May 2019, not a single cent has been advanced. That's 72 per cent of that package which was first announced in May 2019, nearly 18 months ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, in the middle of this year the government made another announcement in the form of the Recycling Modernisation Fund. The programs do sound similar, but at some point we have to hope they function differently, because, if you keep announcing funds and no money flows to support infrastructure and address the waste crisis, we're not going to see the change that we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In any case, as we now seek to increase infrastructure capacity, we must do so strategically. Australia is a large country, and we're not likely to be able to sustain infrastructure at a viable scale in every state and territory jurisdiction. That means governments and industry must consider planning for transport logistics and costs as part of their long-term strategy on a coordinated basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say that, while it's very welcome that some large companies, including companies in the beveraging and packaging business, have made commitments to increase reprocessing capacity, we do need government to be clear eyed about how the system as a whole develops. The lesson to be drawn from the current failed and broken market is that government must be prepared to shape and maintain a system that delivers on clear principles. It must be sustainable. It must protect the environment. It must protect Australian consumers. It must be fair between the various jurisdictions in Australia and between people in urban and regional Australia. It must not lurch from being one kind of dysfunctional market to another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On procurement: we start by recognising that, while we can look to increase the quality and the quantity of recycled material, if there's no market for it, there's going to be a big problem. Government procurement is one way of building demand. The other way is through recycled content requirements. At the moment, we are seeing neither. In March the Prime Minister held the National Plastics Summit, with the only announcement of any substance being a promise to improve Commonwealth procurement guidelines, and we are still waiting for that to occur. It's in the government's National Waste Policy Action Plan that procurement guidelines with targets will be delivered by the end of 2020. It's nearly the end of October, and we are waiting to see those guidelines and those targets—targets that should be by volume, by value or by both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On product stewardship: we have to get a serious move on when it comes to ensuring that producers take responsibility for the life cycle of their products, especially when they are particularly wasteful or environmentally harmful. That's the essence of the broken market as it stands: those costs and that harm that come from poorly designed products that end up in our environment, our waterways and our oceans are not being borne by the people who make them and profit from them; they're being borne by the environment and all us. It is the definition of a market failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the decades since Labor created the platform for product stewardship regulation, not a lot has occurred—certainly nothing since 2013. It's currently the case that the minister updates a list of targeted products annually, yet on very few occasions have any of the several environment ministers within this government taken the opportunity to talk about product stewardship in this place. The five-year review of the Product Stewardship Act, which fell due in 2016, was supposed to be provided in the beginning of 2018 but actually arrived in July this year and didn't contain much that we didn't already know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's rightly acknowledged that the one co-regulatory scheme in existence, Labor's National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, has worked pretty well. It's also recognised that voluntary schemes have been underwhelming, underperforming and beset by free-rider problems. Yet not one new product has been listed for a co-regulatory or mandatory scheme since the government was elected, and even the accredited voluntary product stewardship schemes have fallen from two down to one—I know that's about to change. It's also worth noting that, even with the computer and television scheme, there's been a consistent issue with compliance, and that's an important part of these kinds of regulatory arrangements. The government, unfortunately, responded by cutting the staff employed in the relevant section from seven, back in 2013, to three recently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the need to improve product stewardship and despite the long delay involved in getting us to this reform opportunity, this package of bills does not substantially change the existing product stewardship framework. Now, instead of simply updating the list, the Minister for the Environment will have the ability to make recommendations and outline a time frame in which she expects those recommendations to be acted upon. It's an improvement, but it's a small improvement. It's essentially, on the face of it, a waggle-the-finger and tap-the-watch kind of mechanism. How well that works remains to be seen. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, based on what we've seen to date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the current situation with respect to disposal and recycling labels is a real mess; nobody could argue with that. Results of a recent independent audit showed that 50 per cent of products had no disposal labelling whatsoever; only 40 per cent had a recycling claim, though in some cases the recycling claim was unclear or wrong; and only 28 per cent of Australian products used the Australasian Recycling Label, an initiative launched and partly funded by the Morrison government. We need to do a lot better in the labelling space. I know the assistant minister is focused on that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill puts forward a reasonable approach for formalising the fact that other countries will no longer take our waste for recycling. We have to face up to the fact that we have drifted along for a long time with a severely underdeveloped resource management system. The legislation is, however, a missed opportunity to do what needs to be done on a more comprehensive basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, since the last election, has made a song and dance of its intention to do something serious about waste and recycling. I think that's because they're more inclined to do something in this space than in other areas of environmental importance. We know they're not particularly interested in climate change. There hasn't been a lot that's encouraging with respect to the review of the EPBC Act to date. The two key recommendations of the EPBC reviewer, Graeme Samuel, were national standards and a properly resourced independent agency with teeth. That second, key part of the recommendations was dispensed with before the interim report hit the desk. So the government wants to make a virtue of waste and recycling. But we're still waiting to see that change. We're going to see these export bans, but we're waiting to see all those other things happen—infrastructure, procurement, product stewardship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, all the targets in the glossy strategy documents that we all read grow closer to their target dates without getting closer to achievement. We're supposed to see 70 per cent of plastic packaging recycled by 2025—50 per cent recycled content. But, on the 70 per cent of plastic recycling by 2025, we're currently at 16 per cent, and it's going to be 2021 in a couple of months time. We're supposed to see the elimination—the elimination altogether—of problematic and unnecessary plastics by 2025. It's very hard to see how that's going to happen, the way we're going, and at some point in the not-too-distant future we're going to have to be upfront with the Australian community about that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't hard to find examples of positive action in relation to waste collection and local clean-ups. It's not hard to find examples of local businesses that are seeking to model responsible and sustainable conduct. It's not even hard to find inventive new processes, and innovative businesses that are seeking to be directly involved in the task of waste reduction and the recycling and reuse of existing resources. I'm certain that, in the debate that follows, almost every single coalition speaker is going to name-check various businesses or organisations in their electorate that are part of this effort—and they should, because those organisations and those businesses deserve recognition—but we cannot get away from the big picture, and the big picture isn't pretty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what's easy: it's easy to pretend that waste is not a massive environmental problem and market failure and to pretend that, in any case, we'll deal with it by a few nifty innovations, by asking business nicely or, in some cases, by treating business to a few stern words of encouragement. We also know what's hard. What is hard is to plan and deliver serious and meaningful progress through reform on a national scale, because that requires leadership and action at the national level and it means substantial change to the way we do things now. We're dealing with a fundamentally broken market and a very poor set of waste outcomes, and all the beatific statements about innovation and enterprise are not magically going to fix that. If the government can't admit that to itself—if we all can't admit it to ourselves—and take the requisite steps to get Australia on a better path then we'll continue to pollute our environment, we'll fail to show regional and global leadership, and we'll miss out on the jobs that should be part of a circular economy.</span>

                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I'll start off by thanking the member for Brisbane and the member for Fremantle. Their contributions in this space have been extraordinary and show the people of Australia that both sides can work together on this. The member for Fremantle's speech was, as usual, eloquent and spoke to many of the fundamental problems and challenges we face in this space. There are, however, three points I would like to dispute with him. The first is his point that things are getting worse. There are any number of reports showing that, while things are not as we would wish them to be, our society, this nation, has made immense progress in this area and many other areas. Indeed, a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Factfulness</span> by Hans Rosling points to all the contributions and advances of humanity, both here and around the world, in making this planet a better place. It points out that our lives today are fundamentally better than they were even 20 years ago. So, while there is much to be done, much has been achieved. I think this should give anyone listening to this debate great hope that we can continue to do a lot more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I disagree with is that this government does not take climate change seriously. I know it is a line that is in the talking points of those opposite and gets trotted out quite often. It is, simply put, completely and utterly untrue. All of us on this side of the House have children, and some of us have grandchildren. We want this planet to be just as good after we leave it as the way we found it, if not better. We want to make sure that those who come after us have greater opportunity, not less opportunity. We understand fundamentally that one of the key drivers of the challenges we'll face in the years and decades ahead is climate change. How this nation, indeed how this planet, responds to that challenge will be key to what sort of planet we leave behind to those who come after us. It is both fundamentally error ridden and incorrect for anyone in this House to stand up and suggest that there is anyone here who does not take it seriously. I think it demeans the nature of the debate and makes this issue political rather than scientific. That's the thing that we should focus on, and I know the member for Fremantle fundamentally agrees with me on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing about which we do have a fundamental disagreement is the national container deposit schemes. The member for Fremantle has a preference for a national scheme; I actually think having the state schemes and allowing the states to experiment with different schemes is the way to move forward, because it is through that policy experimentation that we may actually uncover a far better scheme than could be developed by those of us in this chamber. I know that only the best and the brightest are allowed to enter this chamber, but it is possible that there are others in other parts of the country—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FALINSKI:</span>
                    </a>  Indeed, as improbable as it seems, there may even be some people in state parliaments in other parts of the country who also, from time to time, have good ideas. Who knows? It might be an accident. Nonetheless, our federation was designed to be competitive, to allow policy experimentation, and I think it's a good thing that each of the states is undertaking its own schemes and experimenting from those. If the time comes when we should have a national scheme, that will be the time for us to borrow the best ideas that we have seen implemented by the states and in other parts of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite would have us believe that we need to choose between economic growth and the environment. It is a false paradigm that has been created by communities in an attempt for vested interests to get votes. We as a government are choosing both the environment and economic growth in this landmark legislation which is forecast to generate an additional $1.5 billion in economic activity over the next 20 years, whilst the Australian economy will be turning over an additional $3.6 billion. We are supporting communities hit hard by COVID-19, aiding economic growth and helping the environment. This is the kind of smart policy in government investment that this nation requires to get back on its feet. We believe that this country is strongest when communities are brought together, which is why we do not use the politics of division when it comes to the environment and economic growth. This is especially the case when our nation is contending with a global pandemic that has affected the lives of countless Australians and caused untold grief. Economics, not ideology, drives policies like this, which creates jobs, powers the economy and helps keep our beaches clean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has never been afraid of commitment, which is why this bill is tackling some of the toughest environmental issues this nation is facing. From 2018 to 2019, more than 645,000 tonnes of waste was exported overseas. That is the equivalent of 40,000 shipping containers; if laid from end to end, they would span from Sydney to Canberra. We can use this material productively or we can allow it to destroy valuable land. Inaction is not an option when it comes to recycling, protecting our environment or encouraging our economic recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Building a resilient Australia does not stop with JobKeeper but requires a holistic approach to rebuild our way of life and environment after the bushfires. We cannot allow pollution and waste-control measures to become lax and for government to turn a blind eye during COVID-19; future generations of Australians will only end up paying for this later on. Creating a dynamic economy for the 21st century which puts working Australians at its centre has been my goal since I first entered parliament. We need an innovation-driven economy to fuel the kind of growth which will deliver higher standards of living for future Australians whilst supporting out retirees. As part of this, having a diverse economy with many innovative sectors will be critical in creating a shock-resistant economy and society. We are taking pre-emptive action with this bill in driving outcomes for Australians and helping to create a freer, fairer society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those Australians not in isolation, keeping active is important not only for general fitness but for supporting good mental health. Recycling is a cornerstone of keeping our communities clean so that everyone can enjoy them. It is part of supporting the healthy lifestyle for which Australians are renowned the world over. Whatever this government can do to support Australians during times of hardship, we have done and will continue to do. Our national obsession with fitness continues unabated and is more important now given the challenge of COVID-19. We're taking a holistic approach to supporting Australians and protecting their safety. Keeping our walkways free of waste and protecting our nature reserves requires a national framework to manage waste and recycling across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when our economic recovery is in the spotlight, it is critical that we do not forget the importance of our wildlife, our beaches and the environment. With the bushfires at the beginning of this year having caused mass devastation to rural Australia, on top of droughts, this government is taking a strong stand to support the environment which our rural communities rely on. The tourism industry relies on our natural ecosystem as part of their bushfire models, and it helps attract tourists from all around the world. Before COVID-19, Australia was one of the top travel destinations in the world. We cannot allow such an important sector, which so many Australian families rely on, to degrade. As a government, we are acutely aware that many people are doing it tough. In preparation for the post-COVID world, we are continuing to support our natural ecosystems to aid a speedy recovery and help Australians get back on track and back to business. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 institutes an export ban on waste plastic, paper, glass, and tyres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Commonwealth government brought together the states and territories as part of an extensive consultation process to ensure that the goals of this bill were met and agreed on by all involved. Yet again this goes to our view that Australia is at its best when we're working together to resolve real issues that affect our communities. There are many that do not see it this way and instead stoke the flames of division and conflict to help themselves at the expense of others. A collective approach to national issues is why this government has outperformed the rest of the world when it comes to our COVID response and as we put in place measures to hasten our recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An integral part of this bill is encouraging companies to take greater responsibility for waste that they generate. By incorporating the Product Stewardship Act 2011, companies are encouraged to design and create products more efficient in terms of waste. This legislation builds on this by increasing the number of opportunities for businesses to join in voluntarily with the product stewardship scheme to reduce waste and pollution. In cases where the scheme is not effective or where they are not targeted effectively in priority areas, the government will have new tools to intervene. This is not about introducing new regulation or increasing the burden on businesses to comply. It's about driving outcomes by creating jobs and using limited resources more efficiently. Green manufacturing is an area that will become increasingly important not only as we drive economic outcomes but also as we seek to protect our environment and use it more effectively, whether it be for tourism or otherwise.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The promise of our federation to all Australians is the opportunity to pursue their conception of a good life and to support their aspirations, provided they are willing to work hard. It is about institutionalising the quality of outcome, giving all Australians a fair go. During COVID-19 there are great challenges, and it's been deeply moving to see neighbours helping each other and coming together in this time of crisis. As a government, we cannot replace loved ones helping each other, but we can support healthy and vibrant communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Engaging productively with waste and recycling in a way that supports the economy rather than imposing a bureaucratic solution is a win-win. All too often solutions to problems result in more regulation for businesses, much of which is pointless and simply costs time, money and eventually jobs. Australia has some of the most stringent regulations and highest compliance costs in the world, and yet, compared to the rest of the OECD in this area, we lag behind. This is not because Australians are not innovative, hardworking or entrepreneurial. It is because the burden to be compliant with successive waves of regulation has stymied generations of small business owners and mums and dads who run simple businesses from getting ahead. Dumb regulations are the very antithesis of the promise and values of the Australian fair go, because only the big corporates actually have the finances to deal with increasingly complex legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where large multinational firms have departments dedicated to compliance in Australia, small businesses and young university graduates looking to do a startup are undermined. They are betrayed by the Canberra bureaucrats who are searching for a reason to exist and to increase their departmental budgets and their personal salaries. In effect, they are taking money out of the pockets of some Australians to find meaningless regulation and self-promotion. At a time when many are struggling to make ends meet, when businesses have been liquidated due to hardship through no fault of their own, there are still vested interests wanting to regulate further. There is no benefit to regulation which destroys opportunities for Australians. A smarter regulation agenda such as this needs to create jobs, not lose them, and support innovation and investment, not discourage it. This bill is able to pursue the dual goal of helping the environment whilst building a stronger economy. Rather than dividing communities, we are bringing them together. Instead of pursuing a healthier environment at the cost of jobs and innovations, we are supporting a new industry. This is the agenda that partners with aspirational Australians and recognises that they are the drivers of economic growth and are responsible for Australia's prosperity and success. As a government and as a party we are helping to build a fairer Australia for everyone. COVID-19 has meant that this is more challenging now than any time since the Great Depression. That is why bills which support growth, fairness and recycling are so important. For these reasons, I highly commend the bill to the House. </span>

I would also like to note that, on this side, we do not wish to seek division on this issue. We wish to work with the government and to come up with solutions that ensure that we become a global leader in recycling and waste, while making more jobs and growth possible. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to address the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills before the House. Labor will support these bills, but it must be said that they do not do a great deal to advance our nation as a waste and recycling leader. Nor do they provide a foundation for thousands of new jobs in a sustainable industry, an industry that is champing at the bit to convert waste into valuable resources and commodities. With the right vision and the right incentives, rebates and procurement regulations, we could see massive industry investment, councils contributing their waste and a renaissance in regional manufacturing, in areas like my electorate of Corangamite. Instead, these bills are a missed opportunity, and, true to Morrison-McCormack form, this legislation is more about the spin and less about the substance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am incredibly fortunate to represent one of the most beautiful parts of Australia. From the Golden Plains to parts of Geelong, the Otways, Bellarine Peninsula, the Surf Coast and towns along the Great Ocean Road, Corangamite is nothing short of incredible. People in my community are proud of our environment. They're proud of our magnificent coastline, its waterways and our iconic surf beaches. They want to look after our environment and, like me, they are passionate about recycling. They also know there is too much plastic in our oceans, impacting on marine life and, in turn, on our own consumption. There is frustration at the current recycling and waste crisis, frustration with the federal government that has been dragged kicking and screaming to act, and frustration with the many missed opportunities we've had over the past seven years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to turn waste and recycling into jobs and opportunities for our regions. The recycling of waste into useful resources makes absolute sense. It's good for jobs, it's good for our economy and it's good for our environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since China stopped taking our plastic and other waste in 2018-19, the failures in our system have been laid bare for all to see. Many people I speak to in my community have lost faith in our recycling and waste system, because they now know that so much of our recycling goes into landfill. We know that Australia lacks the ability to sustain a domestic recycling market that will protect our environment and meet the expectations of the community. Right now, we only recycle 12 per cent of plastics and 58 per cent of waste in total. Most of the remaining materials end up in landfill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the co-convenor of the Parliamentary Friends of Waste and Recycling, I find it unacceptable that there is now less capacity to recycle plastic in Australia than there was in 2005. Some experts have argued that Australia will need to increase its local plastic-reprocessing capacity by 400 per cent in order to effectively repurpose our own waste into valuable resources. It says everything about the Morrison-McCormack government that it took a ban on imports from China and several other key nations for them to finally act. But their actions are short-sighted at best and show little comprehension of what is truly required to deliver a world's-best-practice national waste and recycling program. The Morrison-McCormack government doesn't seem to understand the urgency. We should not be exporting gas, plastics, tyres and paper for recycling. We should be cleaning up our own mess right here in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this challenging setting, I would like to acknowledge the excellent work being undertaken by Barwon Water, servicing my electorate of Corangamite with all of the G21 councils towards transforming the region's organic waste into renewable energy and other recycled materials. This is a fantastic, exciting project that shows vision and commitment. But such local initiatives, while commendable, are not the answer to our national recycling crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills before us would introduce a ban on the export of certain waste materials and establish a new licensing and declaration scheme. They would also replace and slightly update existing product stewardship laws. These are welcome changes, but, as I've already said, they are woefully underdone. If we are to become a leader in this field, the government must stop focusing on voluntary schemes. It must introduce meaningful recycling targets. And we must work with industry to produce less plastic packaging and fewer products that cannot be recycled. These bills provide no constructive plan for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has a proud track record on recycling and waste. Labor in government created a national waste policy, establishing a national waste reporting process and introducing the Product Stewardship Act 2011. This was a major step forward in developing a regulatory framework to encourage responsible waste management in partnership with industry. But these measures were taken nine years ago and were meant to be only the beginning of reform, which has stalled dismally under those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that recycling is an enormous opportunity for Australia. Recycled goods can be turned into products that generate employment, can reduce landfill and support regions like mine. I truly believe that better recycling could be a game changer for my region and our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For every 10,000 tonnes of waste recycled, 10 jobs are created. We are in the midst of the Morrison recession. A horrifying number of Australians have lost their jobs. The queues outside Centrelink that we've seen this year are a national tragedy. As we come out of the COVID pandemic, the government must exploit every opportunity available to create more jobs locally, including those from recycling. In this federal budget, the government has set aside just $10 million for growing Australia's waste and recycling capacity. This will do little to see plastics turned into fence palings for council work, or to see recycled rubber in council footpaths and roads, or to see green organics composting on our local farms. There is so much opportunity for recycling and waste to support jobs and new industries here. But the federal government needs to lay the foundation to make this happen. Real outcomes require real investment. We need real leadership to provide confidence for industry investment. We need real leadership that enables local government to embrace waste and recycling on a massive scale, right across Australia, and we need real leadership on recycling incentives, rebates and rules around procurement at all levels of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">State and local governments in my areas are waiting for the government to step up. The G21 regional alliance is a group in my community which represents five local councils, including the Colac Otway Shire, Golden Plains Shire, City of Greater Geelong, Borough of Queenscliffe and Surf Coast Shire. These councils have formed a united front and are working with the Victorian government on reforming kerbside recycling to better sort waste, recycling and organics. But the absence of a federal government with a proper plan for waste and recycling, including financial and legislative support, means it is going to be just so much harder for councils, industry and groups like G21 to manage this crisis and embrace constructive solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've previously spoken out in the House and in my electorate about the potential for my region to become a national waste and recycling hub. We have potential sites, investors and numerous existing manufacturing technologies who have come to me and asked me to help them to do more to enable the creation of a recycling hub quickly. If only this government would get behind this as a national priority, this solution would result in hundreds of new jobs for my region, giving opportunities to a region suffering from a lack of tourism visitation, a struggling university sector and a lack of confidence in our economy due to COVID-19 and mounting debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community want to build with recycled materials, they want to work with recycled materials and they want to buy recycled materials. They do not want to see massive amounts of hard waste end up in landfill. Importantly, they want our oceans and waterways to be free of plastics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a real opportunity to become a leader in waste and recycling, but the Morrison government is failing to drive reform. It is failing to drive a robust framework that creates stakeholder confidence, and it is failing to invest in the job-creating opportunities that come with the recycling of waste. Ultimately, this government is failing our environment. The people of my electorate want to protect our beautiful environment, our precious coastline, our marine life, our waterways and our oceans. I urge those opposite to go beyond the media release masquerading as legislation and do more—much, much more—to address this crucially important issue. My region has the skills, the workers, the assets and the will to step into the future. The missing piece is a federal government with the vision to make it happen.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I'm very proud to speak in support of the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020. This is a subject which I and many of my constituents in the Ryan electorate are very passionate about. This legislation will go a long way to improving waste practices and changing the way in which we look at waste reduction and recycling in Australia. I want to acknowledge at the outset that the bill is the result of not just the incredibly hard work of the minister sitting at the table today, Minister Ley, but also the hard work of my good friend and neighbouring MP Trevor Evans. Minister Evans's appointment as the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management is telling of the Morrison government's commitment to waste management practices in this country, ensuring that we continue to live in a clean, green and sustainable Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently welcomed Minister Evans in a visit to the Ryan electorate. We were very pleased to have him on the banks of the beautiful Brisbane River, down there at Indooroopilly. The local creek catchment groups, in association with cleaner waterways associations, had discovered a very large rubbish patch on the banks of the Brisbane River. Minister Evans rolled up his sleeves and collected a fair bit of rubbish, as did I, and the crew was out there on the boat picking up rubbish as well. It's a great reminder to everybody in the electorate of Ryan and in the other electorates that front onto the Brisbane River catchment of the importance of keeping waste out of the waterways and the importance of continuous vigilance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 identifies the necessity for us, as a nation, to look after the waste that we produce and to deal with it here in Australia. In doing so, we will not only be taking responsibility for managing the waste that we produce but doing so in a way that is environmentally conscious and can further stimulate the economy and jobs, no doubt making Australia a global leader in this space. The bill will ensure that Australia's waste management reduction will be a truly transformative shift in our nation's approach to waste. It has the support of federal, state and territory governments as well as local governments. However, what will ensure the longevity of this bill in creating an ongoing shift in waste management practices is the years of extensive consultation with industry and business, which will see the positive benefits of this bill continue long into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill isn't just great for the environment; it is great for creating jobs—a priority of the Morrison government that is more important now, as we work our way through the COVID recession, than ever before. This legislation will go a long way to stimulating the economy and stimulating employment in the area of processing our waste. It is projected that the waste export ban will generate an extra $1.5 billion in our economy over the next 20 years and create hundreds of jobs. Let me say that again: the waste export ban will generate $1.5 billion in our economy and create hundreds of jobs. That's what you get from this side of the chamber; that's what you get from the Morrison government—a commitment not only to reducing our waste and to being environmentally sustainable but to doing it in a way that creates jobs, supports industry and supports our economy. This is certainly no small sum. It just goes to show that, when there is a government and a side of politics that works with industry, as this side does, rather than trying to dictate to it, we can achieve outcomes that are mutually beneficial for business, consumers and, importantly, our environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I know Minister Evans knows, this government's pragmatic approach to policy has meant that we are going to have resoundingly better outcomes for business and the environment in a way which the Labor Party were never able to emulate during its time in government, in a way which the Labor Party can simply never achieve. They like to talk big when it comes to the environment. They like to talk it up. They like to have all the show and pomp and ceremony and all the rest of it, but, when it comes to actually delivering practical outcomes, it's the coalition governments of this nation that have delivered some of the most substantial, practical outcomes on the ground, while the Labor Party are too busy talking themselves up on this particular issue. That's why it's this government, a coalition government, that has delivered the first waste reduction bill, which we are debating today—another milestone in environmental management for our nation, delivered by a coalition government, not the Labor Party opposite, who like to stand up at every election and say they're the only ones in the world who can save the environment or who care about the environment and that the rest of us are philistines and all the rest of it. They couldn't deliver. They had plenty of chances. They were in government in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. They could have delivered Australia's first waste reduction bill. Did they? No. It is this government, the coalition government, the Morrison government, with the help of Assistant Minister Evans, who has taken the steps to deliver it. It's been achieved because we're working in a consultative manner with the industry and their reps. We're allowing for reasonable time frames to transition to our phase-out goal of 2024. Rather than dictating to industry with heavy-handed taxes and unnecessary regulation, which is the Labor way—if they see a problem, they've got to regulate their way out of it or tax their way out of it—we've ensured that we've enshrined in this bill that there is a way to have a more efficient and long-term change than has ever been achieved when it comes to environmental management by the Labor Party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 accepts that our country's management of waste and recycling is not perfect, and we take responsibility for the fact that we need to manage the waste that is created within our borders and we need to do it better. As a responsible actor in the international community, the government has acknowledged the impact that we as a nation have had in generating waste which negatively impacts our regional environment. The Morrison government has accepted that this is a vital challenge that we must tackle. We know that this is an opportunity in time to step up to the plate as a developed nation, to lead the way in forging a strategy, via this bill, that can be emulated by our regional partners. By banning the export of waste in this manner, we're both being environmentally conscious and recognising the impact of our waste but doing so in a sustainable manner that will bring industry with us, that won't destroy jobs and that will allow businesses a reasonable time to adjust their business model and their employment opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that businesses, in particular small businesses, are the backbone of our economy and face enormous pressures in keeping millions of Australians in work, particularly during this time of the COVID recession. But we do ask that business take responsibility for their own waste. This will be achieved through incentivising businesses to recognise the impacts of their product and where they end up throughout the entirety of the product's life cycle. So many businesses have done so much in recent years, proactively, to this effect. They have much to be proud of in terms of what they have done already, and we are proud of what they have achieved. This bill goes further and incentivises businesses to audit their own products and recognise the impacts they may have later in the product's life cycle. Through working in lock step with affected businesses and industry, we will then be able to achieve better outcomes by taking collective responsibility. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a plan that will ultimately divert 10 million tonnes of waste from landfill to be reutilised in a more sustainable fashion. Diverting 10 million tonnes of waste—that's the merit of this bill. It's extraordinary and it's going to make a remarkable impact on the face of Australia in waste management. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill looks at waste recycling differently and acknowledges the potential opportunity rather than the burden waste presents. We previously looked at waste as a problem rather than an opportunity for further utilisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brisbane City Council, which I had the pleasure to be part of for almost 10 years, has been doing incredible work for some time from a local government perspective when it comes to environmental management and waste reduction. They are an important partner with the federal government. Under the leadership of Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner they have developed a strategy to incorporate over 20,000 tonnes of salvaged glass from landfill into road base and, in the process, they have saved their ratepayers $3.6 million. This is the kind of innovative stuff that can be done when you view waste as an opportunity—an opportunity to save money and to create jobs—and you take that approach rather than viewing it as a burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brisbane City Council, with the assistance of federal government funding, has also developed a trial to incorporate discarded car tyres into bitumen, to make use of discarded tyres and in doing so create a formula which will make bitumen more durable and longer lasting. These are innovative and forward-thinking approaches from a local government. We have seen the same sort of innovative and forward-thinking approaches replicated by local governments around Australia. They are saving tonnes of waste from going into landfill and saving ratepayers' dollars as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge Brisbane City Council's leading efforts in Australia as Australia's first carbon-neutral council. The first carbon-neutral council in Australia is not a Labor council. It's an LNP council. An LNP council that has had LNP leadership since 2004 has been the first council to take the step to be entirely carbon-neutral. That's the difference between Labor, who are all talk on this issue, and the coalition and LNP parties, who are about practical steps and implementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just local government and federal government who are doing their bit. Many major supermarkets have incorporated soft-plastic bins into their shopping centres to make it easier for consumers to dispose of plastics which are not recyclable, electronic stores are taking in unused mobile phones and even Rotary clubs across the country are collecting bottle tops to be reused for prosthetic limbs. So there are some fantastic stories out there to be told, and we need those individual efforts to continue. The bill won't replace them. The bill will simply work in conjunction with them by bringing together industry, business and government so that we can collectively work to create better outcomes for the environment, create jobs and save taxpayer dollars in the long term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Assistant Minister Evans has worked hard to ensure that the industry has a realistic time frame in which to meet the requirements set. The ban on unprocessed mixed plastics will be in force under this bill by 1 July 2021, on whole used tyres by December 2021, on single resin or polymer plastics by July 2022 and on mixed paper and cardboard by July 2024. It's an ambitious but reasonable time frame that will allow businesses to judiciously adjust to those new bans. As the party of small business, we know that it is only when businesses are brought into the conversation that we can successfully achieve our goals. The ban placed on waste products is restricted to unprocessed materials, and businesses will still be able to apply for licences to export processed waste that is in line with industry standards if they are willing to do the work to process the waste in a way that is environmentally sustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Collectively, with this bill we will divert over 10 million tonnes of waste, create over 10,000 jobs, pump an extra $1.5 billion into the economy and, most importantly, help safeguard our environment for future generations. The residents of my electorate of Ryan aren't single issue focused. They care about all these things. Of course they care about supporting their environment, but they also care about creating jobs. They also care about a strong economy. The fact this government is able to achieve all of those goals together by working with industry and by enshrining it in this bill is an incredibly clear testament. It's a clear testament that it's only under the stewardship of an LNP government that we can create such a universally accepted approach to waste management. The Morrison government will continue to work tirelessly to create pragmatic policy that is good for the environment, good for the economy and good for jobs, and on that note I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  [by video link] Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. It's nice to see you. I hope to be up there in Canberra with you all in the not-too-distant future. Listening to the member for Ryan give his contribution was a little perplexing to be honest, because the member for Ryan spoke about his time and his friends in the Brisbane City Council, about how he was rummaging around and busy supporting a carbon-neutral Brisbane City Council. My advice to the member for Ryan is: if you're so enthusiastic about carbon neutrality maybe get your government to commit to net zero emissions like the rest of the world, maybe join the rest of the states, maybe join the Business Council and maybe join the Farmers Federation in actually committing on a pathway towards carbon neutrality. But of course they're not going to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened carefully also to the member for Mackellar, who spoke about how the Labor Party likes to make political hay about climate change. That's because the government's not doing anything about it. It's not hard to see why when the Prime Minister, instead of actually taking action on climate change, tries to use recycling as the excuse for his inaction on climate change. But we all know that the member for Mackellar, the member for Wentworth and the member for Goldstein are part of a very small group of MPs on their side of the House who have to sit in the corner of the party room, whose views are not really allowed to be expressed openly, because the views of others in the party are far more prominent, like the views of Senator Rennick, who accused the Bureau of Meteorology of having a conspiracy and fudging the weather data—that's a view that reflects the views of the government—or Senator Molan, who said that he doesn't take into consideration evidence when forming his views on climate change, or even the member for Hughes, who just flat out denies that climate change is a thing altogether. They're actually the views that represent the views of the federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that the Labor Party takes a very, very different view. The Labor Party takes a view that we need to move forward and we need to take action on climate change, on emissions and, of course, on protecting our environment. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and related bills before the House are bills that we would support. The huge changes in the recycling sector have meant that Australia needs to take more responsibility for our waste reduction and our waste products. Unlike the government, we don't believe that everything should be done by the states. We believe that the federal government should have an active role in steering, in funding and in moving Australia towards a more circular economy and towards better management of our recycling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not up in Canberra at the moment. I'm home in my electorate of Macnamara. Last night I was watching an episode of<span style="font-style:italic;"> Utopia</span>, a great show, where the characters were talking about the future infrastructure fund. It was a $100 billion fund where they were going to take money now, put it in a fund, but not spend a cent. It was going to be about future infrastructure. Of course, there were infrastructure needs at that moment. That episode highlighted how the future infrastructure fund is all about the future. That can be a pretty good analogy when art imitates the life of this government. I remember the Prime Minister set up a $100 million recycling fund—$100 million! He put it on a brochure. Of course, we now know that 72 per cent of that announcement hasn't been spent. The government's answer to dealing with recycling is to copy the world of <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia </span>by setting up future funds—'Let's put it in a glossy brochure; let's put it in a media release'—but not actually do anything about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government isn't good at recycling products, but one thing this government is good at recycling is announcements. They love recycling announcements. There's not an announcement they won't use again. They'll use the same one time and time again to resell an initiative but not actually do anything about it. The $100 million recycling fund that the Prime Minister announced on the world stage was actually a re-dressed announcement of money that already existed in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government are not actually interested in doing things and moving the dial forward. What they are interested in doing is recycling announcements and making sure that everyone knows how glossy their marketing products are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have set themselves targets around recycling which, just like the emissions reduction targets, they are nowhere near on track to meet. It's 'say lots, do little'; that's their approach to recycling. They've got lots and lots of plans and lots and lots of announcements, but they haven't actually set up a pathway to be able to achieve their 70 per cent reduction by 2025, and we're currently at 16 per cent reduction. This government really, really needs to do better. And that comes, unsurprisingly, amid broader failures on environmental reform and emissions reductions, which all go hand in hand. We cannot separate plastics, recycling and emissions reduction from habitat destruction, biodiversity destruction and the really serious state of our environment right across this country and, obviously, across the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about local action to contrast action taken locally with the action—or the lack of action—by the federal government. In Macnamara, we are so lucky to have such a wonderful coastline around our electorate. We're right on the bay. My electorate goes from Port Melbourne all the way down to Elwood along the coastline and then cuts inland a little bit. We take great pride in our local beaches and we take great pride in our walkways and our waterways. At the last election, we actually had a policy for cleaning up some of the waterway that travels through my electorate and out into the bay. It was a great initiative that locals were really excited by, and I can assure you that it hasn't been taken off the agenda. It's something that whoever is in charge should be looking towards, because the quality of the water in the bay in Melbourne and through Melbourne is important, and it affects the biodiversity of our bay and the biodiversity of our waterways. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other great work happening locally that I wanted to mention is, first of all, to do with the Port Phillip EcoCentre—and, on Sunday, I was very pleased to attend their AGM. The eco centre is one of the jewels in the crown of our local environmental organisations. They do brilliant work around monitoring biodiversity, and on plastics—the use of plastics, where plastics end up, the effect that plastics have. They also help and contribute to some of our really special wildlife hotspots, from Elsternwick Park to the St Kilda pier and its penguins. They are a brilliant organisation, and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise them and also to put on the record again my personal support for their potential redevelopment. They are looking to create a local hub for education and environmental management in St Kilda, at their current premises. They're looking to create a centre of community use and environmental management. I was pleased to support it at the last election and am fully supportive of the project right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like also to acknowledge BeachPatrol, who spend their weekends basically protecting our bay and protecting our beaches. These are locals who give up their time to make sure that the plastic that we use and that ends up on our beachfronts is collected and doesn't potentially affect the wildlife and the marine life in the bay. BeachPatrol, including my friend Ross and his team, do a wonderful job, and I'd like to give them a shout-out for all their efforts in working towards reducing the plastic and recycling imprints on our local area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely crucial when speaking about recycling that we mention the government's really appalling efforts in relation to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The EPBC Act should be the linchpin of environmental protection and habitat protection. Among the key recommendations of the Samuel review, as mentioned by the member for Fremantle—I acknowledge his contribution and leadership in this policy area—are to have a federal regulator and to have strong national standards. It is not enough just to deal with the recycling issues that these bills confront. It is also crucial that we make sure that we are protecting habitats and protecting biodiversity locally and also protecting the animal life that exists. The government had a brilliant opportunity to strengthen our environmental protections and do something profound, something that this country would remember as a great part of their legacy in environmental protections, but they couldn't bring themselves to do anything like that. Instead, they rushed through a bill on which they gagged debate in the House of Representatives for no good reason. They just knew that they didn't want to talk about it for any longer, because it was such a disaster for environmental protection in this country. What a stain on their legacy that is. The environment and natural habitats will be around a lot longer than the Morrison government, and, instead of doing their bit to protect our natural environment, the Morrison government's legacy will forever be that they rammed through a bill that weakened environmental protections in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are a step forward, but they are nowhere near enough. The government needs to stop recycling announcements. The government needs to stop doing glossy brochures and glossy media releases around recycling funds and future recycling funds and all the things that the Prime Minister likes to focus on. Instead, it should be looking at the proper reforms to reduce the amount of plastic production, to increase circular economies and to increase business accountability on the products that businesses create. It should also be supporting businesses to ensure that they have a shorter-lasting imprint on our environment. We are custodians of this land. We are custodians of the waterways. We came to this country with a responsibility to look after it. The way in which this government constantly trashes the environment, trashes any legitimate climate policy and trashes its responsibility to protect our natural habitats and wonders will forever be a stain on the legacy of each and every member of this government. I acknowledge that there are a few members of the government who seek to sound different and have a unique voice in an overwhelming tidal wave of irresponsibility when it comes to environment, recycling and climate change, but the public know and the experts know that this government has failed on all of those accounts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, in the Labor Party, remain committed to properly protecting our environment. We remain committed to doing our bit. We remain committed to supporting the wonderful local organisations that we have, like the eco centre and BeachPatrol and many others. We wish the government would take a leaf out of their book, instead of the inaction that has riddled this government each and every step of the way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I rise to support the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills with an immense sense of pride. This bill is pragmatic, practical and what the Australian people want and expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia generates about 67 million tonnes of waste each year and only 37 million tonnes are recycled—that's about half of our waste that's recycled each year. We can and we should do better. Only 12 per cent of the 103 kilograms of plastic waste generated per person in Australia each year is recycled and this is mostly overseas. This waste problem isn't unique to Australia, but this waste problem is a problem that the world needs to face together for the safety of this planet. A European Union report estimates the production of virgin plastic will account for 20 per cent of global oil consumption and 15 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This is a looming problem that needs to be dealt with now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians rightly assume their council rates, which include a rubbish collection levy, pay for their waste to be appropriately dealt with by the council and the company who collects their bins every week or fortnight. But, in my home state of Victoria, the looming problem of waste and what to do to manage it came to the fore about 18 months ago—that seems like a lifetime ago now. In a very sudden announcement, almost overnight, residents in 33 local councils across Victoria were told that they would no longer have their allocated recycling collected. This was because of the collapse of a particular recycling company. That, coupled with a series of warehouse fires that were storing rubbish, in particular car tyres, blew the lid on the practices of recycling companies—literally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most average Australians dutifully separate their recyclables from their rubbish and compost every week, placing the appropriate waste in the right coloured bins. But what most Australians didn't know—and perhaps they do now—is that there's been a long history of most of our kerbside collection being shipped overseas to China for processing. When China made the decision to stop importing waste from the rest of the world, the rubbish collection industry went into freefall. Factories were forced to stockpile, resulting in rubbish of all varieties—recyclable and non-recyclable—ending up in landfill. This was incredibly disappointing, considering the leaps and bounds Australians made in understanding, educating and actioning recycling principles, and consciously making more sustainable choices in their daily lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure I have the support of all members in this House who've visited local schools in their electorates and seen the incredible work that our students do on recycling. It was hard to look these kids in their eyes when this disaster happened. We know these kids care about their planet. We know they're enthusiastic recyclers. We know they care about their future, and so do we. And so began a blame game in Victoria between the industry, the Victorian Labor government, who failed to see the writing on the wall, and councils, who were responsible for handling our local waste. Well, enough is enough. The Morrison government has decided to step in and take charge. And I want to thank the member for Brisbane for his passionate leadership in this area as Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management. I call him our waste warrior.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation we have a duty and a responsibility for our own waste. We can't just pass the buck to other countries to deal with. That is why I support the bill with a great deal of pride today. This landmark bill seeks to ensure Australia takes responsibility for its waste and establishes a national industry framework for recycling. The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 will work to end the 640,000 tonnes of rubbish—including plastic, paper, glass and tyres—that Australia ships overseas, mainly to China. As Australians, we should all welcome the $190 million commitment for the new Recycling Modernisation Fund announced in the budget recently,  plus the $60 million for the National Waste Policy Action Plan that will improve our waste data collection and halve our food waste by 2030. It will also provide the basis for those who design, manufacture and distribute products to take greater responsibility for the impacts of these products on the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, 'It's our waste; it's our responsibility.' The Australian public expect this and the Australian public deserve this. We are putting this incredibly important issue firmly on the federal government agenda, not leaving it to the states and territories to go it alone. We will work as one across the three levels of government to solve this problem for Australia. The new 2020 national waste policy will work with Australian environment ministers from all states and territories and with the Australian Local Government Association to set a unified direction for fixing our waste crisis now and into the future. This legislation will not only reduce the amount of products that go to landfill but tackle plastic pollution in our waterways and oceans and give Australians confidence that, when they put their recycling bin out, their waste will be collected and recycled properly and responsibly, not simply dumped into landfill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources, on which I sit proudly, is currently undertaking an inquiry into the Australian waste management and recycling sector, to understand how we can build the sector to meet our country's demands. The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia, in their submission to the inquiry, highlighted numerous benefits of re-examining our recycling habits and, ultimately, restructuring the framework for dealing with our waste and recyclables. They sum up quite succinctly the benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to remodel waste management across the board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, they suggest transforming and modernising Australia's economy to enable it to be more sustainable. We must think of our material management as cyclical, not linear—a holistic approach to managing our natural resources, with strong leadership encouraging rethinking and redesigning that enables greater use. For those of you who are technically orientated—geekish, perhaps—I encourage you to go to the inquiry's website and view some of the amazing submissions about how Australians are now thinking about a cyclical rather than a linear approach to recycling. There are some amazing technologies that have been presented to the inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they suggest the preservation of resources and accelerating the decoupling of economic growth from the use of fossil fuels. This is important, because we need to have a complete shift in our mindset on waste—in fact, not seeing 'waste' as waste at all, but more as a resource that can be used again and again and again. Plastics is a great example. Once processed, it can live lots of different lives in lots of different forms. We've heard about this in the recent submissions to the inquiry into waste and recycling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there's a focus on the creation of local jobs and the growth of local economies. We are hearing this more and more, particularly from rural and regional electorates, where local communities embrace the opportunity to be waste warriors and to benefit economically from this. It's important to remember that good waste management is not just an environmental problem; it's an economic opportunity to create and rejuvenate the sector. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste recycled, more than nine jobs are created. Our actions under the National Waste Policy Action Plan will create 10,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. That's a 32 per cent increase in jobs in the Australian waste and recycling sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the plan stresses the importance of investment in the sector in both infrastructure and operations. With no guarantee that products made from recycled materials will be purchased, invested in or innovated, the industry dries up. I welcome our national government's procurement plan, ensuring that procurement through government sources can invest in this industry. This will ensure that they've got an economic plan ahead. The submission notes we must place greater emphasis on creating end-markets, or demand, for recycled materials, to generate investment in infrastructure and innovation. Investment, innovation and growth in this industry ultimately supports job creation, and this is critical as we cast our minds to our COVID pandemic economic recovery. Fifthly, they state, 'Waste management in the recycling industry ultimately supports the achievement of climate goals.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the Morrison government released the low-emissions Technology Investment Roadmap, which is a very welcome development as part of our goal to develop a long-term climate strategy that appropriately balances environmental and economic concerns. It's technology, not taxes, that is key to meeting and beating our international climate change goals. We know how important recycling and waste are to emissions and our emission reduction goals. Innovating in our waste management and recycling industries supports this goal. It's something that the public wants. It's something that the public enthusiastically supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy from waste is the treatment of residual waste to harness energy from material that would otherwise be landfill. I was pleased to visit recently the Woodlawn Eco-Precinct as part of the inquiry into recycling and waste to see some of the wonderful technologies that are being brought online. The energies are created by either thermally processing waste at high temperatures and using heat to make steam or digesting the organic material to produce gas which can be used for fuel, electricity generation or heat. Currently, small- and large-scale anaerobic digestion technology is being developed across Australia and makes a meaningful contribution to resource recovery and renewable energy generation. This is a 'watch this space' area globally, and Australia needs to be in line with the technology development in this area. It's exciting and promising work which should, hopefully, grow to form an important part of the energy mix in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, waste and recycling may not be the sexiest topic under consideration in this place, but its importance both now and into the future cannot be understated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  [by video link] I also rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and the plans for this bill to introduce a much-needed ban on certain waste materials, including glass, plastic ties and paper. Labor will support these bills because there is actually no time to delay when it comes to responsible waste management and protecting our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Introduced by the Gillard government in 2011, the Product Stewardship Act was a major step forward in developing a regulatory framework to encourage responsible waste management in partnership with industry. It was the foundation for the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, which is still the only co-regulatory arrangement and has been largely successful. Since then, virtually nothing has been done by the coalition to build on this progress. That is seven years wasted—excuse the pun. It took a ban on imports from China and several other nations for the coalition government to make a move on this and to act on waste and recycling. How can you take this government seriously on waste and the environment when their signature election commitment, the $100 million Recycling Investment Fund, is simply a repackaging of the existing Clean Energy Finance Corporation? More than a year after it was first committed, the fund remains untouched.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime it has been clear that there is a serious deficiency in Australia's recycling capacity. We have lower capacity to recycle plastic than we had in 2005. Product stewardship is a critical element of sustainable waste management. It's fair to expect that the designers and manufacturers of products will take responsibility for mitigating environmental impacts by seeking to reduce waste in the first place and also by enabling reuse or recycling and incorporating these costs into their business models. The government's own review found that growing numbers of industry free riders are the primary factor that leads to a failed voluntary scheme, yet their apparently limited response is to facilitate a form of naming and shaming that may influence businesses to take responsibility. If that doesn't work, they have promised to consider a stronger approach at a later time. This is too much talk and not enough leadership or action. We don't really have time to wait and see. There is a set of targets to be achieved under the national waste policy from 2018, and we can't afford to wait and see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that the much-needed progress on waste and recycling requires some semblance of national leadership, which is lacking at the moment. I will say that we as an opposition, federal Labor, are up for the challenge. We created the first national waste policy in 2009, establishing a national waste reporting process, and introduced the Product Stewardship Act, under the Gillard government, in 2011. We were glad to note that the long-delayed statutory review of that act confirmed the fundamental value of Labor's policy, particularly in relation to the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, which I mentioned earlier. Further improvements to compliance that now come under that scheme are both necessary and welcome. Labor has consistently argued for strong national action on plastics and recycling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, the Morrison government continues with its failed business-as-usual approach to the issue of waste management. It continues to create media events, like the so-called Plastics Summit in March, whilst taking little or no action or large-scale reform at all. That means worse environmental outcomes but it also means we miss the opportunity to develop new and innovative manufacturing processes and jobs. We need to move towards eliminating single-use plastics and maximising plastics recycling through better design, producer responsibility, improved infrastructure and effective policies on procurement and recycled content requirements. All these measures should be delivered through a nationally coordinated and strategic approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that Australia lacks the ability to sustain a domestic recycling market that will protect our environment and meet the expectations of the community. Up to eight million tonnes of plastic makes its way into the world's oceans every year. The global consumption of plastic could triple by 2040. In Australia, we only recycle 12 per cent of our plastics and 58 per cent of our waste in total. Some analysis indicates that Australia will need to increase its local plastics-recycling capacity by some 400 per cent to recycle and reprocess our own waste into useful and valuable resources. We have a very poor record on plastics in particular, yet Australia stands to be heavily affected by plastics pollution in our oceans, which are so important to us as an ocean continent. As with the issue of climate change more broadly, we are not doing our best to build regional cooperation in reducing plastics across the Indo-Pacific. I think we can do much better by leading by example and demonstrating that we can be leaders in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, however, a lack of leadership in the government's own budget recently. The Prime Minister made energy announcements and left out renewable energy entirely. He focused only on the threat of funding new gas projects. Labor's policy is for Australia to become a renewable energy superpower. If elected to government, we will implement policies that will achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Renewable energy will power our future and tackle the climate crisis. As the Leader of the Opposition said recently, the market tells us that the cheapest forms of new energy are renewables. In his recent budget-in-reply speech, he detailed Labor's commitment to making Australia a renewable energy superpower and highlighted one area in our energy system that desperately needs government attention, the electricity grid. Our Rewiring the Nation plan will invest $20 billion to rebuild and modernise the grid for the renewables age. Australia's complex tangle of electricity grid connection and congestion and system strength issues is quickly becoming a major barrier to the next big wave of renewable energy investment. The reality is that the grid was not designed for renewables and small-scale generators. So federal Labor is committed to making Australia a renewable energy superpower; rebuilding our electricity grid for the future; driving the transition we need to tackle climate change and create thousands of new jobs; maximum plastics recycling through better design, producer responsibility and improved infrastructure; and effective policies on procurement and recycled content requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that we can come out of this recession stronger if we have the vision, if we have the leadership. Only we can deliver the massive reform that we need to both safeguard our climate and create the thousands of new jobs necessary to power that economic recovery. That's what leadership is about—having a plan for the future, which we've articulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in opposition and we will continue to be critical of the government's lack of action on waste, which so far has failed to deliver certainty for industry—for jobs—and for Australia's environment. While the reforms we're debating are not unwelcome, and nor is any other legislation or policy on this implemented by this government, we don't think it will be effective in building a significantly improved waste and recycling sector. It falls short again, in short. We need to see action from government when it comes to producer responsibility for waste, to procurement and to the strategic allocation of waste infrastructure if we are to see a major take-up of recycling here in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="274506" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  It's a pleasure to talk on this landmark package of legislation today, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills. I want to congratulate the Minister for the Environment, the member for Farrer, and the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, the member for Brisbane, on the work they've done over many months—in fact years—in putting this legislation together. This legislation is about Australia stepping up and taking responsibility for the waste that we produce, rather than shipping it offshore and outsourcing our responsibility. It's about Australia developing new waste-processing industries, creating new businesses and jobs and new products, and it's about the transformation of Australia's waste and recycling sector and the development of a circular economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Waste is an environmental problem to solve, and solve it we must, but it's also an economic opportunity to seize, and seize it we must. These bills will do just that. The bills have three main objectives. The first is to enact a prohibition on waste exports. Once that is enacted, the export of waste material will be prohibited unless certain conditions are met: that it is being processed into a value-added material or that it will be reused or used as a manufacturing input overseas. This will help phase out some 645,000 tonnes of unprocessed plastic, paper, glass and tyres that Australia currently ships overseas each year. The export of mixed plastics will be banned from 1 July 2021, whole used tyres from 1 December 2021, single-resin or polymer plastics from 1 July 2022, and mixed and unsorted paper and cardboard from 1 July 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this package of legislation addresses the issue of product stewardship. These bills will replace and improve the existing Product Stewardship Act 2011 and provide for three kinds of product stewardship scheme: voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory. The bill will encourage the development of a circular economy in Australia by enhancing voluntary product stewardship and supporting businesses to consider the full life cycle of products. It will encourage and, if it is needed, impose obligations upon manufacturers, distributors and importers of certain products to help manage the full life cycle of these products, from design and production through to reuse and disposal, and ensure that these producers take greater responsibility for the impact of these products on the environment. Overall, this will help improve the design, durability, reparability and reusability of products and help lower the overall environmental footprint of them—things such as batteries, printer cartridges, photovoltaics and others. The bills will also facilitate voluntary product stewardship arrangements and accreditation with a product stewardship logo that will let consumers know that they are making a responsible choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, these bills will help realise the economic and community benefits of processing waste in Australia. They will help create new industries, products and jobs, and they will be complemented by our $191 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, recently announced in the budget. This fund will help leverage around $600 million of recycling infrastructure investment. It will help create around 10,000 new jobs. It will help divert more than 10 million tonnes of waste from landfill. All up, this waste export ban is expected to generate potentially $1½ billion in new economic activity over the next 20 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources, of which I'm a member, has been conducting an inquiry into Australia's waste management and recycling industries, as my colleague the member for Higgins just mentioned. Through this inquiry we have learnt already how much of a contribution recycling is making in Australia. We've heard about the growing use of recycled crushed glass in road construction as an alternative material to sand. We've heard from the charitable op shop sector, in many respects the pioneers of Australia's circular economy—the first op shop in Australia was opened in 1880 by the Salvos—about how their business model has actually thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, through the roughly 3,000 charitable op shops around the country, some 285 million products a year are given a second life through reuse, diverting some 622,000 tonnes of waste from landfill every year and, in doing so, generating some $550 million in annual revenue for social welfare programs supporting disadvantaged communities and people. So the circular economy is already here in Australia. It's been here since 1880. These bills are about accelerating and growing the circular economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this inquiry, we've also heard from the National Association of Charitable Recycling Organisations about how a large amount of textile waste in Australia is still sent to landfill each year, some 679,000 tonnes. That's a resource recovery rate of only 12 per cent. If these textiles could be diverted to the op shop network, which has recovery rates of almost 90 per cent, a vast amount of waste could be diverted from landfill. The fashion and clothing industry in Australia needs to do a better job of taking responsibility for this, and it's an important message to all Australians: do not just throw out your old clothing; take it to the op shop. As NACRO told us, 'Clothing textiles donated to charities are a resource, not a waste.' So let's give them more resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard in this inquiry from the National Waste and Recycling Industry Council about how government can make an impact by addressing product stewardship regulations for batteries, packaging, all electronics, photovoltaics and tyres and establishing producer or manufacturer collecting and recycling services for these products. We also heard from them about how diverting more food and organic waste from domestic and commercial recycling bins would have a massive impact, given it accounts for some 50 per cent of the volume going to landfill. That's right: food and organic waste is currently 50 per cent of the volume that goes to landfill, and the decomposition of this food and organic waste without oxygen, which is frequently what happens in landfill sites, leads to the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect here and congratulate one of the local government areas in my electorate of Wentworth, the Randwick City Council, which has recently introduced a food and organic waste collection service. Unfortunately, far too few councils in the Sydney metropolitan area offer such a service. I urge other councils in Sydney to look at the Randwick City Council model and look to do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this inquiry, we've also heard from IKEA about its ambition to transform itself into a completely circular business by 2030 and its use of furniture buyback, which is now available for 10,000 articles, going back some 10 years, and which is now live in all 10 Australian IKEA stores. So far under this scheme, some 5,044 pieces of furniture have been returned, and this will only grow over time. It's a remarkable initiative, a leading initiative, from a company that is often known for being at the forefront of such innovations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extensive consultation on this bill over the past few years has been conducted, with discussion papers, industry roundtables, extensive engagement with states and territories and comprehensive stakeholder engagement. Again, I want to applaud the work of the assistant minister and the minister for the comprehensive task they have done in this regard. The feedback from these consultations has been incorporated into these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, in Australia we generate more waste per capita than in many other countries. We need to do better—better at finding ways to reuse goods, better at diverting products away from landfill, better at turning waste products into valuable inputs, better at finding ways to unlock and repurpose the value in much of what we currently dispose of and better at taking full responsibility for all we use and consume, throughout its life cycle. These bills are an important first step, and I commend them to the House.</span>

                    <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  Recycling is how we build our future—low emissions, low environmental impact and quality jobs. There is no reason that we can't have a big, thriving, growing recycling industry here in Australia that deals with our own waste. That's what this legislation and, indeed, the amendment are about. It's about taking responsibility for our own waste here in Australia—a principle that everyone in this place should agree with. We can't just ship our problems to other jurisdictions and at the same time be shipping the potential for scientific breakthroughs, innovation and indeed jobs away with them as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Fremantle for his amendment. He is a strong voice for the Western Australian environment and a strong environmentalist who acts in the national interest in this parliament. In my home state and the member for Fremantle's home state of Western Australia, we finally—and the South Australians would say that we took maybe a little too long—have a container deposit recycling scheme. That recycling scheme has already seen in just one month of operation some 10 million cans and bottles recycled, paying out 1 million dollarydoos to Western Australians and to many sporting clubs. I commend those sporting clubs who have found this a new and innovative way to fundraise, particularly when we know that this government has cut a range of sporting programs that they normally rely on because it can't administer them in the national interest. It was only able to administer them in its personal political interest, which was incredibly disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about the scale of the waste that we are dealing with, it is 67 million tonnes of waste a year. I can't comprehend how big a volume of waste that is. When almost half of it, some 30 million tonnes, is not recycled at all, we can of course improve a great deal. When it comes to plastic, every one of us in Australia on average generates 102 kilograms a year—and only 12 per cent of that is recycled, despite the fact that more than 50 per cent of it is recyclable. We are not meeting our objectives and our obligations to future generations if we don't get serious about recycling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 is to introduce a ban on the export of certain waste materials and is also providing some much-needed updates to the existing stewardship laws and amending the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme. It gives me fond memories of the first computer in my household, the Apple Macintosh Classic, which has now, I hope, been recycled—or it might be in a museum somewhere! I never had the joy of a Commodore 64, and I think anyone who has one would definitely not be recycling it. They would be getting a very high price on eBay for such a piece of ancient but important technological history. I hope that my Apple Mac Classic and the Apple PowerPC 570 that followed it and the HP Pavilion that followed that are all somewhere happy in recycling computer heaven. It is important that we do recycle all of these things because of the large range of rare and precious minerals that go into the manufacture of those computers, and the more we can recycle them the more we can lower the costs of computing power, which is obviously essential for our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banning the export of glass, mixed plastics, whole used tyres, single-resin or polymer plastics and mixed and unsorted paper and cardboard all makes really practical sense. For that reason, the Labor Party will support the bill but of course is seeking to amend the legislation to improve and broaden the impact of the scheme. Labor has a proud history of taking the lead when it comes to recycling policy. In 2009 we created the National Waste Policy, trying to start to build a product stewardship program and have a national waste process. This is something where, if we do it nationally and we get it right, there will be huge economic benefits for our country. We do not need to be shipping this waste overseas. But this legislation isn't perfect. The government's own review has found that growing numbers of industry free riders are refusing to take responsibility for products that they manufacture. This is the main reason that voluntary schemes fail. When we're only recycling about half of our waste, with the other half going into landfill, we are just creating problems for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to talk about some of the activities in my electorate of Perth, where we are trying to take action on this at a local level. I will start with the City of Bayswater. The City of Bayswater has Riverside Gardens, which was the dump for most of the Perth electorate and the inner suburbs in the north of the metropolitan area for many, many decades. Thankfully, Riverside Gardens has been, to some level, remediated and now has beautiful water-frontage parklands and a large, large patch of grass. The City of Bayswater's vision is to turn this old tip, which now sits very close to a large number of houses, into a new urban forest, as part of their efforts to reforest large parts of the City of Bayswater. I think that's appropriate and is something that we in this place should also look at—how we support the remediation of tips that have been really only partly restored to what they were before we started dumping our rubbish in those locations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did the count in the electorate of Perth: there are 23 buy-nothing, sell-nothing Facebook groups. That's not metropolitan Perth; that's just in the electorate of Perth. That is a sign that people are serious about doing what they can to avoid things ever going to a recycling plant or ever even going into landfill. The City of Vincent and the town of Bassendean are going to have FOGO—food organics and garden organics bins. These have been incredibly popular where they have been rolled out in other council jurisdictions. It's just another way that people could actually start the recycling journey at home by avoiding things going into landfill at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a shout-out to the workers at the City of Stirling's resource recovery centre. The City of Stirling's resource recovery centre will take almost anything that doesn't smell and recycle it—you can drop off your polystyrene, your cardboard, your television, your fridge. There are a bunch of really dedicated council workers who keep that facility running. I commend the City of Stirling for making that a free facility for the people of Stirling. As a resident of the City of Vincent, I am still allowed to cross the council border—one of the borders we can cross—and take my recyclables there. It's a great community resource. It's a great hub of activity for bin chickens in the metropolitan area and it ensures that people can access recycling in a convenient way to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally in relation to councils, before I talk to other matters on the bill, I want to say that it's time that the CBD of Perth had a proper recycling plan. We have huge numbers of businesses who should be doing more and could be recycling more. With the new mayor of Perth—and I congratulate Basil Zempilas on his election; it's a very exciting time for our city—I hope they can start some serious action on recycling action so that our CBD has a proper recycling plan that takes us well into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People of all ages in my electorate have campaigned about the need to do more on waste. I've spoken in this place before about the work that the kindergarten students do at Perth College. They have run their own recycling campaigns. They wanted to see less plastic being used by local cafes. So, rather than wait on all of us to get around to this, they decided they were going to start lobbying—these are kindergarten kids—local cafes with their poster to say, 'Let's do something to prevent plastic going into our environment.' They are possibly some of the more successful lobbying efforts I've seen in recent times. They've been incredibly successful with local cafes, and once again I commend them. They wanted to do something about plastics because they had learnt what we do know in this place, which is that plastics can affect our wildlife when left out in the open and not properly managed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conservative estimates are that plastic affects some 267 species globally. Eighty-six per cent of sea turtles have some impact from plastics in the ocean. Forty-three per cent of marine mammals are at risk of being harmed by plastics in our oceans. And 130,000 tonnes of Australian plastic, which we all use, ends up in our waterways and oceans each year. As member for an electorate on the Swan River, I know that, whenever we see plastic there, there are only two places it ends up—on our shores or in the ocean, and when it ends up in the ocean it harms sea life. The more we can do, the better when it comes to protecting our amazing coast and the animals that live there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier the WA Containers for Change program. Finally Western Australia has a container deposit recycling scheme. A huge shout-out to Stephen Dawson, the state minister, who led this change. It is well overdue and there has been an incredibly smooth start to this program. These programs don't always start smoothly, and that's often because there hasn't been a lot of hard work behind the scenes. On this occasion, there was lots of hard work behind the scenes, and I commend some of those who were intimately involved in it—particularly someone who is well-known in this place, my friend Hannah Beazley, who has worked very hard on that program. Hannah, you and your team have done an amazing job in communicating with communities about how they can have an impact. Equally, Reece Wheadon, who is a brewer in West Leederville—the lesser of the Leedervilles, given that it is just outside my electorate and I've only got Leederville itself!—who has also made sure that that industry is represented, and I congratulate Reece for his work on the board in terms of giving the WA Containers for Change program such a successful start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are things that we can learn from this in terms of how we go forward. There are still 1.3 billion beverage containers consumed in Western Australia every year. Not all of them are recycled. We will see in the next year whether or not this program does indeed generate an increase in recycling. What we do know, since the modelling has already been done on this, is that it will generate 600 jobs—600 new local jobs—in an environmentally sustainable way. That has to be a good thing. It's expected—and I hope this is an underestimate—that an additional 6.6 billion containers over the next 20 years will be recycled, and 40 per cent of those jobs that I mentioned are projected to go to long-term unemployed people, Indigenous people and people with a disability. Again, that's something I think everyone in this place can get behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, when it comes to management of waste and creative recycling, I just want to talk about REmida, a WA reuse centre based in West Perth. It started as an initiative of the Bold Park primary school—the Bold Park school, I should say; they also have a senior campus. In 2004, the teachers and parents of Bold Park Community School collected 1,000 containers of waste materials. They became the feature of an artistic installation which was set up in Forrest Place in the heart of Perth. The artwork inspired the community to rethink waste and possible ways that they could do more. REmida is now a community-run not-for-profit collecting industry waste, cut-offs and old stock that can be used in children's workshops. You only need to look at a day care centre or at pre-primary or early years education to know that the 'making table' is one of the hottest bits of property in an early learning centre, and making sure that there are things to make with is equally important. Organisations like REmida make sure that kids can make truly creative things which can then go into parents' homes for a new life, rather than going into waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already mentioned the 23 buy-nothing, sell-nothing groups on Facebook for Perth. We also have three toy libraries—again, making sure that children can access a range of toys without generating excess plastic waste. Local governments too are doing more when it comes to reducing, reusing and recycling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude my comments by saying that, whilst this is a step in the right direction, there is so much more opportunity for what this government could be doing when it comes to greater coordination across the federation in recycling and reusables. We don't always acknowledge the power that we have when we pool our effort and do more together. This legislation is a step in the right direction. I'll conclude my remarks there.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241590" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise in support of the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020. This bill will allow Australia to take responsibility for its waste and to establish a national industry framework that bans the export of waste glass, plastic, tyres and paper. The bill will also improve the framework of the Product Stewardship Act 2011 to encourage and regulate best practice in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to be part of a government that's so committed to driving Australia's waste-recycling industry forward. The bill will phase out the export of 645,000 tonnes of unprocessed plastic, paper, glass and tyres that are being shipped overseas every year. The legislation will implement a waste and export ban through a licensing and declaration scheme in which waste material can be prohibited from export unless specific conditions are met. These include holding an export licence or making a declaration prior to export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also sees key improvements to product stewardship that encourage businesses to take responsibility for the waste that they generate. This will be achieved through better product design and increased recovery as well as through the reuse of waste materials. This approach ensures that exported waste is safe for human health as well as for the environment. In turn, this creates jobs in the waste management and recycling sector, boosting the local and the national economies. Overall, I'm advised that our waste and recycling strategy will create 10,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The job-creating ability of recycling is immense. For every 10,000 tonnes of waste being sent to landfill around three direct jobs are created, but if we recycle that same waste we can create nine direct jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons I rise to speak in support of this legislation is that there are a number of businesses within my local community that are already helping our environment, and creating local jobs in the process. They are a fantastic demonstration of the commitment that our community has to waste-reduction and recycling, and a fantastic opportunity to demonstrate the work being done in my local community from a business perspective as well. I've been out to see a number of these local businesses. Licella and its pilot plant in Somersby have developed a catalytic hydrothermal reactor technology that can chemically recycle post-consumer products into the oil and chemicals they originally came from. This oil is a direct substitute for fossil oil and can be used to make new plastics, chemicals, fuels, waxes and bitumen products. This will reduce the amount of fossil crude that needs to be extracted. iQRenew, a partner of Licella, is a large material-recovery facility where mixed recycling comes to be sorted into various recyclable streams: plastic, paper, glass, aluminium and steel. This Somersby facility alone saves 105,000 cubic metres of landfill, which equates to 20,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases being reduced every year, the equivalent of removing over 4,500 cars from the road a year. Licella's co-founder and CEO, Dr Len Humphreys, believes that this legislation will 'provide the catalyst for us to deploy this world-leading technology in Australia, and it is a great example of Australian innovation tackling one of the world's major issues'. Dr Humphreys also said that plastic pollution is a major global issue. Research shows that almost all plastic produced still exists, most of it in landfill and our natural environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cat-HTR technology has been developed by Licella in conjunction with the University of Sydney. Licella believes that this legislation could lead to the potential to build 30 to 40 Cat-HTR plants around Australia, creating over a thousand new direct jobs. In my view, this offers great potential and some real hope for the future of our recycling and waste sectors. It really was fantastic to go out and see firsthand this business operating. It is extraordinary. The opportunities are immense, and it's fantastic to see the commitment to waste reduction and recycling being demonstrated by local businesses such as these in my electorate on the Central Coast.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Ley has said, through this bill the Morrison government is tackling a national environmental issue that has been buried in landfill or shipped offshore for far too long. These reforms are a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remodel waste management and reduce pressure on our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that many young people in my electorate of Robertson will be really pleased that this bill encourages environmental stewardship for future generations. Many students on the Central Coast have contacted me to express their passion for this issue, including 10-year-old Sofia who said, 'We need to consider the impact that plastic has on sea life and animals.' Tilly from North Avoca said that she always picks up rubbish after finishing nippers with her brother Angus because they care about keeping their beach clean. My own daughter Molly-Joy is also making sure that she has no waste in her lunch box every day before she heads off to school and recently started a petition among her friends on the importance of recycling as an important initiative to reduce the harm on our environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that when I go out and I visit local community organisations so many of them demonstrate, in many local ways in their local community, with their membership, different and important ways that they are committed to waste reduction and recycling. It definitely is something that is broadly supported across my community. Of course, everyone in our community can do their bit to assist in moving towards a greener future. The Morrison government is ensuring that we take greater responsibility for our waste whilst also helping our environment and creating jobs. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I rise to support the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills. South Australians are this country's trailblazers in recycling and we are rightfully proud of our legacy. South Australia was the first state to introduce container deposit legislation way back in 1977—first to a 5c and then to a 10c return on cans, bottles and then flavoured milk. Recycling for cash has long been part of South Australian households. Many a South Australian child has topped up their pocket money with a trip to the recycling depo. Soon, perhaps, wine bottles may be added to the list, as a result of the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority's 2019 public consultation. I know that my community would be very supportive of such a move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other states and territories have been much slower to adopt South Australia's container recycling innovations, with Tasmanians and Victorians still waiting for their own schemes to be introduced. South Australia is also proud to be the first state to phase out lightweight plastic bags. We did that more than a decade ago back in 2009. Last month legislation that prohibits the sale, supply and distribution of certain single-use plastic products passed the South Australian parliament. Fortunately, other states and territories have been quick to follow our lead—with the singular exception of New South Wales, whose government remains steadfast in its reluctance to pursue meaningful action on plastic pollution. Recycling has a long and strong history of bipartisan support in my state. I'd encourage those New South Wales members to put pressure on their state government to catch-up with the rest of the country with respect to lightweight plastic bags.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the state government announced a 2021 ban on some single-use plastic straws, stirrers and cutlery. But South Australians aren't waiting for the ban. Many communities are already leading the way, including communities in my electorate of Mayo. Last year, the District Council of Yankalilla voted to ban single-use plastics in its region. The Yankalilla district became an identified plastic-free SA precinct. I'm delighted to say that the beautiful Hills town of Uraidla has been declared South Australia's first plastic-free township. The boycott of single-use plastics was led by local residents and local businesses. The Uraidla Hotel, the Uraidla Republic Cafe and the nearby Greenhill winery all came together to be officially awarded plastic-free status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have recently spoken in the parliament about the exciting recycling hub proposed and put forward by the City of Onkaparinga, the City of Marion and City of Holdfast Bay. This is a groundbreaking project, a materials recovery facility, that is at a scale to manage the collection of recyclables from three major metropolitan councils. And it has great scope for further expansion. That is in my electorate in McLaren Vale. As one of the first facilities to be developed from scratch since the major changes in international waste commodity markets, it has been designed to produce recycled materials that meet the quality needs of Australia's and international markets. It's much more than a recycling depot. It's an engine for an exciting new circular economy in our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Brisbane, the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, has been kind enough to visit the project. I know that he and the South Australian members of parliament have been quick to realise the value of the project as well as the value of the local employment that it will provide. The recycling hub is projected to create over 80 full-time construction jobs and approximately 20 ongoing full-time jobs. The project is a prime candidate for the federal government's Recycling Modernisation Fund, which partners its funding with equal contribution from industry and state government. The South Australian government is no doubt seriously considering the proposal, and I encourage the South Australian minister for the environment to fully evaluate the project and follow through by seizing the opportunity that is offered to southern Adelaide, to the Fleurieu Peninsula and beyond. This is a really exciting collection of bills. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I'm pleased to rise today to speak in favour of this government's Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills. I do so knowing the people in my electorate of Curtin care deeply about recycling. They want to be confident that, when they put things in a recycling bin or deliver them to a collection centre, they will be repurposed effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all aware there have been shameful cases where—when we thought we were doing the right thing, putting our rubbish into different waste bins or taking them to certain drop-off points—we've found out later that they've been dumped in landfill or sent overseas for somebody else to manage. This has to stop. Likewise we need to stop throwing away millions of tonnes of waste. We need to take our own steps to make sure we are aware of what we are using and what we are wasting, and we need to support the schemes and initiatives that reduce our usage of products which can't be effectively repurposed or recycled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are going to establish a legislative framework to reduce the environmental and human health impacts of products and reduce waste from products and waste material through two key measures. The first of these implements the decision in March 2020—the decision of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to ban the export of waste glass, plastic, paper and tyres. The second replaces and improves the existing Product Stewardship Act to ensure that those who design, manufacture and distribute products take greater responsibility for the impacts of those products on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first element, the banning of the export of waste, is rolling the ban out over a period of time. Mixed plastics are going to be banned from 1 July 2021. Whole used tyres will be banned from 1 December 2021. Single resin or polymer plastics will be banned from 2022, and mixed and unsorted paper and cardboard will be banned from 1 July 2024. The bill is going to implement the waste export ban through a licensing and declaration scheme, which will ensure that waste material is value-added and safe for human health and the environment in the receiving countries. It maximises the ability of our waste management and recycling sector to recover and re-manufacture waste materials, creating jobs here in Australia. There are going to be criminal offences and civil liability penalties for people who contravene the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of these bills is focused on product stewardship, which is aimed at assisting all of us to reduce our waste by getting our manufacturers and our industry to embrace the circular economy principles and to lead the charge on proper product stewardship. Product stewardship, in simple terms, requires manufacturers and industry to consider the entire life cycle of a product—not just to think about it ending at the point of sale but to think about what happens to it after it is sold. The principle of a circular economy is one where we can trust that the products we use today can, at the end of their life, value-add to the products we will buy tomorrow, so that when we buy these products in the future we won't be creating additional drain on our natural resources and we won't be adding to the mountains of waste in landfills, oceans and native environments. This part of the bills takes on board many of the recommendations that were contained in the review of the Product Stewardship Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills provide a framework for three kinds of product stewardship scheme: voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory. A voluntary product stewardship scheme drives action to reduce the negative impact on the environment of waste from products and materials—so it's a voluntary one that people within a sector can sign up to. Co-regulatory product stewardship schemes are a combination of industry action and government regulation. Government sets the minimum standards, or the minimum outcomes and operational requirements, while industry has some discretion about how those requirements and outcomes are to be achieved. The final layer—the most onerous, if you like—is the mandatory product stewardship scheme, which can require a person, such as a manufacturer, importer or distributor of a product, to take specific actions in relation to a product. Mandatory requirements may be imposed where there's a high level of environmental or human health risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills are going to strengthen the minister's priority list, adding clear time frames and recommended actions to increase transparency around listed products. Again, there are going to be new offences and civil penalty provisions related to product stewardship, which will strengthen efforts to manage the impacts of different products and materials on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is only one part of a whole lot of new measures that this government is taking to transform our recycling industry and help transition Australia to a truly circular economy. The government has made targeted investments to build a stronger Australian recycling industry and create more jobs. There are the Recycling Modernisation Fund and the National Product Stewardship Investment Fund. There's money that has been invested to implement the Commonwealth's commitments under our National Waste Policy Action Plan. Money is being invested to improve national waste data collection. Money is being invested for a special round of co-op research centre projects to focus on recycling. The government is also strengthening Commonwealth procurement guidelines so that any Commonwealth agency undertaking procurement considers environmental sustainability and the use of recycled content when determining value for money. By using our own purchasing power, we can generate demand and encourage innovation. We're also, properly, working with the states and territories to develop national standards and specifications for the use of recycled content in a broad range of capital works projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the people of Curtin are deeply passionate about recycling. There are numerous volunteer organisations working at a grassroots level on initiatives focused on ensuring our natural environment is preserved, enhanced and, where necessary, restored for the benefit of us and for the benefit of future generations. I refer to the many 'friends of' groups, such as Friends of Shenton Bushland and Friends of Lake Claremont, and the coast care groups: Cottesloe Coastcare Association, Cambridge Coastcare. These are all run by volunteers. Not only do they run the organisation; they do volunteer weeding and volunteer management of lots of beautiful environmental areas in my electorate. This work is absolutely critical. What they often report is that the amount of plastics they find in this beautiful, pristine environment is absolutely huge—monumental. They take steps to bring the community along with them to help get rid of this rubbish, this waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also say that most, if not all, of the schools in my electorate have their own dedicated recycling and waste management programs. Some of the schools—at last count it was over 62 but I imagine the number's much higher now—work with Greenbatch, which is a local organisation that looks at waste as a valuable resource. It's building WA's first plastics reprocessing plant to reduce the amount of plastic that is being sent to landfill. Greenbatch partners with schools around WA to collect plastics for the future plant. Currently, they are turning plastics into 3D printing filament, which they then give back to the schools for their use. So that really is the circular economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other schools have developed their own initiatives. One is the Moerlina School in Claremont, which was recently successful in being awarded a $15,000 communities environment grant to create a child driven community partnership to utilise rubbish as a resource, focusing on the collection and repurposing of plastic waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Perth talking before about local councils. I think he mentioned one in my electorate, but he may not be aware—and I have to give a big sing-out to the local councils in my electorate because of this—that five of them have come together, worked together with regard to waste and set up the Western Metropolitan Regional Council. This actually looks after the waste of five local councils, and another one is now joining. The west metro regional council doesn't just offer a service to collect and dispose of recyclable material for people, though they do that and do it brilliantly; they collect absolutely everything: fridges, tyres, cartridges—absolutely everything. They also undertake a significant community education role. So they work with schools, but they also work with the public at large, holding sessions where they teach people about working out what plastic is what, because there are different types of plastics. They want to do more, so they're actually excited about the opportunity to get additional funding to invest more in the recycling space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to recycling, we even have a local organisation that recycles stationery. I've spoken in this House before about this organisation. It's called Give Write and it was set up by Anita Bell; her husband, Jeff; and her son, Ben. Ben, you're about to start your exams in WA, so best of luck. They've had a pretty troubling time this year with Anita being ill. They set up this organisation about 18 months ago now. They collect an extraordinary amount of leftover stationery. At the end of the school year, as any parent would know, your kids come home and a lot of stuff you bought for them at the beginning of the year hasn't actually been touched. Maybe it's just my kids! Give Write collects all this. It gets all the schools. I now have a Give Write bin in my office for people to drop off their unused stationery. It gets collected, and then Give Write uses volunteers to repackage all of this and send it to kids in schools who don't actually have the resources to buy all the stationery they need. So it's recycling pencils, pens, notebooks, notebooks—anything you can imagine. They clean it, they make sure it works and then they put it in packages. Again, that is an example of recycling that is being embraced within my community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of concluding, I would say that these bills help us. We've got a commitment to recycling. We have a commitment to managing our waste. These bills will help us all take that step further and a long way down the path, because these bills regulate. They expand the capacity of industry. It's also about investing in new technology and expanding the markets for recycling and for recycled products. These reforms are really important for our country both here and now and for future generations, and I'm very happy to commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills. I am actually quite pleased to have a chance to stand in this House and talk about waste and recycling, because I actually have a great passion for this, as many people in my community know. For me, the thing that we are wasting at the moment is the opportunity that is in waste. The whole world at the moment is trying to transition from a society that uses more stuff than it needs, that uses once and throws away, that makes plastic that lasts forever and then uses it once. We're all trying to transition, and the technology that's being developed around the world is happening quite rapidly, but in Australia we've had the pause button pushed on this for seven years now. So I just want to talk a little bit about where we are at the moment—the basic details of where we are when it comes to waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, there are a bit more than 2½ tonnes of waste produced for every one of us every year. That includes about 100 kilograms of plastic, and we recycle or reprocess barely 10 per cent of that. We drill for oil, we make plastic and then we bury it in the dirt. Eighty per cent goes into landfill, where it, of course, lasts forever. We use it once and we bury it forever, because it's not biodegradable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2017-18 Australian plastics recycling survey, we only managed to recycle 9.4 per cent of the 3.4 million tonnes of plastic consumed in Australia. That's worse than in any other year since 2014-15. So we're going backwards, not forwards. The report, which was commissioned over the summer, on the recycling market found that our plastics recycling capability is lower now than it was in 2005. There is three million tonnes of plastic that we don't recycle, and the best we can hope for is that it goes into landfill rather than into our oceans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an appalling situation for a developed economy that has the capacity to solve these problems right now—and we have had that capacity for quite some time. Australia was late to the party anyway. Everybody in the community has known for a long time that we need to do better with what we are doing. Labor started the process back in 2009 by creating a national waste policy, establishing a national waste reporting process and introducing the Product Stewardship Act 2011—an incredibly important act at the time, which dealt with the requirement that companies manage the entire life cycle of the products they make. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme was started, but that was the only one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was in 2011. Nearly 10 years later, we have had seven years of a conservative Liberal government and we haven't had one more item added to that. Nothing has happened since that stewardship plan was started. In fact, there were two voluntary programs and one of them has disappeared. So we've actually gone backwards since 2011. This is in absolute contrast to the attitudes of the community. My community are years ahead of this government in their desire to recycle and their willingness to do something about it. There are 35,000 people in the Facebook 'buy, swap and sell' group in Parramatta and another 13,000 just over the highway in Granville. There are thousands and thousands of people who know they have to do better and are trying to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of us are still concentrating on plastics and the stuff we put through our recycling bins. But if we had been doing what we should have been doing for the last 20 years, let alone the last seven, we would now be talking about clothing, over 95 per cent of which ends up in landfill. It takes hundreds of litres of water to make one cotton T-shirt, and we wear it for six months and throw it into landfill. It's an extraordinary waste. Yet the technology to recycle cotton now exists. About three years ago, two companies in the US worked out how to do it. The technology exists to take that incredibly valuable and unique product and use it over and over again. It costs so much in resources to make, but what a great product it is—but not if you only use it once.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we are not talking about water recycling. We have single-use water in our cities. We use drinking water once. It's absolutely bizarre. We should be talking about waste when it comes to that. We should be talking about waste when it comes to compost. My community is really keen to start serious community composting, but where is the support from the government for that? We know that 60 per cent of landfill is compostable, yet it is still in landfill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At great risk to myself, I would also like to mention phosphorus. The world is running out of phosphorus. We actually get it from bird urine; we call it bird poo but it is actually bird urine. It is really high in phosphorus. We've been digging it up and using it for fertiliser for years, and the world is running out. In Western Sydney we have one of the largest mineable sources of phosphorus in Australia. It is actually in our urine—and we flush it down the toilet. It's incredibly easy to process; it's not dirty. Yet we mix it with stuff that is hard to process, faeces, and we shove it down the loo and flush it to heaven knows where. It is kind of funny that we do that. In other parts of the world, people are starting to look at the technology to recapture that. Phosphorus is rare and extremely valuable, and we just throw it away without thought—because we can. Most of the things I'm talking about are things we do because we can. We thought we could keep going, but we now know that we can't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community, there are a number of people who are really starting to work hard on this, and some of them have been there for a long time. I particularly want to mention the Bower. The Bower's been around, in one form or another, for years and years. It's been in Parramatta for a short period of time. They launched a right-to-repair campaign recently, asking that manufacturers produce goods that are fixable—ensuring spare parts are easily available and ensuring Australians can make reasonable attempts to repair goods without risk of voiding their warranty. A right to repair would also encourage manufacturers to make high-quality, long-lasting goods in the first place, rather than products that conveniently die as soon as the warranty expires. They launched a petition calling on the government to act as we move towards a circular economy. This is incredibly important work. If you are in the community of Parramatta, or anywhere in Western Sydney, and you want to be better at repairing stuff, they run fantastic workshops as well. They are a really interesting organisation, and they are doing what they need to do to make this world a better place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bower and the Generous and the Grateful, another organisation, collect furniture which can be reused and recycled. It is really amazing work. They have so many donations now that they can't find enough places to put them. So they're now trying to develop their market. Incidentally, when they first tried to apply for the environment grants program that each electorate was given, their application was rejected on the grounds that finding a market for recyclable goods wasn't eligible, and we had to fight really hard to get it included. If you're so far ahead, as an organisation that's been around for 20 years or more, and you can collect so much material you have to look at the demand side, that's where the money should go. Otherwise, they collect it and it goes back into landfill. It is an extraordinary organisation doing truly, truly amazing things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to the product stewardship issue. Again, this is incredibly important. There are some recyclers in Australia at the moment. One is called Soft Landing, which recycles hundreds of thousands of mattresses. They have very good relationships with the large mattress manufacturers. That is one area where product stewardship really should have been in place for quite some time, because the major manufacturers have already been working with the recyclers to move down that path. There's very low-hanging fruit that has sat there, hanging off the trees, for many, many years. We're a little concerned about the product stewardship review and that the changes to product stewardship that are made in this bill are not strong enough. They leave far too much to industries and manufacturers to work out themselves. We've seen with that 'let them sort it out themselves' approach over the last seven years that not much happens. There are free-rider problems that this bill doesn't solve as well. So we're a little concerned that this doesn't go far enough. As late as it is, we would have expected more on the table at the moment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also has to lift its game when it comes to recycling labels. The results of an independent audit recently showed that, when it comes to lifting our woeful waste and recycling performance, the labelling regime is falling a long way short, not just for recyclers but for people who want to recycle that bit of plastic or cardboard or whatever it is that's in their hands. The audit was commissioned by the Australian Council of Recycling, and the report found 88 per cent of product packaging could be recycled—88 per cent is getting up there—but only 40 per cent featured a recycling label, and some of the labels were wrong or misleading. So 88 per cent might have been recyclable, but a high percentage didn't have appropriate labels. Even more concerning is that only 28 per cent of Australian products used the Australasian Recycling Label, an initiative launched and paid for in part by the Morrison government. But it is not being applied or used in the way that it should be. Again, there was a nice announcement but not very good follow-through. The report found a:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lack of any disposal labelling, as seen on 51% of products, may also lead to consumers wrongfully placing non-recyclable items into their kerbside recycling bin …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that when you do that you contaminate a whole truckload of recycling materials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also, of course, need to seriously look at recycling within Australia. It's been few years now since China gave the warning that it would stop accepting our less than adequate recyclable material. Because it wasn't sorted, it was contaminated; it just wasn't useable. We take material that comes separately out of households and stick it all together, and, in doing so, make it more expensive and more difficult to work with. It's been years since that was announced, and we are still nowhere near it. The Morrison government commissioned an independent analysis that showed that Australia may require a 400 per cent increase in recycling infrastructure capacity to cope with the additional waste from the export ban, and that is within just a couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of people in my community, as I said before, who really, really want to do more on this. I am going to suggest to them and to this House that we as a community really need to start the change ourselves. This government is not going to do it at the speed in which the community wishes. We have an opportunity in the Parramatta area in the next couple of years. The major recycling contract expires in two years, which means we have an opportunity to move from a situation where we are simply freighting rubbish to a location to a situation in which we can have a number of businesses work locally to genuinely produce recyclable and reusable materials. There will be extraordinary opportunities in the next two years if we work together. I suggest to anybody in my electorate who really wants to get together, have look at what is going on, find others that care about this, identify other community composting programs—if that's what you're interested in—and have a look at what local businesses are around that can help the community do what it wishes to do to go onto my website and click on 'local solutions' and sign up. We will get together later in the year. We will start seriously talking through what we can do about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunities in this are amazing. The opportunities in genuine recycling and a genuine circular economy are quite extraordinary. People in my community went to a circular economy forum in numbers about seven years ago. They've been ready for a long time. So let's get together and see what we can do. We can't really wait. No matter what the government does, we still need to change our behaviours and cultural approach to waste in our communities as well. So let's get together and see what we can do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  Deputy Speaker Wallace, it's good to see you in the chair. You're looking very fine in your stewardship over this chamber today. In fact, that's what this legislation is about. It's about stewardship. Of course, I welcome it because I'm a Liberal. One of the reasons that Liberals welcome principles of stewardship is that we understand the responsibility that one generation has to the next, to hand to future generations an economy that is as prosperous if not better than the one we inherited. It's the same with the sense of a united society. That's one of the reasons why we oppose divisive identity politics that seek to divide people and pursue an agenda where people see their differences rather than their points of commonality and common humanity. And, of course, we want to steward the environment for future generations so that they can enjoy the benefits that it provides, the natural beauty with which we are blessed and the resources that it provides for economic opportunity and also the opportunity through technological advancement and economic progress to undo some of the damages of the past. That's ultimately what this legislation is about. What can we as responsible Liberal stewards do to improve the health and welfare of our great nation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the assistant minister on this important legislation, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 package. When I think about the outstanding ministers of the Morrison government and those who've come in full thrust and grabbed the issues head-on and made sure they have progressed reform in a constructive way that improves the health and welfare of our country, I often think of the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, the member for Brisbane, who is doing an outstanding job in bringing together this package of legislation and passing it through the parliament, not just because of the substance of the legislation—although that is obviously critical—but because he is building on the good work of the Morrison government and the coalition governments to date and bringing along industry so that we're all part of the solution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that always bothers me about our political opponents is that they always seek to divide this country. They always seek to divide between haves and have-nots and young and old, and, when it comes to industry, it's always about what punitive measures they can put on them, rather than working with them to be part of the solution and move our great country forward together. The legislation the assistant minister has put before us is focused on bringing everybody forward together and recognising the contribution that industry can make by being part of a sustainable solution. That's critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all concerned about recycling and waste reduction in this country. We're all mindful, on a day-to-day basis, of what we can do and how, as responsible stewards of the environment, we can reduce our environmental footprint. In fact, for many of us, it goes to the foundation of why we're Liberals. One of the reasons we believe in free markets is that they price out the cost of waste. If you ever want to see environmental degradation and wreckage and a complete disregard for the natural environment and the efficient use of the world's scarce resources, you just need to go and look at economic systems, like socialism, which have no interest in environmental stewardship, because they're rapaciously attacking the environment to try and meet the needs of people today. Liberals see opportunity from waste. They see the opportunity of how it can be harvested and returned to economic benefit and how it can then be used not just to reduce our environmental footprint but to grow the economic pie and improve the welfare of everybody. That goes to the heart of what is included in this legislation, particularly the principle of a circular economy. We can reduce our environmental footprint by reusing precious minerals, metals and products that may have a second life if we can find a way to repurpose the goods for a greater benefit. This is what our constituents and the people of Australia want to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I see all the time is people asking us what we're doing for the environment. Of course, we're doing many things for the environment—unlike our political opponents, who always want to put the date out further. If you look at their attitude towards climate change, they don't want a target for today or even for a decade's time; they always want to put it further out so that they can't be held accountable, because the positions they take aren't based on practical outcomes but on rhetoric, vanity and virtue signalling. This government is not just addressing climate change by setting targets for today, targets for 10 years from now and, ultimately, targets for the future so that we can measure them against benchmarks and outcomes; we're also looking at what we can practically do today to improve the lives of Australians. This has been the core of the focus—particularly for the Prime Minister, who has a particular interest in preventing environmental degradation and stopping the amount of plastics that go into our oceans. You can talk about things in the ethereal, but we're talking about and doing things in the practical, in the here and now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills is focused precisely on that. It recognises that we have to limit the amount of waste we produce, that we have to find pathways for recycling and recycling investment in Australia today and that we need to provide the pathways for every Australian, every citizen, to be responsible. That goes back to the heart of the Liberal ideal. We don't want a country run by 600,000 Canberra bureaucrats down; we want a nation built from the foundation of the citizen up, where they have the freedom to take responsibility, where we call them to their sense of responsibility in the best interests of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and the Environment, the member for Brisbane, came to the Goldstein electorate late last year, we went to look at the practical steps that the Goldstein community is taking, particularly in the City of Bayside and the City of Glen Eira. They're not just looking at what we can do to reduce people's environmental footprint, which is critically important, like separating out green waste and putting out recycling to make sure it can be repurposed and reused; they're also increasingly looking towards using food waste to generate energy, as a new energy source, and pathways for collecting compost, to reduce the overall environmental footprint of food waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At every point we're looking at what we can practically do and what we can empower citizens and communities to do, not to push discussions off into the distant future, like our political opponents, who seem to believe in the rhetoric of the environment but not in the practice. That's the approach we'll continue to take, because it's practical, it's focused and it's outcomes driven. This allows us to build a sense of confidence amongst the Australian people but also build up the economic opportunities and the industries that can thrive in an environment where we take stewardship and responsibility seriously. I know there are lots of businesses, in Victoria and across Australia, who see this economic opportunity to reduce our environmental footprint and repurpose our waste. We want to encourage them to provide pathways to purpose and growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also what I hear from schools when I go and talk to young minds who are interested in the future of the planet they're living on. They do want the big discussions around the global challenges we face, but they also want to know what they can do to help—what can they do on a day-to-day basis and what they can take to their parents and other family members to improve the community they live in now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the basis of the approach that our government is taking, and we welcome it, and this parliament should welcome it because it's the basis on which we can have a sustainable environmental strategy for the future. Working with industry with practical time frames and making sure there's voluntary participation, we can improve the basis of our industry—and of course, where necessary, have punitive measures for those who have done wrong. If we take that approach, we will build the economy we need for the 21st century, because we all know that the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 recession have exposed some of the weaknesses of the 21st century economy. What this government is doing under the leadership of the Prime Minister and under the leadership of the minister for energy in the work that he's doing, and of course with the Minister for the Environment and the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, is building the economy for the 21st century: prosperity, responsibility and opportunity for every Australian.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I rise to speak on the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills. The amount of plastic that is infecting our environment is, quite simply, frightening. I had the great fortune to work with a local group of volunteers in my electorate called Protect Our 1. It's a group that was established by a young Indigenous man and asks people to volunteer to clean up the beaches along the east coast of Sydney. Protect Our 1 have been very successful in getting a lot of people to come along on a weekend and pick up rubbish and, in particular, plastics from our beaches. I've done several of those beach clean-ups now with Protect Our 1, and the amount of plastic that is collected during these clean-ups is frightening. On a number of occasions, they've used AUSMAP—the organisation that is devoted to reducing the amount of plastic in our waterways—to do collections of microplastics over a very small space of beach. Typically, it's one square metre of beach. The amount of microplastics that they get from one square metre of beach is simply unbelievable—on average, about 4,000 pieces of microplastic per square metre of beach in Sydney. When you look at the number of beaches throughout Australia, that is a very frightening statistic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO estimate that there are 14 million tonnes of plastic on the ocean floor, and it's much greater and much worse than they ever expected. Our ocean is literally drowning in plastic. The damage that this can cause to marine life is of course significant. They can often mistake it for food, and it destroys the natural environment and their natural habitats. But it can also harm our health because, if a fish swallows microplastic, guess where it ends up when we eat it? It ends up in our system, and that can't be good for our health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only members of the community but also us in particular as legislators have got an obligation to try to reduce the amount of reusable waste, particularly plastic, that we have in our community and to ensure that more of it is recycled in Australia. And we've got to find a way to coerce the corporations that are producing these recyclable materials to take responsibility for the plastic in their products and recycle a lot more of it. In Australia, not enough of that is happening at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians probably don't know what happens to plastics and other recyclables once they put them in their bins at home. We've been successful in Australia in changing the culture around domestic recycling. Most local government areas will now have a separate recycling bin. In the area that I live in, it's the yellow bins, and we've been successful in encouraging people to separate their household waste and put their paper, cardboard, plastics and other recyclables into those yellow bins. I think I'd be on fair ground in saying that, when most Australians do this, they probably feel good; they probably feel like they're doing something to reduce the amount of waste, particularly into landfill, and to ensure that we're protecting the environment. But what they wouldn't know is that, unfortunately, quite a significant amount of what goes into the separate yellow bins ends up in landfill and can end up in our oceans and our waterways. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up until last year, what occurred with most of that recyclable material, particularly the plastics, is that it was exported to other countries. In 2018-19, Australia exported 4½ million tonnes of recyclables to other nations, up from three million tonnes in 2006-07, so you can see how significant the growth had been. There is no doubt that, unfortunately, some of that ended up in landfill. We've simply been exporting our problem to other nations, and some of those are developing nations that don't have the environmental protections that Australia has, and that material would have no doubt ended up in waterways and in landfill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A shift occurred in 2018 when the Chinese government decided that they were no longer going to accept imported recyclables from other nations. What followed then was similar announcements by other nations that were importing recyclable materials, and they included India, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. So, if this recyclable material is not being exported by Australia at the moment, where it is going? Most Australians are unclear on that—in fact, most of us are unclear on that—because the answer isn't simple at all. Some of it is still being exported to nations like Indonesia, which still accepts some of our recyclable materials. A small proportion of it is recycled, but unfortunately the larger proportion of it simply goes into landfill. I think it's really misleading the Australian public about all of this cultural change that they've been through in recent decades to try and change the view of how we treat waste in Australia when it simply still goes into landfill. Australians are being vigilant—they're doing the right thing—but at our level we're being lazy and we haven't put in place the practices and regulation that are required to ensure that more of this material is recycled in the future. I was horrified when I recently spoke to a local government representative in the community that I represent and asked him where the recyclable material in our yellow waste bins was going, and his response was, 'Most it's going into landfill.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, in March this year, COAG agreed to ban the export of waste materials—plastic, glass, tyres and paper. That export ban from Australia begins on 1 January next year, with glass, and works through to all of those materials being banned for export by 2024. So we need to develop our own domestic recycling capacity. We need to make sure that we as legislators are doing the right thing by the Australian public, who expect us to put in place the measures to produce better outcomes and ensure that more of this material is recycled. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a step in the right direction. There is no doubt about that. That's why Labor is supporting it. But it doesn't go far enough. There's much more that we could be doing to ensure that more of this material is recycled. This legislation will establish a new licensing and declaration scheme with standard qualifying requirements, and fees and charges to cover administrative costs, conditions, reporting and auditing arrangements, and processes for seeking exemptions to the licensing requirements. The bills also replace the existing product stewardship laws, making some long overdue changes to the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme and enabling the minister to make recommendations to indicate time frames by which industry should achieve better outcomes in taking responsibility for the life cycle of their products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On product stewardship, I don't believe that industry and government are doing enough to encourage more responsibility by corporations for, in particular, the plastics they produce with their products. Manufacturers need to bear that responsibility for the life cycle of the goods they are producing and that are consumed by Australians. This is an area where the government has failed. The product stewardship scheme was initially established by the Gillard government. It has different elements to it: there is a voluntary capacity, there is a co-regulatory capacity and there is a mandatory capacity. When you look at the outcomes, it has been a dismal failure under this government. There is only one party operating in the co-regulatory scheme. And guess how many are operating in the mandatory scheme? None. No organisations are operating under the mandatory scheme. And this government has not listed any items to include in that scheme. So there is a huge free-rider problem with this scheme. Other corporations are saying, 'If it's not mandatory, why would I? There are additional costs associated with it. Why would I participate?' And guess what? They're not. So all this plastic—in particular, water bottles—is ending up in our oceans, in our waterways, and too much of it is ending up in landfill. So I believe the government has a responsibility to put in place measures to change that and ensure that more of this material ends up being recycled. That is simply not happening at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame that it took a ban on waste imports by China and several other nations for the government to finally do something. That has resulted in this legislation. The Australian community and our waste and resource management sector are crying out for national leadership on reforms that not only reduce landfill and plastics pollution but actually build the foundation of a sustainable and circular economy in which materials are recycled and reused, and waste is reduced to a bare minimum. Up to eight million tonnes of plastic makes its way into the oceans each year and global consumption of plastic could triple by 2040. Our nation only recycles 12 per cent of plastics and 58 per cent of waste in total. Some analyses indicate that Australia will need to increase local plastics reprocessing capacity by 400 per cent in order to be effective in recycling this waste that we have now stopped exporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very poor record on plastics in particular, yet Australia stands heavily affected by plastics pollution. In order to improve our poor rate of recycling when it comes to environmentally harmful materials like plastics, it's vital that we dramatically improve our local processing and manufacturing markets. But that will only be viable if there are end markets for this material, if there are end markets for the recycled product. In addition to supportive procurement policy, there needs to be better and greater producer responsibility when it comes to product design and the incorporation of recycled content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what we've got from this government are recycled policies and recycled announcements. In July, the Minister for the Environment announced the $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund. That was then renounced in the budget. Last year's $100 million Recycling Investment Fund has not advanced one single dollar, and last year's $20 million Product Stewardship Investment Fund has not made a single grant. And that's the point: we are facing this problem of not being able to export our recyclables—which I think is a good thing; we shouldn't be forcing our problems onto other nations—but we haven't put in place the measures to deal with it domestically. The evidence of that is in the establishment of these funds by this government and not one dollar invested in the Product Stewardship Investment Fund through a single grant. That is a failure. That is a failure from this government that we are all paying the cost of and our environment in particular is paying the cost of. We need to do more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by congratulating some of the local government areas that exist in my community for some of the actions that they're taking. I think it's great to see, although we've had this lack of leadership from the Morrison government on this issue, that local government and state governments are taking the lead in the absence of that leadership. Randwick council recently introduced a new food and organic waste system whereby in future food and organics will be able to be placed in a separate bin at Randwick City Council and that material will then go into composting. It will ensure it has avoided going into landfill. It's estimated that 50 per cent of landfill is made up of food and organic waste material that produces methane. We can do it if we put in place the right measures. I want to congratulate Randwick council because they're showing leadership in the absence of this government showing leadership. These bills are a step in the right direction but they don't go far enough. We really need more responsibility around product stewardship and we need this government to take leadership on recycling.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I rise in support of the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020, the associated bills and consequential and transitional provisions. Most Australians know the status quo. It's a quick and easy process. You put stuff in the bin when you're finished. If you are a conscientious citizen of Australia you separate it into the red bin, the green bin, the yellow bin. Then that's about the last thing that you think about. But we do have a massive problem in this country. We have huge amounts of waste that historically we have shipped interstate, shipped into landfill or shipped overseas. It's really good that we are now looking after our own waste—cleaning up our own mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will put effect to that by announcing, in a sequential fashion, the cessation of unprocessed waste being exported overseas. I think it shows that our nation has grown up. Everyone's aware of the recycling of plastics and other sorts of waste that end up in our waterways, or end up in the oceans of the world, or end up in giant eddies in the Northern Hemisphere or down the throat of sea life, even leading to death or drowning of birds, seals, fish—you name it. The small particles of the plastic can end up in living animals. It is a game changer that we have got this sequential legislative ban on exporting unprocessed waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will put effect to our National Waste Policy Action Plan, of which there are seven main streams. As I mentioned unprocessed plastic waste, paper, glass and tyres will not be able to be exported anymore. We have a goal of reducing waste by 10 per cent for every Australian by 2030. Each of us produce, by all the things that are provided for us, 2.7 tonnes of waste each a year, so that means reducing our own personal waste by 300 kilos per year. If you think how much you put in your bin that is a lot of waste, but there's all this indirect waste that you don't see which is produced to deliver all the other things that we have in our modern life. Even though families and individuals have been recycling and using reusable bags at the supermarket, this goes beyond to governments, to institutions, to states, to local councils and so on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are aiming, on the third action item, to recover 80 per cent of the average waste that normally goes off into other streams. We're aiming to increase the use of recycled content by government and industry, not just by individuals. And we are also aiming to phase out problematic, unnecessary plastics by 2025—only 16 per cent of our plastic waste is recycled or reused. We also want to reduce organic waste that's going into landfill. The practical things we can do are: composting on site in your own home or in your own back garden; having a worm farm; and having stuff go into the green recycling bin so it can be turned into compost on an industrial scale. This legislation is aimed at the bigger fish in the pond—the macro waste, not just individual household waste. We also need to have accurate data and reporting on how we're going on reducing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will turbocharge the process of product stewardship, which was initiated back in 2011 when we weren't in government. The ALP was on the government benches then. Product stewardship has taken root in lots of businesses, but this legislation will turbocharge that effort. Good design, where products are designed so they can be used again, is the aim of product stewardship. Taking responsibility for what you've designed is a really good initiative. Many of us remember when we used to get our milk in bottles—the milko used to drop it off at your front door step—and that bottle was used time and time and time again. Glass is very reusable. Even if it's broken it can be resmelted and reused. Everyone's familiar with the recycling of aluminium cans initiative, at least in the state of New South Wales. It was quite disruptive when it first came out, but now that it's up and running it's a really good initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people see this ban as being just another bit of government intervention, but, really, it's long overdue. Waste shouldn't be looked at as a problem. Waste is a resource, and if you recycle intelligently you can turn that waste resource into a commodity, something that's valuable that you can sell. If you design it well, you can use it multiple times. In fact, things can be designed to be reused and recycled. Multi-use food containers: everyone used to have glass for jams, preserves and things like that. It's just that the quick and easy bit is just putting it into another piece of paper. That leads to another problem—our paper and cardboard waste. That is recyclable, very much recyclable, if you get it into a recycling system. It can be repurposed and come back as cardboard. If you really want to get serious you can turn it back into fresh paper. All these things are ultimately recyclable. It's just that we've got to have a system so that it can happen on a macro scale. Look at tyres. Tyres are energy rich. Not only are there the plastics and carbon residue of the actual tyre bit but there are precious metals in the wire and the reinforcing, and, through the wonders of technology, all those end-of-life plastics can be used through pyrolysis and turned into road-ready diesel and petrol. There are systems that are being developed in Australia that give incredibly high returns. Up to 85 per cent of the energy can be turned into diesel, petrol, marine diesel and even avgas, and, depending on which pyrolytic process you use, you can also turn it into liquefied petroleum gases. So they are very recyclable. It is a huge resource that we should be tapping into, because otherwise we've got to drill for more oil somewhere else. It might seem like it's difficult, but if the price of oil goes up all these recycled fuels will become very, very cost competitive. This Australian process, which is now being developed to be put into place in Thailand, in Amsterdam, in Northampton in England and potentially in the US, will deliver fuels that meet Euro 6 standards. So it is very effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are other resources, like batteries. Everyone talks about renewable energy, but the thing with renewable energy is it has to be renewed the whole time. Solar panels only have a 20- to 25-year life. So we are going to have to have a recycling plan for them, because there is a lot of energy embedded in a solar panel. You have to be using your solar panel for four years to make up for the carbon footprint of the manufacturing of a standard solar panel. So if you then throw it on a garbage tip or bury it you're just going to have to create another carbon footprint to make another panel. So we have to start planning now to recycle all these millions and millions of solar panels that are being produced around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone is turning to batteries. Batteries, as we know, are not a source of energy; they are a source of storage for energy that's produced by something else. They have a huge carbon footprint too. In fact, when the Prius first came out they estimated that you had to run that Prius for 11 years to make up for all the copper, all the wiring, the second motor and the battery itself. So if you are just going to use a battery in a Prius and then chuck it on a heap you will have all these toxic battery metals and elements rotting away. You could be turning it into a recycled battery. Landfill with plastic, steel and all these potentially recyclable metals like copper and rare earth metals should be an absolute no-no. Our oceans and waterways shouldn't be filling up with plastic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we do our bit in Australia and set an example for other nations, it will be a really good thing for the planet. We are, compared to some other nations, quite behind on how much we recycle. Rubbish can be turned into jobs. It can be turned into money. Like I said, if we are smart about the way we manage our waste, not only will it lead to a cleaner local environment and a cleaner global environment but in Australia we will have much more employment and economic activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exciting thing about these waste systems is they can be done in regional areas and they can be done in metro areas. In fact, I might just say a few words about pyrolysis. Pyrolysis among some quarters of the Australian body politic is seen as an evil process because you are burning stuff. But there is actually no oxygen. You are heating stuff and you are recycling it and turning it into liquid fuels, liquefied petroleum gases or biochar, which is great for increasing soil carbon. All sorts of things come out of it. It is a wonderful technology, yet we have been very slow on the uptake. Everyone has been used to just putting things in an incinerator. But a pyrolytic plant is not an incinerator. Sure, there's heat and melting, but people have to realise, as I said, either we have to keep drilling for oil everywhere or we get sensible about using the resources we have now. It will be a lot easier to utilise all those tyres and bits of rubber and plastics that go into cars and all sorts of things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People talk about carbon sinks. When you are changing hydrocarbon to another shape or form, that is recycling. Some of these long-lived plastics are a store of carbon. Some plastics, depending on the type, can last for hundreds of years. That is a carbon sink in itself. So that's why I think there needs to be a step-change in the way people are thinking about burning stuff. In the old days Australian councils used to have incinerators. Hospitals used to have incinerators. You just chucked everything in the back and you didn't think about it. That was incredibly wasteful, because you had all that energy. At least you should have used it to heat your water for industrial purposes or to heat your building—but, no, we just used to chuck everything in. The pyrolytic techniques are really advanced around the world, but, now that we have this legislation coming through, these sorts of things will, by their very requirement to meet the legislation, turn the economy and turn entrepreneurs to using this sort of technology in Australia, and it will be great for the economy. Some people think that, if it's plastic, you've just got to shred it up into little bits and pieces and put it in a playground as a soft landing spot or put it into a road, but I think we can be much smarter and get much better energy outcomes out of this resource rather than just having it sit inert and rotting over 30 or 50 years or whatever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, this legislation turns to unprocessed plastic, glass, tyres and paper but there are so many other things that we need to turn our minds and our economy to. I mentioned batteries and solar panels, which are top of the pops because there's a lot of energy involved in making them. If you just put them into a landfill, you've wasted that energy. We should be reusing it. Rather than starting another mine somewhere, reuse all the copper, let alone all the iron waste that's sitting around the country. There must be millions of tonnes of old iron, steel and aluminium that can be recycled. We've just got to get a big enough scale to make it pay and make it work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills have a lot of other technical provisions preventing and fining people and prosecuting people if they are sending off unprocessed waste. It's a great initiative. We have got a significant allocation in the budget for recycling modernisation: $190 million. We've got $20 million for the national product stewardship scheme that I mentioned, $35 million to implement our National Waste Policy Action Plan that I started talking about and also our waste data; it's going to require a whole system, and there's an appropriation of $24.6 million for that. And this is also for co-operative research centres. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  On the most recent figures I have been able to find, Australia generated some 67 million tonnes of waste. That was in 2016-17, so I suspect that perhaps, when those figures are updated, the figure might even be higher than that. But 67 million tonnes of waste was generated, of which 54 million was referred to as 'core waste'. That is waste dealt with by the waste and resource recovery industry across the country. About a third of the waste comes from construction and demolition services, a third is from commercial and industrial sectors and the rest, I suspect, is mainly household waste that's accumulated across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By comparison with other developed countries, Australia generates more waste per capita but recycles less. We have about 6.7 million tonnes of inorganic waste collected every year and, sadly, about 130,000 tonnes of plastic ends up in waterways and oceans each year as well. Even more concerning, only two per cent of Australian waste is converted to energy. I know that, in other places in the world, the process has been in place for decades where some communities effectively convert most of their waste into energy. I have personally visited plants that do that and seen just how efficiently it can be done. Yet here in Australia we don't seem to be able to do that, and I have to say it is of some disappointment that governments in this country over the years have not embraced available technology for the conversion of waste to energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The net effect of those figures is that it leaves around 45 million tonnes of waste every year to be disposed of. Last year around 4.5 million tonnes of recyclable waste was shipped overseas to Asian countries, including India, Malaysia and Indonesia. But those countries, like China, where previously much of Australia's waste had been exported to, are also closing their doors to Australian waste. So what happens to the remaining 40-odd million tonnes of waste here in Australia? Around half of it goes to landfill. Of course, that comes at both a cost to the environment and an economic cost to society. It is a cost that is rising and that some state governments seem to profit from by applying so-called waste reduction levies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Australia the state government has for some years applied a zero waste levy—that is, a state tax—which was intended to encourage recycling. There is a levy applied to every tonne of waste that ends up in landfill. In 2019, the levy was a hundred dollars per tonne. Since then, the Marshall Liberal government has pushed the levy up to $140 per tonne. In one year, the already hefty levy was increased by 40 per cent. Of course, that increased levy was passed on to communities and ratepayers through both local government rates and the waste industry itself, which had to charge more for collection services. Effectively, it became a tax on the community. The South Australian government's zero waste levy is, quite frankly, blatant backdoor taxation, with most of the funds that are raised ending up in general revenue rather than in the environmental and waste reduction initiatives the levy was intended to fund. As expected, the South Australian Marshall government justifies the very high zero waste tax as a disincentive to sending waste to landfill and an encouragement to recycle more. But, like the Morrison federal government, the South Australian Marshall government have shown no leadership whatsoever in the recycling agenda. Yes, they fiddle around the edges, but in terms of major structural changes to recycling across this country very little has been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only reason this legislation, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020 and associated bills, and the $20 million National Product Stewardship Investment Fund were established is the waste crisis that Australia was confronted with when China and other countries closed their doors to Australian waste. This government then, after seven years in office, had to bring in measures to try to address that situation. I can recall the outcry across Australia from the local government sector when they couldn't send their waste overseas for recycling, it was building up—there were mountains of it—and they didn't know what to do with it. So, effectively, a crisis meeting is called and the government responds. It's a reactive approach to a serious issue that should have been addressed much, much sooner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It comes as no surprise that that was the government's attitude, given their dismissive attitude to environmental responsibilities more broadly. That was made very clear again only a few weeks ago when the government rushed their EPBC legislation through this parliament. They guillotined debate on it because they didn't want members in this place and the Australian public more broadly to understand what they were doing. It highlighted what the government have been wanting to do for years now, in fact ever since coming to office, which is to hand over environmental responsibilities to the states. They want to do that without properly resourcing them or transferring any funds to them to do the oversight that is required. It's a very simplistic way for the government to wash their hands of environmental responsibility, and they finally did that with the EPBC legislation. It was brought into this parliament as a result of a review of the current laws that apply across the country, which needed to be upgraded and strengthened rather than simply handballed to the states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we read stories that across the world, and even in this country, wildlife numbers have plummeted by some two-thirds over the past 50 years because of human activity and the severely degraded land on which we live, it is a real concern that this government takes very little interest in trying to protect and preserve our environment. We know that something like three-quarters of all of our land and 40 per cent of our oceans have been severely degraded over the past decades. Those figures alone are of concern—but then to think that the government simply says, 'But we're not particularly interested in that; our interest is purely economic activity'! And, for the coalition government, economic activity trumps environmental protection every day of the week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a failure by this government to understand that environmental degradation comes at a financial cost to the economy. It comes at a financial cost—</span>

So many people have kept us fed, healthy, connected and alive. But today I want to acknowledge those workers we ask for help when we are in financial stress, and, sadly, there are plenty of people in dire straits. Frontline workers in banks have been stressed all through this awful pandemic and are at heightened risk of infection. FSU members have spoken to me about what they face: people shouting out in anger and anxiety, and sometimes tearful and sobbing, desperate for help. Banking retail outlets have become tension-ridden workplaces, with staff exposed every day. The staff have had their workloads increased inexorably and they are going home with stress etched into their faces. One worker told me her child asks her, when she gets home, did she catch the virus that day? The FSU are asking our incredibly profitable banks for a small financial compensation for their frontline staff. Surely the banks can do this.</span>

This Prime Minister is okay with conduct by the acting minister for immigration, Mr Tudge, that Federal Court judges described as both 'disgraceful' and 'criminal'. This Prime Minister is okay with the unlawful use of $100 million of sports grant money as if it were a Liberal Party slush fund. What about paying a Liberal Party donor more than $30 million for land that's worth a tenth of that, or the use of forged documents by the minister for energy?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the real reasons why, instead of an anticorruption commission that could deal with these scandals, all we have from the Morrison government are delays and desperate excuses. They say COVID stopped them doing it; the fires stopped them doing it; the PM's secret holiday in Hawaii while Australia burned stopped them doing it. The fact is that the Morrison government is terrified of being held to account for the scandals that we know about, and, even more than that, of the other government scandals we don't know about that a national anticorruption commission might uncover. Australians know the reasons why our country needs a national anticorruption commission. But, for the same reasons, this Prime Minister will do everything in his power to prevent one being established.</span>

The federal government is already investing more than $10 billion in improvements to the existing Bruce Highway. The state government is contributing just 20 per cent—okay, as per our funding agreement—but which one of these desperately needed upgrades to the Bruce Highway will Queensland Labor sacrifice to pay for their new thought-bubble highway? Which part of the Bruce will have its extra lane taken away? Which intersection won't be made safe? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A pie-in-the-sky new highway 500 kilometres west of the coast will be no comfort to my constituents who spend hours in grinding traffic on the road into Brisbane, nor the millions who use the Bruce Highway now. It won't be good news for the thousands of local tourists and tourism operators, whose visitors vow never to return to the sunny coast because they can't get home. Traffic is at a standstill now on existing state government roads in my region, like Caloundra Road, Nicklin Way and Kawana Way. We need urgent investment now in roads that people actually use, not a grandiose new multibillion dollar unfunded white elephant. The Queensland Labor government will say anything and do anything to clutch onto power while showing nothing but contempt for the people of South-East Queensland.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Today is Saffron Day. It is a day inspired by the story of a young boy named Deyaan Udani, who tragically died in 2016 whilst on holiday in India with his family. He was a bright seven-year-old and he had discussed organ donation at Quakers Hill Public School in my area, where he went to school. It's about having that conversation about organ donation, because when Deyaan died his precious gift of organ donation gave four people another chance at a full and healthy life. We should all be having that conversation. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three steps to Saffron Day. The first is to register your decision to save lives by registering as an organ donor. The second is to spread the word, updating on social media using the hashtags #saffronday and #doitforDeyaan. The third is to share with your family, encouraging your family to do the same and having the conversation with them about being an organ donor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took the opportunity to look up a few organ donation myths, and there is one that even I didn't understand until I read this today. I have an organ donation preference on my drivers licence, but, as it says on the Saffron Day website, you actually have to register with the Australian Organ Donor Register database, because, if you go into a hospital without your licence, the staff have no way of knowing if you actually wish to donate. So I encourage all Australians to have that conversation and to help save lives.</span>

In recent weeks, the South Australian government has extended its border zone from 40 kilometres to 70 kilometres and is now allowing movement across the border for any reason within this zone. But cross-border residents are still required to be tested every seven days if they want to cross, which is causing massive discomfort for people. Timothy and Annabel Hawkins told me they'd just had their 14th test. This testing is, frankly, intrusive, disturbing and unnecessary, when this region has never had a single case. </span>

They don't help Jane, who can't accompany her quadriplegic father across the border for essential medical treatment. And they don't help Roland, who can't visit his mother, who has a terminal illness. In the meantime, South Australia has opened its border to New South Wales and now to New Zealand. Yes, I know that New Zealand has done very well controlling the virus, but so have cross-border communities in Mallee. The fact that the South Australian government can prioritise international travellers over their own countrymen is disgraceful. New Zealand had 25 confirmed cases yesterday. Mallee had zero. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really lucky to meet the winner of the Judges Award, Julz Strykowski aka—and I'll slow down for her name—'PluckFastic'. Her work <span style="font-style:italic;">Message on a Bottle</span> is really worth seeing, and she is as outrageous as her name. There's also a People's Choice Award; voting is open until this Sunday at 3 pm, so I suggest to anybody listening that they go online and vote. You really won't regret it. The artists are truly amazing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's Annette Innis's reproduction of the Sydney Opera House, which is fashioned out of discarded stationery items, and—I kid you not—the base of the Opera House is made out of pencils and the sky is made out of old wooden rulers, and it's just amazing. It has a light coming off these plastic pens in the sails themselves. It's really amazing. It's an unbelievable work and you really should see it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the artwork by 'The Bowerbird Herd'—Nichola Bryant, to her family—<span style="font-style:italic;">Sing, Maggie</span>, a tribute to the artist's father and a humorous but respectful nod to Australia's favourite bird, the magpie. I swear it's made out of old bicycle tubes. I think I recognise them from my days on the road! So, really, go online, have a look and vote. You won't regret it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Businesses in many areas of my electorate of Robertson are now able to access high-speed fibre broadband as the NBN rolls out their new Business Fibre Initiative. Under this program, businesses in Erina, Gosford, Kincumber, Kariong, Niagara Park, Ourimbah, West Gosford and Woy Woy will be able to request a business-grade broadband service at zero dollars upfront build cost through their retailer. This $700 million investment means that thousands of regional businesses will have access to improved broadband. This initiative by the NBN will transform zoned pricing structures to significantly reduce wholesale pricing for small business. CBD-equivalent wholesale pricing will be offered across all business zones, helping to eliminate the divide between CBD and regional broadband connectivity costs. </span>

Peter from Flipside IT, which specialises in professional IT services, said it would make a huge difference to his clients in fibre zones. He said the additional investment by NBN will enable businesses to boost their digital capabilities, enabling them to remain competitive. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Obviously, COVID-19 has impacted many industries severely, and none more so than the travel industry, which has been feeling the effects of the pandemic from the very start and which will continue to suffer right up until international travel resumes sometime next year or, quite possibly, even later. For many travel agents, revenue is down more than 90 per cent, while new bookings are almost non-existent—plus they're now undertaking the difficult task of processing the estimated $10 billion worth of cancellations and refunds for an estimated four million Australians, even though the agents have lost their commissions for those bookings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, JobKeeper has thrown a lifeline to many businesses, but this won't be enough for an industry on its knees and with such dreadful prospects for another year and quite possibly longer. Surely an industry so deep in the red like this one warrants additional government assistance and warrants it urgently. And surely we as a country can do more to help people like the two travel agents from my electorate who I spoke with recently whose financials are now so bad that they're perilously close to losing everything. The solution here includes the federal government support package proposed by the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, because, as AFTA rightly notes, without such support, further job losses and business closures are 'imminent and inevitable'.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I was very honoured and pleased to join the residents of Gloucester for the opening of the new purpose-built, state-of-the-art nursing home Mirrabooka Place. It's a 50-bed facility with specialist dementia care units, and the absolute beauty of the design, looking out over the Bucketts mountains, is really pleasing. A total of $8½ million of federal funds went into the project, out of Building Better Regions Fund. Five years ago we secured these funds, without which this development wouldn't have happened. Twenty-eight per cent of the population of Gloucester are in the seniors category, as opposed to 15 per cent across New South Wales, so a nursing home is critical for the adequate care of these people.</span>

I'd like to congratulate Anglican Care, the bishop and all the clergy in the Diocese of Newcastle, and I'd like to thank Colin Osborne, the former CEO, who guided this project through to fruition. I'm really proud to have delivered this for the people of Gloucester. There are plenty of things to see and do in Gloucester. If anyone has a spare weekend, drive up Bucketts Way and you'll see all the road improvements, courtesy of Roads of Strategic Importance and the Black Spot Program funding as well as dedicated funding for that artery of commerce heading up into the New England area. It's a beautiful part of New South Wales, so come on down. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Queanbeyan's Chris Neal runs Eclipse Lighting and Sound, a business 21 years in the making. He employs 104 staff, people who would normally be working at events like the Tamworth Country Music Festival and the National Folk Festival. Eight of his staff have been eligible for JobKeeper. That's support that Chris is very grateful for, but, as the JobKeeper rate goes backwards, staff are needing to find better paying jobs in other industries. The skills drain is making him very nervous.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That aside, Chris has watched in despair as football stadiums have swelled with fans while concert halls and music festivals have fallen silent. Chris said: 'I have almost no ability to generate income at the moment. Footy can have up to 40,000 people attending. If a stadium can be at half-capacity for football, why can't the same stadium be used for a concert, with the same restrictions?' Chris doesn't want to stop footy fans from getting to a game; he just wants a level playing field for the jobs and businesses that rely on big events outside of the sporting arena. If sport can continue under COVID-safe controls, let's find a way for the entertainment industry. As Chris says, 'Why does singing have different rules to sports fans' cheering?'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  If a local newspaper is the heartbeat of a town then communities like Collie and Esperance, in my electorate, have been on bypass for the last five months. These towns' only newspapers closed at the start of the COVID pandemic, causing distress to many locals. People died, babies were born, grand finals were won and lost and no-one knew. Thankfully, there's been a transplant and the towns' hearts are pulsing again. A group of hardworking volunteers in Collie have started a new, locally owned and run newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collie River Valley Bulletin</span>. This fantastic weekly publication is being well supported by the community and businesses alike, featuring all of the news and events that people were missing. 'The Bulletin', as it's now colloquially known, is being run by previous employees of town's former newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Collie Mail</span>. Their aim is for the paper to be the record of the life and achievements of the Collie community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Esperance Express</span> newspaper also closed earlier this year, but the owners of the Albany based newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Southern Weekender</span> are looking to expand and launch a new paper, called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esperence Weekender</span>. Earlier this year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Southern Weekender</span> was fortunate to receive support from the government's $50 million Public Interest News Gathering Fund. I sincerely hope the <span style="font-style:italic;">Esperance Weekender</span> gets off the ground so it can keep people updated on the local news in the region. A new online news publication also commenced earlier this year in Bridgetown, run by locals Mark Schneider and Jarad Basterfield. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bridgetown Star</span> aims to become the voice of Bridgetown and fulfil the vital role of providing local news to the community. These three publications are proof that regional newspapers are valued by their communities and have a long future ahead of them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and last Tuesday was Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. Metastatic breast cancer is where the disease has spread, or metastasised, to other parts of the body. Breast Cancer Network Australia has two aims for this month. The first is to encourage the community to recognise that the women—and the smaller number of men—who are living with this cancer are undergoing treatment and dealing with its impacts, yes, but they still work, they still have adventures and they still laugh and love and live their lives. The second aim is to promote understanding about what can be done to improve treatment and care for people living with the disease. I planned to talk mainly about the first aim today, but yesterday we heard the disturbing news that because the government has failed to reach agreement with AstraZeneca the PBAC-approved drug Faslodex is still not listed on the PBS, and, unless the minister gets the negotiations back on track, it may never be listed. So now I'm going to talk about the second aim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three months can be a very long time in the life of a woman with terminal cancer. That's how long ago PBAC approved Faslodex and that's how long Australian women have been waiting for Faslodex to be listed on the PBS. Where other drugs are no longer holding their terminal breast cancer at bay, Faslodex can be the thing that gives women invaluable extra time with family and friends. If it's not listed, around 500 women who are living with terminal cancer right now face the prospect of paying $1,600 a month for Faslodex, instead of as low as $6.60. Please, Minister, deliver on your promise to list every PBAC-approved drug—no ifs, no buts. Australian women deserve it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused many of our local community events to be cancelled or postponed. Two of the major casualties in my electorate of Longman are the Woodford Folk Festival and the Abbey Medieval Festival, both of which are known and loved right across the country. Then, of course, there are the annual agriculture shows, which are the biggest events of the year in many regional towns and do so much to lift community spirit. Now, with restrictions easing, I'm delighted that I can attend the 2020 Farm Fantastic Expo in Caboolture this weekend. Kicking off tomorrow, it will feature dozens of exhibitors, many of them local businesses, as well as fun entertainment for the family, like working-dog and sheep-shearing demonstrations and elite horsemanship demonstrations. The expo showcases products and services for the farming and agriculture industries through country living, outdoor adventure, tools, gadgets, gourmet foods and more. Remember to order your tickets online beforehand, as no tickets will be sold at the gate. COVID-safe restrictions will be in place, so remember to social-distance. If we want local events such as this to go ahead next year, then we all need to do the right thing now. So if you're in the area this weekend, head down to the Caboolture Showgrounds, grab a burger, check out the displays and support this great local expo.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Yesterday, in question time, I sat here in shock at the appalling comments made by our Prime Minister: 'If you're good at your job, you'll get a job.' How rude! How insulting to say that to the hundreds of thousands of Australians who have lost their job through no fault of their own but because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I think about the thousands of aviation workers. You could be the best pilot in Australia or you could be the best maintenance engineer, yet your industry is shut down. You are not able to get a job at what you're good at. I think of the thousands of people working in our universities who have lost their jobs because this Prime Minister wasn't good at his job and didn't extend JobKeeper to that sector. If we had a Prime Minister who was good at his job, he would have introduced JobKeeper before industries started to close down, before people started to lose their jobs—but he didn't. Such cheap rhetoric from this Prime Minister. At a time when people and workers in this country need a leader we have someone who uses question time to belittle, to be mean and to criticise those who are looking for work. Prime Minister: grow up, be good at your job and be the leader this nation needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Victorians have been doing it tough through the long COVID lockdown. My electorate of Higgins is no exception to this. I've been impressed by how resilient and innovative the very many small, medium and family-sized businesses of Higgins have been through the many months of our cold and hard lockdown. Many have adapted to changed circumstances. They now offer takeout, delivery and even click-and-collect services. I'm proud that the residents of Higgins have stepped up magnificently to back our local businesses as they face these unprecedented challenges, whether it's their morning eggplant toasties from Levi in Murrumbeena, coffee at Cafe Republic in South Yarra, grocery shopping at Prahran Market, buying books via click-and-collect at The Novel Idea Toorak Bookshop or servicing their bike at Cycleinn Malvern. Mr Speaker, I can assure you there has been an explosion in cycling in Higgins. It's one of the only reasons you're allowed out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By going local first, money spent in our local economies keeps businesses afloat and supports local jobs and families. This fuels our local economy and will help drive our recovery from the COVID recession. From purchases small and large, to lunches with friends, a new outfit or even home renovations, I encourage the people of Higgins and, indeed, all Australians to look for a local business or tradie, because when you spend local, it stays local.</span>

The Melbourne Vixens claimed their first Super Netball grand final, defeating the West Coast Fever in a nail biting 66-64 victory.

We of course are seeing the all Victorian grand final on Saturday night, with my mighty Richmond Tigers fighting over their third premiership in four years, backed by the roaring Tiger army of 100,000-plus members right across the country. It will be a great game. While my colleagues the members for Corio and Corangamite will be cheering for the navy blue and the white, the member for Cooper and I will once again don our yellow and black and urge the Tigers on for the win.</span>

It's been an extraordinary year. You've made our Tiger hearts roar every time you've played. Thanks for a great season and for giving us something or cheer for in what has been a difficult year. We'll be cheering you on in this victory, we hope you paint Brisbane yellow and black!</span>

She is, </span>without a doubt, as hardworking a person as I have ever met. We met 10 years ago when I was campaigning to win this seat. She was a great supporter, coach and mentor.</span>

She is, of course, our own Gladys Berejiklian. I've met many politicians in the last 10 years but, without fear of contradiction, I don't know anyone who can surpass her in integrity, diligence and determination to improve New South Wales for all of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That New South Wales has handled this pandemic so well, with jobs returning and life ongoing, is a real testament to her leadership and stick-to-it-iveness. Integrity, honesty and modesty are her hallmarks. Her passion, drive and energy have seen us through this and other challenges. But also her leadership has turned this state back into the nation's economic powerhouse, so, on behalf of all of New South Wales, I'd like to simply say, 'Thank you, Gladys.' I'm proud to call Gladys Berejiklian a friend—a very special friend.</span>

The Geelong Football Club was established in 1859, 19 years before Manchester United and more than a century before the Dallas Cowboys. It's the second-oldest football club of any code in the world. We won our first premiership in 1878 in the Victorian Football Association, and our last in 2011 in the Australian Football League.</span>

Back in March, when the lockdown first happened, our coach, Chris Scott, volunteered not to be paid at all. The team has been on the road since 6 July, more than 100 days with long separations from their families. Our remarkable CEO, earlier this week, when he was named the Geelong Business Leader of the Year, said, 'I never really wanted to be recognised as the best leader but I love being the leader of the best team.'</span>

We also take inspiration from another Geelong identity, Tegan Philip, who was victorious with the Vixens last weekend. We're up against a soulless national corporate brand—for those who haven't grown up with the AFL, like the Prime Minister, you can think about this as a contest between a fighting local community and, I don't know, maybe Coca-Cola. The Geelong Football Club stands for everything that is good and right in this world. On Saturday night the whole nation will be behind you. Go Cats!</span>

I couldn't have stopped him! I try to be impartial in this business, but I think the photographers have had the photos of the scarfs. I'm tempted to ask the attendants to collect all the Richmond paraphernalia and remove it from the chamber, as a loyal Carlton supporter!

Senator Stoker made time for more questions about tweets but said that aged-care deaths weren't relevant. How on earth can the government claim that 680 deaths in aged care are not relevant but Twitter is?</span>

As we know, the majority of those deaths have occurred to those who have been most vulnerable, and those most vulnerable do live in our residential aged-care facilities. Appropriately, the royal commission on aged care was tasked with also dealing directly with the issues that related to COVID-19 and the management of those matters in our aged-care facilities. The government takes that extraordinarily seriously and that's why we asked the aged-care commission to do that.</span>

I see it as the job of Senate estimates to probe into matters regarding integrity. I do. That's its role. That's the role of this parliament. Questions are raised in this chamber as, indeed, they are in estimates. That is the responsibility of members of parliament and that's what senators are doing, whether it's in their capacity at estimates or other places, and that's what members do here.</span>

As I have remarked on many occasions, back at the start of this year when the virus was first emerging out of China many returning Australians from China to Australia, through their actions in isolating—after we moved quickly to shut the borders and only allow residents returning to Australia—her community, did so much to protect Australia from that first wave of COVID-19 here in Australia that we owe them a great debt. To the member for Chisholm: I thank her for her strong leadership working with her community to ensure that they were encouraged and supported during that time, and that continues to this day, because our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the COVID-19 recession that has followed, is to ensure that Australians have been getting the right support when it comes to their health needs—definitely. There's been unprecedented investment to support the health response to COVID-19. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the response to support Australians both to cushion the blow of the COVID-19 recession and then, through this budget and measures that were introduced before this budget, to ensure that we had a strong plan for recovery out of the COVID-19 recession and to build for the future is seeing Australians get back into work. It's seeing businesses reopen again. It's seeing Australians find that hope they've been searching for that is so critical at times like this. The response to the budget has given Australians hope, we've seen a confidence rebound, but there is still much further to go. The national cabinet will meet tomorrow. It will be our 30th meeting this year. I want to thank the premiers and chief ministers for the way they have worked together with the Commonwealth over these many months. There have been disagreements from time to time, but the work has continued and there is so much more to do as we continue to ensure that Australia moves forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't stay still when it comes to our response to COVID-19. We must continue to move forward, whether it is on the health front or the economic front, on the support that is provided to help Australians through—in particular, Victorians, who have gone through the hardest of it over these many months. We need to move forward and we need to safely reopen Australia. Some months ago we talked about the need to get Australia open again by Christmas, and we remain committed to that goal. I thank the premiers and chief ministers, who are sharing that commitment to ensure Australians can go into 2021 with great confidence, with a strong working partnership at all levels of government in this country.</span>

That is why the government invested more than $1½ billion in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the area of aged care. The shocking news we knew would come forward out of a royal commission into aged care—when I initiated that royal commission, I said Australians needed to prepare themselves. I said we would need to prepare ourselves for some difficult and horrifying news on the practices that have gone on in aged care over generations, over decades. That matter was referred to by the royal commissioner himself outlining what we would expect to see come forward and the areas that would be investigated over these many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year, our government has continued to increase our investment in aged care by $1 billion every single year, and more. In this most recent budget, we have the single largest increase in in-home aged-care places. We have more than tripled the number of in-home aged-care places since we came to government. In-home aged-care places was one of the key recommendations made in the interim report of the royal commission that we responded to last year. We said we would respond again in this year's budget—and we have. Again in the midyear statement and again in next year's budget we will have a comprehensive response to the royal commission recommendations when they are handed down again next year. I thank the royal commission for the work they are doing. I thank all of those Australians who are coming to that royal commission.</span>

I believe the same thing will flow from the royal commission into aged care, which is why I initiated it. This is a matter that we have to deal with as a parliament and as a government. We are dealing with it is a government but there is more to do. I think the royal commission will greatly aid us in that quest to join together to focus on the matters that need to be addressed in aged care. That's why I called the royal commission. That's why I'm looking forward to its recommendations. The news that comes from is difficult for all of us. So many of us in this place have sat around cabinet tables on either side of politics and dealt with the issues of aged care, and all of us know there is more to be done.</span>

The matter of road safety, I know, is an important one to the member and to each and every member in this place. In his inaugural speech, the member for Lyne emphasised the importance of infrastructure investment in improving road safety. I also acknowledge the work of the member for Cowper as the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Road Safety. I acknowledge Senator Alex Gallacher in the other place for what he has always said about road safety.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year's budget, I know the government was very, very pleased to announce $2 billion in road safety upgrades. That's $2,000 million that is going to go to important work in improving road safety measures for regional areas. This will include works such as shoulder sealing, rumble strips and physical barriers which can prevent vehicles from detouring off and prevent head-on collisions and the like. In urban areas, works will focus on separating vulnerable users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, from vehicular traffic. President of the Australian Local Government Association David O'Loughlin said, 'We congratulate the federal government on having a clear focus on road safety, especially for our extensive rural and regional network, which will make a real difference in so many ways.'</span>

There is $2 billion split over three tranches, making sure that the money is going to be spent as a 'use it or lose it' system. We want the states and territories to get on with shovel-ready projects that are going to improve road safety outcomes for all Australians, whether they live in regional areas or metropolitan cities. We will continue to invest in road safety to align with and to support states and territories in working towards Vision Zero.

I was asked yesterday about appointments to positions within the government. That's what I was asked about. There are a million people, who, through the course of this COVID-19 recession, have found themselves out of work through no fault of their own. The government has been absolutely clear about that. Not only have we been clear about the fact that this COVID-19 recession, which was caused by a global pandemic—something those opposite fail to appreciate, acknowledge or understand. By contrast, the government understands that the people who have lost their job through this COVID-19 recession have lost their job through no fault of their own. But we've gone beyond that, by putting in place the $101 billion JobKeeper program that has provided a lifeline to three million Australians—and more—and by doubling the JobKeeper payments through the COVID supplement to help Australians get through the worst of this crisis and to cushion the blow. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, when it comes to the response to the COVID-19 recession and the pandemic, the impact has been cushioned more than in almost any other country in the world today. Only a handful of countries—South Korea, Finland, Norway, Australia—and economies like Taiwan can actually speak of the sorts of ways that we've been able to act to cushion the blows to the very constituent that you speak of. That is why the JobTrainer program provides 340,000 places right now. For the Labor Party to come in here and take comments that are made and apply them to completely different contexts is a grubby smear and an insult to all of those Australians, and it seeks to misrepresent. The Labor Party needs to learn how to tell the truth.</span>

In answer to the member's question, can I say to the member that on 4 September 2020 I announced a $269 million package of investments to put communities and jobs back at the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I would also say to the member that this has been a very long-running proposal from both sides of government. In fact, some $9 billion of the $13 billion has already been spent on the Murray-Darling Basin to support the implementation of the Basin Plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the heart of the member's question, quite simply, I don't think it's likely that there will be court action for something which is yet to happen. We have until 2024 to meet the requirements of the Basin Plan. We are committed to meeting those requirements. We will deliver on the commitments that we have made. I come from business. Four years is a very long time and $4 billion is an awful lot of money, and we want to ensure that we get that delivered into communities—driving jobs, driving investment and supporting the outcomes of the plan. So I say to the member that that's a very good question, and I'm still in discussions with our South Australian counterparts, as we continue to talk to all members of the Murray-Darling community. But we will deliver on our commitment. We have made further commitments in terms of the Murray-Darling investment package and will continue to do what is necessary to strike the right balance between the environment, between business, between irrigators and between communities. But we are putting communities back at the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. </span>

The member for Barker, like all those on this side of the House, understands that the Australian economy has been hit by a once-in-a-century pandemic and it has been hit hard. Many people have either lost their jobs or seen their work hours reduced to zero. As a response we have put in place measures, like JobKeeper, like JobSeeker, like the cash flow boost and like the $750 payments to millions of pensioners, carers, veterans and others on income support. We have helped save 700,000 jobs, and now the economic recovery is underway.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">446,000 jobs have been created in the last four months alone. Consumer confidence is now up seven weeks in a row, having recovered 95 per cent off its lows earlier on in the pandemic. Consumer sentiment was up 11.9 per cent last week, the single largest increase in a budget month since the series first began in 1974. And this week Australia's AAA credit rating was again reaffirmed. As a result of this economic recovery underway, I was able to go and see it firsthand in the member's electorate of Barker, where I went to Murray Bridge and I went to Kookaburra Homes. I met Steve and his other staff, including apprentices, working on cabinet-making. That business employs more than 40 people but indirectly supports hundreds of jobs through the supply chain. Steve told us firsthand how the HomeBuilder program had seen a massive jump in sales, helping in his words, to secure his business into the future. This is the economic recovery that is now underway.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in the budget we had a number of new initiatives to support businesses and families right across the country, like Steve's Kookaburra Homes. These included the instant asset write-off, which was expanded to allow equipment and machinery to be written off all in year 1; the loss carryback measure; and, of course, the income tax cuts for more than 11½ million Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know that only one side of this House supports lower taxes for Australians. Those opposite don't; the member for McMahon took $387 billion of higher taxes to the last election—higher taxes on your income, higher taxes on your savings, higher taxes on your investments. Only those on this side of the House stand for lower taxes and leaving more money in Australians' pockets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:26</span>):  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I commend her for the work she's doing in the manufacturing sector in her electorate of Lindsay, establishing the advanced manufacturing task force, which is critical to businesses in her electorate—businesses like Plustec, which manufactures windows, and SpanSet, which produces safety harnesses in the building construction industry. Like all of us on this side of the House, she understands how important affordable, reliable energy is for Australian manufacturing, Australian workers and Australian households of course. She knows that gas is central, in our energy mix, to the economic recovery, supporting the jobs of 850,000 Australians working in our manufacturing sector in producing critical goods like fertiliser for agriculture; PPE, which is used in so many different industries; and building materials as well of course. And she knows that we're empowering customers in the gas industry, that we're unlocking supply in projects like Narrabri in New South Wales and, of course, investing in critical infrastructure—pipelines and transport of gas. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lindsay asked about alternative approaches. The members opposite's position on gas is not to have a consistent position. The opposition to gas from many of those opposite is an attack on the livelihoods and wellbeing of so many Australian workers, their families and the businesses that employ them. As the Australian Workers Union has noted—the Australian Workers Union, no less—the 'New South Wales manufacturing sector is unreservedly underpinned by the economics of gas'. 'Unreservedly underpinned'—now that doesn't sound like an industry with no future, as the member for Hindmarsh would have it. You abandon gas; you abandon the jobs of Australian workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder that the head of the AWU, Daniel Walton, has labelled the member for Hindmarsh's position 'not just morally indefensible, it's strategically moronic'—strategically moronic, Mr Speaker! He goes on to say we 'may as well kiss goodbye to our heavy manufacturing sector' if we follow the advice of the member for Hindmarsh. That's what you get if you rely on the advice of the member for Hindmarsh. Only the Morrison government has a plan for jobs and economic recovery.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  I thank the member for Berowra for his question. Yesterday, I spoke about how the Morrison government is driving a billion-dollar transformation in the waste and recycling industry, creating 10,000 jobs over the next decade, and our budget continues our government's commitment to protecting our environment and Australia's economic recovery, with an additional $1.8 billion in new investments, protecting our oceans, preserving national parks and heritage areas, recovering our unique natural environment from bushfires, and, as we come out of COVID, supporting jobs in regional communities. We're spending $233 million—the largest ever investment in our national parks—creating more than 1,100 rural and remote jobs in Uluru, Kakadu, Booderee and Christmas and Norfolk islands. Thirty-three million dollars will provide infrastructure upgrades across our World Heritage sites, from the wet tropics in the north, through the Gondwana rainforests of the Great Dividing Range, to the Tasmanian overland trails and the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the significance of our Indigenous, convict and military history, more than $60 million is being invested for the maintenance and restoration of Sydney Harbour Federation Trust sites, including on Cockatoo Island and Sub Base Platypus. Reef HQ in Townsville is getting further upgrades, taking our investment in the world's largest living coral reef aquarium to more than $40 million since last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures demonstrate our commitment to protecting, preserving and showcasing our unique natural environment and the communities it sustains. Twenty-eight million dollars will be invested to sustainably manage our marine park network—3.3 million square kilometres; one of the biggest in the world. Fourteen million dollars will be invested in cleaning up lost and discarded fishing gear, or 'ghost nets', throughout the waters and beaches of northern Australia. And we're continuing our investment in the International Partnership for Blue Carbon, to assist our Pacific family to tackle problems with marine pollution. Twenty million dollars we're investing in building oyster reefs that stabilise coastlines, clean the water and create thousands of kilograms of new fish stocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our precious native species remain a critical focus as we continue to roll out over $200 million of bushfire habitat recovery. Our environmental protection draws heavily on Commonwealth-led research from our National Environmental Science Program, backing our on-ground practical action with work in areas like threatened species climate adaptation, marine parks and Landcare activities. We are providing economic and environmental leadership.</span>

Today, as the House knows, marks two years since the Prime Minister apologised to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse—a period of Australian history that should not be forgotten. Can I acknowledge the very fine words of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition this morning. The Redress Scheme was a key recommendation of the resulting royal commission. The royal commission made 84 recommendations, all of which have been implemented through the 10-year National Redress Scheme, which commenced in 2018. The latest figures I can report, as reflected by the Prime Minister this morning, are that 8,297 applications have been received and 4,670 decisions have been made, with payments totalling some $320 million—an average of approximately $82,000 per applicant. Nearly 300 non-government organisations, on top of state, territory and Commonwealth government institutions, have signed up. This includes sporting groups, churches, local community organisations and schools. It covers 53,000 sites. It's clear that, together, we are on the right track. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The date of 31 December this year marks another crucial date for the scheme. We're actively working with 158 institutions who have committed to join but have not yet done so. Sadly, four institutions have decided not to join, being Fairbridge, Jehovah's Witnesses, Kenja Communication and Lakes Entrance Pony Club. I think it's clear that we are firm in our resolve on this issue. Should any of the 158 institutions not fully commit and join the scheme by the end of the year, after having six months or more to join, they will be publicly named and face the same consequences as the four institutions just named. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving the scheme and ensuring survivors of institutional child sexual abuse are supported remains a clear priority for us all. We're now in the process of reviewing the scheme, with an additional $104.6 million over the next four years to further fund redress support services and employ further independent decision-makers. We anticipate the review will be presented to the government early next year, with recommendations to be considered by the Ministers Redress Scheme Governance Board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I echo the Prime Minister's fine statement today. No current or future named institution that refuses to join will be the beneficiary of any government grants, funding source or preferential tax treatment. They will not advance while victims and survivors remain forgotten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know there's more to do. We have over seven more years of the scheme's life, and that will mean further improvements. We can't undo the wrongs of the past, but we are taking meaningful steps to address those wrongs.</span>

Earlier today, when this was brought to my attention by the report of Senate estimates, I was appalled. It's disgraceful and it's not on. And so immediately I spoke with the shareholding minister, the Minister for Finance, and the minister responsible, the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, and from those discussions the following actions ensued: that there had to be an independent investigation done by the department, not by Australia Post; that the chief executive should stand aside immediately; and that the independent investigation should look into the conduct of the board members and their governance as well as the actions of the management and the executive. That report will come back to me and the members of my cabinet, and if there are issues to be addressed with board members then they will be addressed then.</span>

So appalled and shocked was I by that behaviour—any shareholder would in a company raise their outrage if they had seen that conduct by a chief executive, a management or a board; they would insist rightly on the same thing. Now, we are the shareholders of Australia Post on behalf of the Australian people, so that action was immediate. The chief executive has been instructed to stand aside and, if she doesn't wish to do that, she can go.</span>

I just don't see any higher priority for our government, for our nation, than protecting Australian children. I want to make sure that we can do everything we can within the Home Affairs portfolio to protect children and women in particular. When you look at the activities online of crime syndicates and those people who are involved in sexual predatory behaviour, you see that we need to provide support to the agencies to defeat those activities and to keep our Australian children safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have managed the budget well, and it's put us in a position where we can prepare our country in the best way possible to deal with this virus and the consequences of it. And the consequences don't just relate to the health impacts on Australians, because we do know that we have seen quite a surge in the number of activities online detected by the Australian Federal Police and the other agencies within the Home Affairs portfolio, particularly around people who are targeting children, who are spending more and more time online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the AFP have received considerable support in this budget. We've invested $300 million over four years to strengthen the work of the Australian Federal Police, and I'm incredibly proud of the work that they do, particularly at the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. I'll be back in Brisbane tomorrow morning to officially open that facility, and it's a $70 million investment that we've been able to make. It's the biggest investment in Australia's history into protecting Australian children from the scourge of those who would seek to abuse children either online or in the real world. I want to praise the work of the investigators, of the intelligence analysts and of the NGOs who will be involved. Bruce and Denise Morcombe will be there tomorrow, and other NGOs will work with us, as they have done over a long period of time, to make sure that we can look at innovative ways in which we can deliver messages to kids at school to help people stay safe online and to make sure that we can speak to parents about having an active discussion with their children to make sure that they are safe online. I want to highlight the fact that from 1 July 2019 to 30 June this year ACCCE received 21,000 incoming reports of child exploitation. That is compared to 14,000 reports in the previous financial year—a dramatic increase. And, over the period of COVID, the centre identified a 163 per cent increase in child abuse material on the dark web in the three months of April to June of 2020, compared to the same period last year. It's why the work is absolutely essential, and it's why we'll continue to work hard to make sure that our budget is in good shape to help protect Australians and, in particular, children online. </span>

The debate around the Integrity Commission, as evidenced by that question, should be—but never is when the opposition is involved—dealing with facts. They just cannot bring themselves to deal with actual facts, not even in talking about something as important as an integrity commission. The question goes to the time line of the government's development of and consultation for an integrity commission, and I can explain that time line for the House. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first time that this really became an issue was when members opposite were previously in government. The opposition's previous position was stated by the shadow Attorney-General when they were last in government. That was, in his words, 'I am not convinced that there is a need for yet another integrity officer.'

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The time line for that commission was such that Labor supported, as the Leader of the Opposition said, the Commonwealth Integrity Commission before the last election. They said that they would need a 12-month period after that election to ready a bill, so that would have been May of 2020 this year. They further noted—in fact, the shadow A-G went on to note—that as well as drafting they'd need time for consultation. Eminently sensible. The shadow A-G said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… we also acknowledge that designing a body as complex and as significant as this is properly the work of government, with all the resources available to government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So whether Labor, had they been in government, would have devoted all of the resources of government in May this year at the height of a global pandemic to a complicated, significant, complex, intensive consultation period on an integrity commission, or whether they would have applied all of the resources available to government to dealing with the pandemic, is, thankfully, something we will not find out, but it would have been a very strange decision. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also true that the government received its first draft of the bill in December of last year, which I might note is much earlier than their time line of 12 months. One of the things that I have been doing is looking at ways in which you can improve that draft bill, and one thing that I am absolutely convinced that that draft must have is a mechanism to prevent vexatious, baseless, politically motivated time-wasting referrals. And why is that? That's because of the shadow Attorney-General, who has an Australian record of 10 baseless—</span>

How is it that the government still found time to establish a Higher Education Integrity Unit to look into cheating students in the middle of the pandemic in Melbourne but not a national integrity commission to look into sports rorts, water rorts, airport rorts, forged documents and taxpayer funds being used for Liberal Party branch stacking?</span>

And that was on the shadow Attorney-General—whose words I completely agree with—describing the complexity of dealing with an integrity commission. This is what the shadow Attorney-General said about that—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  No, the Attorney-General needs to be relevant to the question. It doesn't preclude him, I say, from quoting, where he's relating that material to why the government has taken a certain position. But, where he was crossing the line—where he was ending his previous answer when I was about to sit him down—was where he was moving beyond that. But, if he's quoting someone as explaining the complexity of a government position, that's fine. But I'll listen carefully.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the question also went to why the government has chosen not to engage in a consultation period around this very complicated integrity commission and has chosen to do other things. Why have we chosen to do other things? The government chose to focus all of the resources of government on dealing with a global pandemic which threatened hundreds of thousands and millions of Australian jobs. So what types of things were we focusing our time and energy on? We were looking at developing flexibilities inside the industrial relations system to save hundreds of thousands of jobs. We looked at passing privacy legislation so we could establish a COVIDSafe app which would allow states like New South Wales to successfully contact trace. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would also note for the member for Sydney is that the work on the Integrity Commission, as I described yesterday, is actually already underway in this budget—in this budget—with the allocation of very substantial increases in funding to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which will increase its ASL by 38 staff members so that it can be the first part of this Integrity Commission, which has to be designed carefully. When you are looking at something like examinations for tertiary students, that does not involve something as delicate and as important as the extent to which, if any, you have retrospectivity applying around the criminal law of the Commonwealth of Australia to activities that occurred before and to different standards. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And we've changed the definition of decentralisation so that it no longer supports relocations from the inner city to the outer suburbs of big cities. We are turbocharging the government's decentralisation agenda, and there is an enormous amount of interest in decentralisation. Those people wanting to move from the city to the country were once called tree changers or sea changers, but Bernard Salt coined a new phrase in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> recently. Those folks are now known as VESPAs: 'virus escapees seeking provincial Australia'. We want the VESPAs to come to country Australia.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for International Development and the Pacific and Assistant Defence Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:00</span>):  I want to thank the member for Fairfax for this important question and note his experience in the agricultural sector with the work he has done in advocating for Australia's place in the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pacific labour mobility has made a vital contribution to Australia in recent years, with up to 12,000 workers a year working in the agricultural sector, making an important contribution. It's also one of the most important parts of our regional engagement. When I visit people in the region I find that the economic contribution we make through Pacific workers to villages and people working back in country is immense. While we fill these critical workforce shortages in our agricultural sector, we know those vital remittances really do make a great contribution to the GDP of so many countries in the region. That's why, from the beginning of this crisis, the government acted from the outset to ensure and preserve access so the Pacific Labour Scheme could continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 4 April we announced those visa measures that enabled people who were here to remain for an extra 12 months and to redeploy to approved employers. And then on 4 August we announced the approved pilot measure, with the Northern Territory for the mango season, to make sure we could bring on people into industry and demonstrate to states and territories it was safe to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 21 August the government announced the support of the states and territories, through national cabinet recruitment under the Pacific Labour Scheme, that the Seasonal Worker Program would resume more broadly. Today I'm pleased to announce to the House the first cohort of 161 workers from Vanuatu, under the restart of the scheme, arrived in Darwin last week. Those people are in quarantine. And I'm further pleased to tell the House that all 10 partner countries—Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Timor-Leste—have agreed to restart their schemes. That means 15,000 eligible, job-ready workers, who have experience in Australia and have been pre-vetted, are ready to come to Australia and supply our markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also remind the House of the immense success of the Pacific countries in protecting themselves from COVID. Fourteen of the 17 countries in the world that are COVID free are in the Pacific region. We're going to continue working with the states and territories to bring here as many people as we can under these vital schemes to protect jobs and help with our economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the New South Wales government, who just this week announced that they will bring 350 workers from Fiji under the Pacific Labour Scheme to fill labour shortages in the meat-processing industry. We welcome that development in New South Wales. As we know, there are more plans for more charter flights and more workers to come back to Australia. We know the vital importance of these schemes to our agriculture and primary production sectors and also to our neighbours, with the economic contribution to their GDP and to the villagers and people of the Pacific. This government will keep working with the states and territories to get every worker we can here to meet those critical workforce shortages, supply our labour needs and also do great economic recovery for the Pacific and our region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great opportunity, last week, to go to Queensland and share with Queenslanders from the Gold Coast all the way up to Cairns, through Townsville, through Rockhampton and through the suburbs of Brisbane, the economic recovery plan that was handed down by the Treasurer when we last sat in this place two weeks ago, whether it was at Caboolture smash repairs, the steel fabricators, the coral trout exporters in Cairns or visiting apprentices, trainees, businesses and communities across Queensland. It was so exciting to hear from businesses about how they are graduating from JobKeeper—a JobKeeper program that ensured they could keep their business together, keep their employees together. Then on the other side they could shift gear. They could shift gear and grow again, and put on more apprentices, put on more trainees, bring employees back that they had to let go, and increase their hours.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland last week I had the opportunity—as did the Deputy Prime Minister, who was also in Queensland going up and down the Bruce Highway with the minister for resources—to see the great work being done by our magnificent members, whether it is the member for Herbert or the member for Dickson. I was with the member for Dickson in a sign-making business which is doing a remarkable job investing in new technology. All of these businesses, all of these communities, understand that this budget was the budget that Australia needed. It was the budget Queensland needed to get Queenslanders working again, to see Queenslanders coming back into jobs, because for Queensland to go forward it is important—</span>

If the question just did that—we have been over this ground before—you would have a point. But when a question asks the Prime Minister why he spent the week campaigning he's entitled to explain how he spent the week. He's refuting that part of the question.

In speaking to the apprentices, the business owners and those who are working to get Queensland working again it made me reflect again: how good is Queensland? How good is Queensland? The Leader of the Opposition wouldn't know, because the Queensland government won't let him come to Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition couldn't spend 14 days in the ACT to spend a day in Queensland. I welcomed the welcome from the Queensland Premier to come to Queensland. Bu there's one person who's not welcome in Queensland: the Leader of the Opposition. He's not that welcome in Newcastle either, according to the member for Hunter. There was a time you had to get on a bullock train to get from Maitland to Newcastle. That would've been an excuse, but you can get there in about half an hour now— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Nicholls for his question. I recognise that he is a strong and fierce advocate for his community. I would imagine last week he would've been incredibly proud of his community, as what could've been quite a disastrous outbreak of COVID-19 in the Shepparton area saw a remarkable community effort, not only from the health authorities—the doctors, the nurses—but from the entire community. They managed what could've been a serious outbreak to a very, very low level of infection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Shepparton, regional Australia has done very, very well during this pandemic. Regional communities have managed to handle the small number of infections that we've had. The rest of Australia has recognised that regional Australia is now the place to be. As we've seen in previous generations people are looking to the regions now to invest, to move, to look for jobs—the thousands of jobs that are available there right across the full spectrum, from the professions right through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget the government recognised that if we are going to have a growing and prosperous region we need to have a health profession that is capable of looking after this expected growth. That's why we've put extra funds in the budget to be prepared for further outbreaks of COVID, for telehealth funding, the respiratory clinics and more capacity for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. But we've also put funding into things that will stimulate professionals looking to study and practise medicine in the regions. We've put $125 million into rural clinical trials so that not only will the people in regional Australia get the benefit of those life-saving trials but professionals who want to undertake that research can do that in a regional area. There is $50 million for extending rural training. That builds on what we've done in previous budgets with the Murray-Darling Medical Schools—training local people in local regions. Indeed, the member for Nicholls will have a facility in Shepparton as part of the Murray-Darling Medical Schools. We all know that people who train in and come from the regions are more likely to settle and work in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget, we also funded five trials looking at a multidisciplinary approach in New South Wales to delivering health care to smaller, more isolated communities. The Rural Health Commissioner, Professor Stewart, will be looking at how they go—trials that were built from the community. Knowing that the government does not know best—communities know best—supporting those communities and what works will be spread out and looked at across other areas of the country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Once again, in the face of the biggest recession we have seen in this country since the Great Depression, which was of course caused by COVID-19—despite those challenges and the unprecedented investment to keep Australians in work to provide that lifeline to people's jobs and their livelihoods, and the unprecedented investments in health services and mental health services and the massive hit that that took to the budget—Standard and Poor's looked at the government's fiscal management and economic management and they concluded that Australia's balance sheet was strong as it went into this crisis. It was tested during this crisis but was able to stand to this crisis—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question went to airport rorts, cash for visas, secret taxpayer funded market research, looking after Liberal Party mates and Cartier watches worth 12 grand. The Prime Minister hasn't mentioned any of those issues.</span>

These questions that simply ask a minister or the Prime Minister to confirm several things invite a yes/no answer, but the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> makes it very clear that, while they can invite that, that can't be required. Questions that just say, 'Can you confirm it's Thursday?' make it very, very difficult and it does allow those answering to answer in the way the Prime Minister is. I've been listening carefully to him. I'll keep listening. The Prime Minister has the call.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I can also reveal that this week it was revealed in the consumer confidence surveys, for the first time since they began in the early seventies, that this budget has impacted positively on Australian consumers' confidence more than any budget since that time. And that is exactly what Australians needed; they needed this budget to give them the confidence. There's only one assumption that really matters in this budget, and that's an assumption that we have made, as a government, in putting this budget together, as we have continued over the course of this week to outline the many measures, as ministers have responded to in questions today and all week—</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I was asked to confirm things, and I have confirmed that there has been an historic response to this budget. That is the point I am making. If I could go on in making that point—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  You related your material to the question, Prime Minister, and I outlined what I thought was the deficiency in the type of questioning that invites a yes/no answer. That can't be compelled, and you're entitled to confirm a number of things that you've already done. But, as I say, moving on from that to a general answer about the budget and everything the budget does is not the same as confirming all of those facts and figures that you did earlier. The question didn't mention the budget at all.</span>

                  </a>  I can confirm that the government is providing lower taxes. I can confirm that we're supporting businesses. I can confirm that we're supporting Australians to get back into work. I can confirm that we're providing record support through the JobTrainer program—some 340,000 training places in partnerships with the states and territories. I can confirm we've put $14 billion into new and accelerated infrastructure projects to support a further 40,000 jobs in this country. I can confirm that HomeBuilder is supporting construction jobs all around the country. I can confirm we're backing manufacturing, through the minister for industry's plan, to ensure that advanced manufacturing jobs will be here. I can confirm all of those matters because they assume that the Australian people know how to respond to a crisis. That's the assumption we've made about the Australian people in all the decisions we've made. We're believing in the Australian people, first and foremost, in how we are recovering from the COVID-19 recession.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I thank the member for O'Connor for his continued support and commitment to Indigenous women and children in his seat. The Morrison government is committed to advancing opportunities for Indigenous women and girls, given the historical disadvantage and some of the challenges that they face. We're providing significant investments through all Commonwealth agencies to provide support for women, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and girls. We've provided $99.6 million to support education, leadership, health and wellbeing outcomes for girls and young women; $72.4 million for academy and mentoring projects to improve year 12 attainment and support students into post-school pathways; $25 million for the Indigenous girls science, technology, engineering and mathematics academy; $2.2 million to support girls and young women through sport and other youth development activities to empower them to realise their potential; more than $75 million for family violence prevention and legal services to address family violence; a further $13.8 million investment in the Indigenous women's program legal services and supplementary legal assistance activities over three years, from 2020-21 to 2022-23; an additional $35 million investment in Indigenous-specific measures under the Fourth Action Plan; and $2.9 million for the Wiyi Yani U Thangani (Women's Voices) project. This is also made up of the job opportunities that we've created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been into some of the academies and schools where the programs operate. I went into one in particular, a group of young high school women. When I went in, they asked me to go through a process that they'd put in place to create a secure and safe environment for them. They asked me to pick up the object that they hold while they make this commitment to honour each other's confidence. What I saw was young women who had been damaged regain confidence to speak and share what they had experienced to provide peer support to each other. Deadly Sista Girlz, with the Wirrpanda Foundation, not only achieve academic outcomes but provide levels of support and interaction. When we consider some of the adverse events we see through media, we know these programs are absolutely important and critical in giving young women a journey that is better than what we would expect for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our investment for the boys, about which I was asked, is $54 million. For the girls in the same program it is $57 million. So our commitment is extremely strong to young women and young girls.</span>

I congratulate all those competing in the AFL grand final, of which there's been much commentary and much spirit in question time today—Geelong and Richmond.

It was a great relief for all of us who enjoy these things to be able on a weekend to see those great matches, see the great contests. We're going to see it again this evening. I congratulate the AFL's Gil McLachlan and Richard Goyder for their great leadership through this season of the AFL. And I congratulate Peter V'landys and Andrew Abdo, who have also shown great strength in making sure that everyone got on the park this year. We look forward to some great contests this weekend.</span>

I think that both of those teams, as Victorian teams, have had it particularly tough during this season, and they deserve absolute credit—the players and all of the clubs associated with them—for what is a remarkable achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Melbourne Storm, who are playing on Saturday night, have based themselves on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, away from their family, friends and homes. That is particularly tough, and it's a great achievement for them to get through to the grand final. My head says they'll be successful. My heart says Penrith! But I do think that Melbourne Storm have been the most successful team over the last decade. I hope it is a good game and I hope it's not decided by one foot being on the wrong side of the line in a 40/20 kick, which is what happened with Adam Reynolds last week—and no, Mr Speaker, I'm not over it yet! Three preliminary finals in a row we've lost, South Sydney, but I wish them all well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, on the Rugby League Women's grand final between the Roosters and the Broncos: it's been a great initiative that women are playing in big numbers. There's been big growth in women and young girls playing rugby league and AFL. So, to everyone associated with those sports: it has been good, during what has been a difficult year, for people to be able to watch the footy on the weekend, and I congratulate all associated with the codes.</span>

Like a number of members of this chamber, I quarantined for a fortnight to be here for this sitting. I don't recommend it. I know that my Victorian colleagues watching on videopresence today would have dearly loved to have been here today, but personal circumstances did not allow them to spend a month away from their families in order to attend today. I must say that we have noted the comments of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the health minister and the acting immigration minister recognising the incredible efforts of Victoria in fighting this second wave of COVID-19 and, more particularly, the equivalence that they now draw between New South Wales and Victoria about the health situation in these respective states. Given this and in this context, I ask if you could provide the House with an update on the ability of Victorian members to attend the sitting starting on 9 November, for which under current arrangements members would need to begin quarantining in coming days.</span>

As I, as the Speaker of the House, and the President of the Senate have made clear to the House and the Senate together, we have always sought the health advice. We've acted consistently on that advice all the way through. At the moment, it is unchanged. The quarantine period and the travel restrictions are, of course, a decision of the ACT government. In fact, there will be a communication going out very shortly, if not while I'm speaking, about that sitting fortnight, but the restrictions remain unchanged at this point. I have been asked about this by a number of members, as you would expect, and so it's useful to receive the question to communicate it more widely. Obviously, the President of the Senate and I regularly receive advice on what can be done and we have always acted on that advice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in terms of a way to approach this, I noticed the New South Wales Premier earlier in the week—I read it in the newspaper—said at a press conference that her government would look in a couple of weeks at when they might lift the restrictions with respect to Victoria. Obviously that is based on the fact that Victoria's numbers have come down and some of the restrictions have come off. That was at the earliest. I just mention that because the ACT and New South Wales have been operating essentially in parallel, as you'd expect. But certainly, at this point in time, there's been no change. Of course, whenever there is we'll let you know as soon as we possibly can.</span>

                  <a href="HWM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  This government, of course, called the royal commission into aged care. It had more than a dozen reports sitting on its desk, with hundreds and hundreds of recommendations. In the two years since the Prime Minister called that royal commission, we have seen some devastating evidence at that royal commission. We have seen some terrible things. We've seen wounds with ants crawling on them. We've seen residents with malnutrition. We've seen that one in five Australians in residential aged care are receiving substandard care, according to the royal commission's evidence. The evidence can only be described as confronting. Over 10,000 submissions have been received by the royal commission, with expert after expert conveying to the commissioners the bleak picture of a system that is broken and in need of major reform. I want to take the time to thank those witnesses who have bravely come forward, telling harrowing stories about their loved ones and their family members, and those aged-care workers who have come forward to expose some of the broken system. It has been compelling but really distressing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen from the government in response to this royal commission? Over a year ago it got the interim report. It was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. That was a big hint. You get the feeling from that that the system is groaning under the pressure. The very first recommendation of that report was for the government to fix the home-care package waiting list. Here we are. We had 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care over a year ago and, today, we still have over 100,000 Australians waiting for home care. Indeed, senior counsel at the royal commission today said that the government need to do more when it comes to home care; they haven't done enough. There was evidence before the royal commission that, even with all the government's announcements—prior to the budget one—there would only have been 300 actual new home-care packages by 2023. That is despite all of their announcements. What we get from that side is a lot of announcements, but, as we know and as the public is learning, we get very little follow-up and follow-through. We don't actually get what the government announces. We get something else. We get all spin and very little in return. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has taken some action on the other recommendations, but we still haven't seen the results of those. And then, of course, we saw the COVID pandemic come to Australia. What we've seen, sadly, is 680 older Australians lose their lives in residential aged care. It is very tragic. But, when the royal commission sought some evidence about what had happened in residential aged care, sadly we got another example of the Prime Minister not listening to the royal commissioners. We actually had the royal commission go as far as to say that the government had no plan to deal with outbreaks of COVID-19 in residential aged care. We had the royal commission say that the government had been self-congratulatory and, indeed, had shown hubris. That's the government's own royal commission senior counsel saying that about the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember what happened. The Prime Minister was asked at a press conference about some of this. Indeed, the journalist said, 'It's now found that there was no plan for the aged-care sector in the pandemic,' and what was the Prime Minister's response? He said: 'Oh, the royal commission hasn't found that yet. It's not a finding.' But, two months later, the royal commissioners handed down their special report into COVID-19, and there we had, in black and white: 'There was not a COVID-19 plan devoted solely to aged care.' That's what it said. The Prime Minister also responded to another question about the royal commission. Again, another journalist asked him a question in relation to a national advisory body about aged care, and he said, 'Oh, no, that's not a finding yet of the royal commission.' Then what did we get? Again, a couple of months later in the report, we actually have, in black and white, a recommendation that the government establish this advisory body. And of course the government said, 'Yes, we're going to do that now.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that the government is not acting soon enough and quickly enough when it comes to the royal commission's evidence, and sadly we have seen the tragic outcome of that in residential aged care. We've had Professor Murphy admit that perhaps they should have had masks earlier in residential aged care and that that could have prevented some deaths. We've had the aged-care response centres that were set up and we have had some evidence that, indeed, they were preparing for a dinghy, not for a <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>. That's what was said about the aged-care response centres. We've had admissions from the government officials that, if these centres had been set up earlier, if more had been done more quickly, we could have saved lives. That is the devastating evidence that is happening before the royal commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're hearing more evidence about the assaults that are happening in residential aged care. Indeed, the royal commission has heard today that 50 sexual assaults a week are happening in residential aged care. The government said it would introduce a serious incident response to that, and what have we got? We've got the government saying, 'Oh, yes, we can do that from 1 July 2021.' And then, of course, we had the government trying to bring forward some funding for that. It really needs to get on with it. It is not good enough that this government continues not to listen to the royal commissioners when they are making these findings. We've had two reports from the royal commission. We're expecting the final report in February 2021. The sad reality is that the public do not believe the government and, of course, this failed aged-care minister, who, when he was asked, didn't even know how many people had died in residential aged care from COVID. It was absolutely appalling that he didn't know that. They don't have the confidence that this government can actually respond to the recommendations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredible that we've had so much defensiveness from the Prime Minister. He wants to talk about how he called this royal commission; it was all his idea. We all know he was dragged to it. We all know they had those reports, they had the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> episode coming up and they had the Labor Party talk about a royal commission, so they called one. What they actually need to do is listen to it and respond, and respond quickly. It is not good enough that we continue to get this defensiveness. We get announcements, we get all the spin but we get very little real action. That is the reality of what is happening in aged care. Older Australians have had seven years of this government. For the first three years the government just ripped money out of the aged-care system, and we're paying for that now. That is the truth of it. They just ripped money out for the first three years. They've been in government for seven years, and the aged-care system is groaning under the weight of their decisions. They need to accept responsibility for what is happening in aged care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not good enough to continue to have these announcements with very little follow-through coming from this government. When its own royal commission says that the government has shown hubris in relation to COVID-19 we know exactly what's been happening on that side, and the royal commissioners are seeing through it. They're seeing through this government and all of its announcements and they're getting to the truth. They're doing a great job of actually responding to what is a system in need of major reform. We have 1.2 million older Australians—and their families and their loved ones—relying on this system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission today put out a whole heap of draft recommendations—124 of them. We know that there'll be more to come and there will be the final findings. But the government still needs to respond to the COVID report, as I said earlier. There were six recommendations. The government has been asked by the royal commissioners to come into parliament and respond to the implementation of those by 1 December. Those recommendations talk about funding providers to ensure there are adequate staff to deal with visitors to residential aged care, because we know so many older residents have been locked out from seeing their loved ones and are relying on technology for that. They talk about there being more MBS items to allow more allied health services to people living in aged care; about publishing a national aged-care plan for COVID-19 and the national advisory body I spoke about earlier; and, of course, about appointing infection control officers and working with the states and territories on the deployment of accredited infection prevention and control experts. We all know that if all of this had been done sooner, if the government had responded earlier, there would not have been the number of deaths we've seen in residential aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has said that the government must report to the parliament. The government has just 40 days left in which to get this done, to ensure that these staff and these services are implemented by 1 December. I don't think it's up to it, the public don't think it's up to it and the failed minister certainly isn't up to it. The Prime Minister and this government need to do better, because they're failing older Australians. The royal commissioners got it right when they said 'neglect'. The government needs to do better.</span>

The government has accepted all of the recommendations from the first report and accepted all of the recommendations from the second report. Indeed, we responded on the afternoon of 1 October, when the most recent report was related, and accepted all six elements, for the record of the House. It is very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation of the commission, that the government provide a final report by 1 December, we've accepted. That's underway. On the second recommendation, the government has announced two packages to provide additional funding for staffing with regard to visitation for aged care, and we're actually implementing $245 million of funding to support providers with COVID-19 related costs. So full acceptance of the second recommendation is already underway, which the opposition unfortunately is not aware of or didn't acknowledge today. In addition to that, the government accepts the third recommendation, which was in relation to the mental health of residents of aged-care facilities, and we will be implementing that. I've already been engaged deeply in the planning of that with the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and with the department. We are within 19 days of the recommendations being made. The recommendations have been accepted, with four out of the six already having been significantly implemented and all six to be implemented.</span>

                  </a>  In addition to that, in relation to the fifth recommendation, the government has accepted it, as with others, in full. Funding of $245 million is being paid to providers through October 2020—already underway; already being delivered—and that will mandate that aged-care providers have trained infection control officers, as detailed in the recommendation, on top of all of the other elements. Then there's the final recommendation: accepted, in full. And the government has been working with state and territory governments to implement a decision of national cabinet of 21 August to put in place additional face-to-face infection control training and establish joint approaches—already underway. That's very important. So I thank the commissioners for their work today and I look forward to their further work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me look more generally at two things: further actions taken by the government with regard to aged care and further actions taken in relation to COVID preparation. In relation to aged care, I think it is important to set out the facts here. We have come from $13 billion in 2012-13, under the previous government, to, in this budget, $24 billion, $25 billion, $26 billion, $27 billion. Those figures matter. In particular, as part of that, what we've seen is a dramatic increase in home-care places. Home-care places have gone from 60,000 places in the last year under the previous government, and $1.15 billion, to 185,000 places—a tripling of places, this year, under the current government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard them on occasion say, 'Oh, they're just going up in relation to population.' In fact, we've had a 28 per cent increase in over-70s since the previous government was in government; we've had a 200 per cent increase in home-care places, or a tripling, and a 300 per cent increase in home-care funding, or a quadrupling. So funding has grown at 10 times the rate of population of over-70s in that time. That's against their benchmark of their year. If funding had grown in line with population, it would have grown at 28 per cent; instead, funding has grown at 300 per cent, or 10 times, and therefore it has grown at a dramatically faster rate, and we have seen a dramatically higher increase in services per capita than was the case under the previous government. I think that's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should also be noted that, on two occasions in the last year, the alternative government has had the opportunity to make some contribution. They went into the election and they had zero dollars—</span>

This is very important: right now, in this moment, in an alternative budget—and knowing everything that they knew, at a time when we have put in over 70,000 home-care places—they added zero. They found money for other things. They found nothing—zero, nada—for home-care places. And that's twice in a year.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUNT:</span>
                  </a>  Most significantly, what we've seen, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> has shown, is that even though no country is immune, and Australia has had real and significant suffering following the tragedy of community outbreak in Victoria, which translated, sadly, to the loss of life in Victoria, we see that in Italy, the loss of life of elderly residents is 600 per cent of that in Australia per one million population, with regard to care residents. In France, it's 800 per cent. In the USA, it's 900 per cent. In the UK, it's 1,500 per cent of what it is in Australia. In Belgium, it's 1,600 per cent. All of these things are fundamental and show what has happened in Australia by comparison. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> said, our actions have saved 16,000 lives, on their estimate, by comparison with the United Kingdom. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How has that come about? What are the things that have occurred? I think it is important to acknowledge what the commissioner said today: I have, however, detected over the last year, counsel, a growing determination among officials and in the Government to fix the problems of the aged care system and to pursue a genuine reform agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That’s because this was our commission and this is our passion. It’s why this year we’ve invested over $1.6 billion in our COVID aged-care response plan. It began with the first step in January, where we acted immediately in relation to COVID. It moved through the second stage with the plan that was put in place for the national COVID response in February, and then the national aged-care COVID CDNA plan in March, the update that followed in relation to workforce and PPE support across March and April, and the revised national plan and guidelines, through March, Arpil and May. Then, in June, there were the revised national plan and guidelines, again taking on board the lessons learned. These are the things that have allowed Australia to save lives and protect lives. We want to acknowledge the hardship. We want to acknowledge, as we said from the outset, that if there's community transmission on an epidemic scale no-one is immune. But what our aged-care workers, our carers, our health officials and the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre have done is to save lives, to protect lives and to make a difference—as acknowledged by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look around the world at those catastrophic outcomes in other countries, we know that each life lost in Australia has been an agonising loss for the individuals and for the families but that the work of Australia—the government, the states, the individuals involved and, above all else, our carers—has saved lives and protected lives on a grand scale. For that, I thank all involved. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  The current aged-care crisis that we are facing here, particularly in Victoria, has had a huge impact on us all, particularly in my electorate of Wills. I understand that this pandemic is unprecedented and mistakes have been made from all levels of government—state and federal—and from both sides of politics. What I don't understand and what I won't accept—and nor should we accept—is a Prime Minister and a minister for aged care who refuse to hold themselves accountable for their lack of planning and for what they were and still are responsible for. Like many Australians, I'm appalled at the Morrison government's lack of accountability and action in the private aged-care sector, which they are responsible for. There are more than 653 families grieving who deserve to know why their loved ones were not protected and why that planning wasn't put in place. Instead of answering those questions, such as why they ignored the warning signs with the Newmarch House outbreak in New South Wales and failed to act, the Prime Minister and the minister for aged care have chosen to dodge and duck and weave at every turn. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Wills, there are hundreds of families and friends of these families who do not have the same luxury of dodging the reality they face. They cannot simply ignore and push aside their grief—particularly those who had loved ones in the St Basil's aged-care home in my electorate of Wills. I've spoken to many family members. There are around 200 COVID cases linked to St Basil's aged-care facility in Faulkner, and 44 people lost their lives. Once again, I send my deepest condolences to all those grieving families. Behind those numbers there are many, many stories. Most who lost their lives were Greek Australians, migrants who came here to Australia and who worked exceptionally hard. They helped build the Melbourne and the Australia we know today. Many worked in factories or started small businesses. They contributed to their communities and they worked hard to give their children a better life here in Australia, and, after all their hard work and contributions, in the end they were effectively neglected by the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister didn't listen. Indeed, he neglected to listen to the royal commission's interim report. The title should have been an obvious pointer to the Prime Minister; it was <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. The report was published over a year ago. The commissioners recommended that the Morrison government urgently fix the home-care packages waiting list, which was described as cruel, unfair and discriminatory. It was another piece of critical advice ignored by the Prime Minister. If he'd listened and if his aged-care minister had listened and acted, this disaster could have been avoided or at least mitigated. Many families would still have their loved ones to cherish. Instead, they had to say goodbye on FaceTime or not at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that after seeing the disaster develop before their eyes they would react quickly to mitigate the extent of it. But, no, the Prime Minister and the rest of the Morrison government stood still. Commissioner Pagone suggested back in August that the government establish a national body dedicated to dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak in aged care. Did the Prime Minister listen to the commissioner's suggestion? No, he did not. He said it was just a proposal. Two months later, the royal commission's COVID-19 special report confirmed in black and white what we already knew: the Morrison government had no plan for COVID-19 in aged care. The facts are stark. As at August 2020, at the height of the outbreak in Victoria, there were 1,923 COVID cases in private aged-care facilities. There were six cases in public aged-care facilities, which are the responsibility of the state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's inability to plan and prepare is a catastrophic failure. It's a national tragedy. To those families in my community: I'm truly, deeply sorry for your loss. And to the people in my electorate of Wills and all Australians who have lost loved ones in aged care to COVID-19: you deserve better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  Normally in this chamber there is an absolute confluence between what I think and what I say, and I would just say on this occasion I'm going to reserve judgement on the member for Wills and politely caution him that Victorian Labor MPs coming into this chamber, virtually or otherwise, and lecturing this parliament about the measures that have been taken on COVID-19 should do so with extreme caution, because the reality is that this government has worked consistently to support the aged-care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have done everything we can to support people and to make sure that aged-care providers are as well equipped as possible to support those people who are vulnerable and in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a surprise to anybody in this chamber, and I'm sure many of the speakers who follow me will repeat similar points, that when you have community transmission as we have had extensively in the great state of Victoria—and we can argue about why, and there's a judicial inquiry where misleading evidence has been provided by a number of people, including ministers and the chief health officer—it leads to a spread with a latency of the virus, which, tragically, leads to the infection of many people who needn't have been infected. Of course, the virus was latent in particular amongst those who are vulnerable in aged care. We all know people in aged care—my grandmother is in aged care, as I'm sure are the parents or grandparents of many other members—and we have all felt that vulnerability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since March we have had a plan, working with the aged-care sector, to build up their resilience and their capacity. There have been spreads of COVID-19 in aged-care providers in the Goldstein electorate. Like members on the other side of this chamber, I'm sure, I've called those aged-care providers, reached out a hand of support and said, 'Is there anything I can do to connect you to the department, to support, to getting access to the PPE that's desperately needed, to the minister?' Both the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and the Minister for Health have been explicit in their preparedness to support and assist, answer any question and respond as necessary, and they have done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I tell you what I have heard—and I say this with sadness, not with any sense of political glee. The feedback I have got from aged-care providers in the Goldstein constituency is that their problem is not with the federal Department of Health but with the state Department of Health and Human Services. I say that with absolute sadness. It's incredibly frustrating. They have been frustrated because they have found a lack of access to PPE as a consequence of the decisions made by the state government. Not only has that put at risk the lives of those who are clients of aged-care services; it has put at risk those nurses and carers who work in that sector. That's why we have done so much to support them and to fill that gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Comments have been made by the member for Franklin and the member for Wills suggesting that this government has been negligent in its support for aged care over a long period of time. I'm sorry, but that is just misleading this parliament. The minister has just gone through, step by step, the funding that is available to the aged-care sector, a sector that works hard to support those people in need. It actually belittles and demeans the members opposite to belittle and demean the sector of people who, literally every day, give the most support they can to assist people who are at a vulnerable stage of life. Year after year we've had record increases in funding. In fact, from 2012-13 to next financial year, there is an increase of 103.2 per cent in total funding. It's irresponsible to come into this place and argue these cheap political talking points that come from the opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I say that particularly in the context of Victoria. All of us have different opinions about how we can manage this crisis. Yes, sometimes people think some people have done things wrong—and I certainly have very strong views, particularly in the context of the Victorian government. But our focus should be on what we can do to assist, and that is where the Morrison government's focus has been.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>): The discussion this afternoon is about one of the most vulnerable sectors of our community. There have been more than 680 COVID related deaths in residential aged-care facilities but there is no readiness plan for any sort of pandemic. This system has never been stress tested. There has been no plan in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Liberal government's first budget after they came to office in 2013, there was a $1.3 million cut in aged care. That was never returned. They are thinking in the never-never now, but once recommendations are made by the royal commission they'll have to do something. They have been sitting on their hands waiting while, regrettably, 680 people have died. This government has starved the sector of funding, which has resulted in a workforce shortage, underpaid and undertrained employees and a lack of PPE. At the start of the pandemic there was one pair of gloves per day for aged-care workers dealing with people in a vulnerable state—and those opposite say they had a plan! They had responsibilities, and they have been shown to be lacking. And now we see that the sector itself was thoroughly unprepared. From Newmarch onwards, you could see the lack of preparedness in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The health minister will no doubt stick to his line from July this year, which was that the sector is 'eminently prepared'. That's certainly not the evidence coming out of the royal commission today. In fact, that's not in any of the evidence taken by the royal commission. It's seen a litany of stories of things such as malnutrition, starvation and open wounds infested by ants. Even today one in five are being maltreated. This is a national disgrace. And it's not just that there's some corporate responsibility out there. Aged care is the responsibility of the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, you can cut back all the agencies around it. You can cut back regulatory authorities that are supposed to be doing their job. But the thing is that ultimately you cannot give away responsibility. You can't shoulder that somewhere else. This government just will not live up to its responsibility when it comes to aged care. As a matter of fact, I think they thought all their problems in aged care went down the drain of a kerosene bath years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the royal commission did call this right in their interim report: <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. You can't run around it. This is a hand-picked royal commission—by the way, a royal commission they were taken to kicking and screaming. It wasn't their idea. Labor certainly campaigned on this. The community and the sector campaigned. The government were forced into it. But what have they done since? As I say, they want to sit on their hands and wait to see final recommendations. We should be taking steps to ensure that we fix a broken system, to ensure that residents in aged care get the care they need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We would expect that every public dollar going into aged care would find its way into care itself. Only recently I was reading about some big providers making some really big profits in this sector—like $59.9 million profit. One of those organisations was not even providing paid pandemic leave for its workers. These are workers that are surviving on average pay of $23 an hour. No wonder they've got to take extra jobs and work in multiple areas. They're trying to make ends meet. So this is how the providers value care. It's about time we realised this is about the workers who look after our loved ones in a very vulnerable state. This is the value that we put on them for their care. We don't need a royal commission to tell us this is broken. We need to muscle up to our responsibilities and make the changes now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I stand here to remind people in this House of the complexity of the aged-care system. I don't know how many on the other side of the House have been to visit their local aged-care facilities, but I have been to visit almost all of mine in my electorate. I'm sure that those on the other side have as well, because they're very important facilities that as a member of parliament I feel very responsible for.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that the federal government invests heavily in the aged-care sector. It's important also to recognise that, in the international context of the aged-care system, every developed country is dealing with an ageing population. It is something we on this side of the House understand because we know that our ageing population is ageing because our healthcare system is so good. We're ageing in a healthy way and we're living longer. But what this means is that we have a changing aged-care sector. This side of the House is investing very heavily in increasing services to the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important things that we on this side of the House have done is invest in home-care packages. This is something that the public want. We've heard over and over again how people want to stay in their homes longer. They're healthier because of our healthcare system and our excellent preventive health, but they also want to stay home longer. It is something that this government has done a lot on. In fact, we've had a tripling of places for home-care packages from 60,000 when we came to government to 185,000 now. This is something welcomed by my constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the other side of the coin is that, with an ageing population, we are seeing a more rapidly ageing population in aged-care facilities because people are staying home longer. This is actually a good thing and something to be celebrated. But, as a result, the increased pressure to the aged-care facilities and sectors means that the aged-care sector is rapidly changing, and that is why it has been important for there to be a royal commission. In fact, virtually one of the first things Prime Minister Scott Morrison introduced was this royal commission into aged care. As the Minister for Health has just said, it's our commission and it's our passion. That is because we understand how important our senior citizens are to our community. They've worked hard to build our country and they deserve a good end of life as they grow older.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is I believe the other side has been very misleading with regard to the fatalities that have occurred during COVID. Each and every fatality is an enormous tragedy. I know that there are 653 families who are mourning the loss of a loved one from COVID in the aged-care facilities, but it is misleading to say that our response has been insufficient with regard to the COVID pandemic. Let me be very clear about this: there have been as many, if not more, healthcare workers infected with COVID as aged-care workers, and yet we do not hear people saying the healthcare sector is broken. The difference between the two is that older Australian are the ones who are unfortunately at greater risk of fatality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's when COVID gets to a very a high level of community transmission that it gets into these facilities, whether it's aged-care facilities or healthcare facilities. If you really look at the statistics, what's very interesting is that, per capita, Australia's aged-care sector has one of the lowest fatality rates, compared to the UK, Italy and the US. We have a mortality rate 15 times lower that Italy's and 53 times lower than the UK's. That is because we had a very rapid response to the COVID crisis, with a national COVID plan, increased investment in PPE and huge amounts of resources being thrown at the problem to make sure that we could protect our vulnerable citizens. I'm very proud to be part of the Morrison government, which cares and supports our older citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is misleading to say that there hasn't been plan. There has been a plan. You can go on the website and have a look for yourself. And, as the Minister for Health has said, it has been revised many times throughout COVID. I have been on the phone to the CEOs of aged-care facilities in Higgins, and I know that many other members in this chamber have done the same in their own electorates. Australians understand that we care about our aged-care citizens and our aged-care facilities, and I welcome the fact that the royal commission has been looking into this issue. It's more complex than the opposition would like to present.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Ignoring the crisis in aged care is just plain cruel. It's a dereliction of duty. Yes, it is complex, but the job of government is to face complex issues and get the work done on behalf of all Australians. That's what everybody in this chamber has been elected to do. The Morrison government was dragged to the aged-care royal commission, but, to date, those opposite have wasted and ignored the very wisdom and experience they sought to empower. The royal commission's interim report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, was published over a year ago. It's a heartbreaking title, and it gets my attention but apparently not the attention of the Prime Minister or his failed minister for aged care. The commission recommended the Morrison government urgently address the waiting list for home-care packages, a waiting list that was described as cruel, unfair and discriminatory. These are feelings that I fear ring true for 608 elders in Eden-Monaro who are currently on the waiting list. As the COVID pandemic grew, the commission suggested that the government establish a national body directed to deal with the outbreak in aged care. They failed to listen, and heartbreak followed for over 680 families, including my own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, my family farewelled my 91-year-old grandmother, Gladys Hobson. Nanny Hobby had been living with dementia in Victorian care for some time, but her final six months came with extra distress for her and for my family because of the collapse in services on this government's watch. We weren't able to visit, and the regulations that put shareholders before the people they should have been caring for meant that my nan suffered from starvation. Indeed, her aged-care facility had the largest outbreak of COVID outside metropolitan Melbourne. My mum, Kaye, helped to nurse and comfort Nanny Hobby through her final weeks, drawing on her 15-year career as an aged-care worker herself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mum talks about this part of her working life as being a privilege—a privilege to care for, connect with and protect people who have lived lives big and small but who have all made contributions to our community. I know everyone who works in aged care feels the same. I want to honour your service and thank you for what you do. You are the people who day in and day out make the best of this failing system for the people and families in your care. Everybody agrees we need to do better, but those charged with the task simply don't hear the call from the royal commission and indeed every Australian family. We need to put the care of these vulnerable people at the heart of aged-care reform and deliver for people and families, not shareholders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make special mention, too, of young people living in aged-care facilities. We hear your need and so does the royal commission. In its interim report, the commission flagged the need to stop the flow of younger people going into aged care and asked that the process of getting younger people out of aged care be expedited. There is no reason to delay action on this work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate, in Queanbeyan the community presented us with solutions for this, following from Yvonne Cuschieri's own experience of having to put her son into an aged-care facility as he was dealing with a terminal disease and she needed some respite. The Commonwealth and New South Wales governments say they are supporting respite care for Queanbeyan by building a six-bedroom, purpose-built facility for younger people, but as yet there is no funding to support its ongoing operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South of Queanbeyan, in Cooma and Jindabyne, the community is asking for action. The home of Snowy 2.0 needs more aged-care places. Regional people want to grow old in place surrounded by their families and friends and the environment and culture they know and love and that was so central to their younger years. But the choices of these people are limited. These communities are crying out for help, and yet this government doesn't appear to be listening. The foundations of our aged-care system have buckled under the pressure of 2020, and the solutions are there for all to see. Indeed, the solutions are there and can help build on our recovery from COVID-19, because the care economy creates jobs—jobs in Queanbeyan, jobs in Cooma and jobs in Jindabyne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're naturally geared in regional communities to look after each other. Above all, we want dignity and decency. The Prime Minister and his failed aged-care minister must do much more to ensure older Australians are safe and receiving high-quality care. I hope Australians don't have to wait for an Albanese government to be elected next year for— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for her contribution to this debate. I would, however, humbly point out that it's not just members of regional Australia and rural Australia who are geared to care; members of my community care for lots of people in aged care as well. Members representing Australians who live in metropolitan areas care greatly about other members of their communities. That's the thing about the Australian community: regardless of where we may live, regardless of what we might do, we care for each other. It is not simply the reserve of those who live in the bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been said that the great enemy of truth is not the lie, which is deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth: persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. I ask this House to consider whether this MPI does not exactly resemble what that statement warns against. The members for Wills's contribution today was to say that, while there were many deaths in privately owned aged-care facilities in Victoria, there were only six in the state government run aged-care facilities in Victoria. What he failed to mention was that the state government of Victoria does not actually own or operate that many aged-care facilities and that all of those aged-care facilities are in rural and regional areas where there was no community outbreak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's that level of misinformation, that level of myth-making, that level of contrivance in attempting to take the loss of 680 lives in our aged-care facilities and turn it to political advantage that I stand here today to rail against. Shame on those opposite for using the deaths, and the families of those people who suffered due to those deaths, for some political point-scoring. It is absolutely extraordinary that the member for Eden-Monaro would say that this government has ignored the crisis in aged care and that is cruel. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government were given a report by the Productivity Commission, and for four long years Mark Butler, who was otherwise an excellent minister for aged care, sat on that report. Julia Gillard, the then Prime Minister, sat on that report. There was a lack of investment in aged care and there was a lack of capacity built into aged care while the Labor Party dithered, absolutely dithered, in trying to do—what? To do nothing? And it did absolutely nothing, and people suffered. </span>

We have taken action to care for those vulnerable Australians that those opposite talk about all the time but do so little to help. We have this experience—</span>

Many of the aged-care homes resembled Dickensian workhouses, with the overwhelming stench of urine; with four residents stuck in a room; with residents often pressing their buzzers, waiting for someone to come and help. I have seen what the injection of private sector innovation and funds and investment into this sector has done for the lives of these people who have very little time left on this planet. I have seen the innovation in care. I have seen the difference that we have been able to make in this country by opening up this sector. I have seen the damage that government intervention created.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  The members on the other side who have spoken on this matter of public importance have forgotten to mention one major point—one major point—about this whole debate, and that is that in the first few years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government they cut nearly $2 billion out of the aged-care sector—$2 billion. You do not take $2 billion out of a sector and expect it to run better than how it was running. Taking out that $2 billion had a massive impact on this sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't really need a COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the flaws in the aged-care system. We already knew that the aged-care system had problems. They've had problems with training, staffing, funding, transparency, oversight, regulation and safety. That's why we on this side pushed for a royal commission. Those opposite were dragged kicking and screaming to the table. Many times in this House we called for a royal commission into the aged-care area. But, if anyone in Australia was in any doubt about these problems, this pandemic has demonstrated in no uncertain terms that the government has severely come up short in the way that it treats older Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundations of our country's aged-care system have buckled under the pressure of this pandemic. They've absolutely buckled. And the Morrison government have done nothing. They have done nothing to stop it. It's been two years since the royal commission began and we're almost nine months into this pandemic. Following the deaths of 680 older Australians, the government needs to explain why it isn't listening to its own royal commission suggestions. There's been one failure after another by this government. For example, over a year ago, the royal commission published its interim report, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect.</span> This report recommended that the government fix the home-care package backlog, with the commission describing it as 'cruel and unfair'. But have the government fixed it? No, they haven't. They came in here during the budget and threw some numbers around, with a few extra packages. But, when you've got over 100,000 people on the list waiting for an aged-care package and you release a few thousand that will take effect over, I think, three to four years, you are just plugging one hole, and a massively bigger hole is ripping open. There are over 100,000 people waiting. I have had constituents—we all have, and I am sure those on the other side have as well—who have died while waiting to receive their package. I'll give you an example. Ninety-eight-year-old Zofia of Kilburn is still waiting for a package after being assessed over a year ago. She was assessed twice, and she's still waiting. How much longer does this woman have to wait? She is 98. It is absolutely cruel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next the commissioners suggested, in August, that the government establish a national body dedicated to dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak, especially given that aged-care residents make up 75 per cent of all coronavirus deaths. But the Prime Minister chose not to implement that suggestion either. As a result, two months later, the royal commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">Aged care and COVID-19: a special report</span> confirms the government had no plan for COVID-19 in aged care. Aged care is a responsibility of the federal government, not of anyone else. The royal commission's special report confirms that the Morrison government had no plan for COVID-19 in aged care. That is even though, at that stage, we'd already witnessed the devastating effect COVID-19 was having on older people and aged-care residents in New South Wales and in other parts of the world. We aren't just speaking about the direct health implications of the pandemic; we're also talking about the growing levels of depression, anxiety, confusion, loneliness and suicide risk among aged-care residents since the lockdowns, and there is no mention of the lasting effects on family members who had to let their loved ones die alone and couldn't hug them one last time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been consistently calling on the Morrison government to act to address minimum staffing levels, fix home-care waiting lists and ensure transparency in funding, and, I must say, the government has not done the right thing by older Australians and their loved ones. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  This really is an important MPI. Some are just political battles, but this is a really important issue. I have more aged people in my electorate than most members have in three or four electorates, and aged care is a huge part of the Lyne electorate. We had a diatribe coming from several members on the other side, and I want to correct the record, because I deal with the facts, not the emotion and the made-up allegations of some of those who spoke earlier. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, it was Prime Minister Morrison who called the royal commission. There were allegations made that we were dragged kicking and screaming to it. But I just checked the record, and he called it in September 2018, which was after the Leader of the Opposition at that time, the member for Maribyrnong, was asked whether he supported a royal commission into aged care, and his response was, 'Um, as for a royal commission, I don't know.' That was on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> on 11 June. That is the first thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I'd like to bring to the attention of members opposite and people listening is that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> and the Australian Ageing Agenda website state that there have been 1,000 fewer deaths in aged care in this current year than there were for the whole of last year, before the pandemic struck. I looked at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare death figures in aged care in 2012 and 2013 and, in those two years, 245,000 people passed on. In the last couple of years there have been 32,398. There are fewer people dying now, even with the pandemic. As the member for Mackellar said, there has been a rapid increase in the standard of care in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some institutions that have failed. They have failed miserably. That's why we set up the aged-care royal commission, but before that we set up the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. We've increased funding every year since 2013. It was $13 billion annually when I was first elected to this House. It's up to $24 billion now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing they were criticising us for was home-care packages. When they were in government and then left the government benches and we took over the responsibility, there were 60,000 home-care places. Now there are 185,000 funded places. In the last budget we added another 23,000 and we added 6,000 back in July. The number of people waiting for a home-care place has gone down by 20 per cent. These are facts, not allegations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed that when I started pointing out the facts the member for Franklin departed. Even her interjections couldn't drown out the facts. The fact is that there are things that need to be improved in the aged-care system, but we have been doing it. The royal commission's direct responses have all been addressed. There has been action taken on them. I've mentioned the home-care packages. There's the extra funding for dementia training. On the other thing about too many people in aged care being heavily sedated, medication management programs, policies and education programs have been rolled out. Guidelines have been changed. There was also a criticism of there being too many young people in aged care, but the numbers have reduced from 6,000 two years ago to 4,860.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are addressing the problems and correcting them. There are more funds in aged care, because of the COVID response, whether or not we're doing these reforms. The response centre was criticised. The problem of aged-care deaths was because there was a community pandemic and the pandemic came in through the front door, because there was community transmission. That is a public health issue. The aged-care institutions aren't necessarily set up as sterile institutions like hospitals, so it's a real step change when a pandemic rolls through an aged-care system, but look at what has happened oversees. What we have done is exemplary in a very bad situation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  I'll continue my remarks on this legislation. Earlier I was making the point that the Morrison government fails to understand that environmental destruction comes at a huge economic and social cost. Degraded soils, deforestation, polluted and poisoned air and water all add billions of dollars to the health costs of the nation and to the cost of agricultural production in this country, which is one of our main economic drivers. But those costs are quite often hard to quantify and they tend to get pushed to one side when there is an economic proposal put before the government. It seems that will always get precedence over the environmental fallout that might occur as a result of it. A healthy planet means healthy people; it's as simple as that. Most of the people I speak with, certainly in my community, seem to understand that. That's why most of the recycling initiatives that I have seen over the years have come from the local community groups, including environmental activists, local school groups and local governments. I commend each and every one of them for their efforts, and I applaud them for what they continue to do, but simply alone they cannot do enough. We need to do more. We only recycle about 12 per cent of plastics in this country. Australia can and should do a lot better than that. I'm hoping that this legislation might at least begin to see a change in the mindset of the government and the Australian people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  There are many factors that are going to contribute to how successful we will be in rebooting Australian manufacturing. The federal budget outlines the Morrison government's $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, which will grow our national manufacturing sector by getting the economic conditions right for business, making science and technology work for industry, focusing on Australia's areas of advantage and building our national resilience. As we implement this strategy and lift the game on manufacturing, and advanced manufacturing in particular, one of the more understated but important factors for its success is how we protect the intellectual property, or IP, of Australian businesses through good policymaking without stunting innovation, growth and capability. The strong support for manufacturers to become more competitive, scale up and create local jobs reaffirms the need to strengthen these protections now, particularly while trust in Australian made is at a record high. Recent studies found nine per cent of Australians associate the iconic golden kangaroo logo with safe and high-quality products, while 97 per cent can associate it with supporting local jobs. Businesses are responding by capitalising on this groundswell of community support, with monthly applications for the Australian Made licence up 400 per cent since January of this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, Tracy, the managing director of Plustec, in Emu Plains in my electorate of Lindsay, informed me that she's received her Australian Made certification. Plustec are making the type of high-quality product that the Australian Made brand is known for, manufacturing thermal, double-glazed windows and doors that help secure homes and drive down energy costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As consumer demand for Australian-made products increases and more manufacturers like Plustec emerge and expand with the measures implemented in the budget, we must ensure the IP of Australian manufacturers is protected in order to prevent foreign companies undermining the integrity of the Australian Made reputation and eroding trust in our high-quality products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tracy is also a member of my Advanced Manufacturing Taskforce, which I established to address the challenges facing Australian manufacturers and explore opportunities to create more local jobs. The task force is investigating opportunities to leverage our advantages and break down the barriers holding back Australian manufacturers by gathering firsthand accounts of the challenges facing manufacturing. The task force has already shown a glimpse into the challenge of IP theft facing manufacturers in Western Sydney and across Australia. Global data trends support the task force's firsthand account showing that IP theft is significantly on the rise and costs countries hundreds of billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD reports that, in 2016, 3.3 per cent of world trade was in fake goods, up from 2.5 per cent in 2013, and the global cost was around $720 billion. The OECD report found that the highest number of counterfeit shipments being seized were from China, which exported 47 per cent of the fake goods traded worldwide in 2016 at a value of around $340 billion. Of the fake goods traded globally, 35 per cent were in electrical machinery and electronics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with Robert and the team at GPC Electronics in Jamisontown, who are contributing towards the tactical edge servers that will play a key role in the battle space communications capacity of the Army's Boxer Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles. Robert told me how securing this contract would open the door to new opportunities for GPC to contribute to our national defence industry and grow their business. In Lindsay, and across Australia, manufacturers like GPC Electronics are creating advanced products and rely on both their products and their brand to be protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt IP theft is happening here in Australia. You just have to speak with local manufacturers to find out that this is a problem. One manufacturer, Geoff, who's an engineer and makes Australian-made machines using local factories, said that he's had clients have every part of his catalogue reproduced overseas. He said it's heartbreaking to see that local manufacturers are being forced out of business. 'Somebody’s got to fight, before it's too late,' says Geoff. This is why it's so important that we take IP theft seriously in our country. If we're serious about backing our advanced manufacturers, we must be serious about protecting them as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  [by video link] I'm really pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the parliament this afternoon, about, really, the plight of young people across Australia, particularly those who I am lucky to represent in my electorate of Hotham. There is absolutely no doubt that young people have been copping it from every direction during this pandemic. I've been making a lot of efforts recently to speak to young people in my electorate and beyond about what's going on for them, and I want to talk today about some of the highlights that have come out of those conversations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important piece of context, I think, is that young people were not doing so well before the pandemic hit us. If we take housing, for example, young people in Australia on low incomes are about half as likely to own their own home as they were in the 1980s. The labour market is changing in really powerful ways that mean that the jobs that you and I probably used in order to get a foothold in the workforce may not even exist anymore. We know that university is becoming incredibly expensive, and, of course, that's been exacerbated greatly by the decisions the government has made recently about increasing university fees. The mental health of young people is an emerging and crucial issue that this nation has got to confront. Additionally, we're not doing anything about climate change. Just about every young person I talk to raises the issue that we're living in an economy, we come into the parliament every day, we don't make the decisions that need to be made about fixing the climate and yet this is a problem that they are going to be left with. The overarching point is that young people today are tackling challenges that you and I and everyone else who's a bit older in the parliament didn't have to deal with when they were younger, and we do need to give them a bit of extra care and attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to provide good representation to the young people I represent, I recently ran a survey across thousands of young people who live in my electorate, and I wanted to speak to the parliament to share some of the results. It's probably not going to be a surprise that, for the young people I surveyed, by far the biggest anxiety facing them at the moment is to do with work and income. We know that young people were more likely to be working in jobs that were affected by the COVID shutdowns, much more likely to be in casual work and, hence, to have missed out on JobKeeper—about 40 per cent of the young people I polled said that this was by far the most important issue. One of the respondents to the survey said to me: 'COVID-19 showed how insecure and unstable my job really is.' The survey also told me that this is not a short-term concern—that a lot of the young people I represent today are worried not just about their current income but about what the COVID recession, the Morrison recession, will mean for their long-term economic future. About 60 per cent of respondents cited career prospects and income as a big concern. One said to me: 'The lack of job security and career opportunities available to graduates made me feel very stressed and uncertain.' Another said, 'I'm finding it really frustrating just not being able to properly prepare for the future.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health was another issue that came out very strongly. One respondent said to me: 'I was stood down and brought back to work within 24 hours. The lack of job security and career opportunities made me feel really stressed.' Another said, 'I'm constantly full of dread and anxiety that I will have to go to work and bring the virus home one day and infect my family.' One of the things I really learned from speaking with young people who responded to this survey is that I think a lot of the criticism that's been directed at young people during the COVID pandemic has been incredibly unfair. The young people that I talk to are incredibly anxious about the virus. They're anxious about the older people in their lives, and they're doing everything they can to try to make sure that they don't spread this virus through their own activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental health is a major issue for young people. We've got a lot of young people whose lives have effectively been put on hold in profound and dramatic ways. As a consequence, on average, the young people who participated in my survey rated their mental health as 2.5 out of five.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got into politics to try to make things better for the next generation. I really want us all to remember that as we think about how we confront what comes out of the COVID-19 period. The next generation is not some kind of academic concept. They're alive and they're here today. They're in their teens and 20s and early 30s. They're really doing it tough out there. It's going to be very important for us, rebuilding out of COVID, to listen to what they're saying. If I can leave the parliament with one message, something that comes out of all the conversations that I have with young people, it's that they don't feel sufficiently involved in the deliberations that we have in this chamber. If I can leave MPs with a request, it is: please get out there and talk to the young people that you represent, and let's have a better conversation in this parliament about how we can support them coming out of the pandemic.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Today the Prime Minister echoed those four very sweet words: 'How good is Queensland?' There are words, however, that you never hear. Nobody has ever said, 'How good is the Queensland state Labor government?' I've never heard that in my life—for good reason, because, when you look at infrastructure in particular, the Labor state government groans under the weight of their own ineptitude. When the Palaszczuk government came to office in Queensland, they inherited a situation where the Queensland government, the former LNP government, had been spending twice as much on infrastructure as New South Wales and Victoria—twice as much. Over the first five years of the Palaszczuk government, they have reversed that trend. It's been New South Wales and Victoria who have been spending twice as much as Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These statistics are based on an independent analysis done by the federal Parliamentary Budget Office. It tells an horrific story. It tells the story of a completely incompetent Queensland Labor government, a government that that has already missed an opportunity. If the Palaszczuk government had even just delivered on the LNP's infrastructure plan, they would have spent an extra $12.7 billion by the end of June 2018, let alone if they had kept ahead of New South Wales and Victoria. At the same level, it would have been tens of billions of dollars more on Queensland infrastructure than that. But they did not. The Queensland state Labor government failed, and they failed the people of Queensland. We're talking billions here, not millions. We are talking about multiple dams, roads and rail. We are talking about thousands and thousands of jobs that Queenslanders have missed out on because the state Labor government has fallen short of their investments in infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Budget Office could only do an analysis on data available up until June 2019. So I looked at the state Labor government's own figures for the year ending June 2020. Between December last year and June this year—only seven months—the state Labor government in Queensland fell short of their own infrastructure commitment by $1.3 billion. So, here we are, facing an economic crisis probably as large as we've seen since the Great Depression. The state in Australia that you read about in the newspapers nearly every day is Victoria, due to the lockdown and the problems with their economy as a result. But if you look at the unemployment statistics of only last week, it is Queensland that has the highest unemployment rate in Australia today. This is an absolute disgrace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor were to win the next state election in Queensland, the state from which I hail, we'll be looking at a lost decade—10 long years of suffering under an incompetent Labor government that fails Queensland and fails to spend. It risks making Queensland the rust belt of this country, which is why it's so vitally important we have the LNP in Queensland. The federal government will continue to do its job. The federal Parliamentary Budget Office proved that the federal government, this coalition government, contributes about twice as much to Queensland in infrastructure in this funding split than to other states and territories. This state election is vitally important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  [by video link] Today I want to speak about the Morrison government's treatment of Victoria. The Prime Minister urged Australians in all other states to offer 'an elbow of support' to us Victorians. 'If you've got friends in Victoria, call them,' he said. 'Cheer them up, encourage them. We have to help them push through, because the future depends on the months ahead.' At first it was an elbow, but now it seems to be a salute from another part of the body. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve weeks later, and we have the Prime Minister putting politics before people, and he knows it. He knows that Victorians are in the middle of a tough time and that times are going to get tougher—because of the actions of this Prime Minister, because he's putting politics before people, before families. The Prime Minister and other ministers have said that, on average, a thousand Victorian jobs have been lost each day of the lockdown. Victoria is working hard to protect its people from a pandemic, putting people first. There have been hard times, and we all acknowledge that. Parts of the economy have stalled while we deal with this menace. While Victoria is working hard to protect its people, in comes the Prime Minister, playing politics. He's cutting support in Victoria, even though we're the hardest hit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker are going to hit Victorians the hardest. More than a million Victorians have had their JobKeeper payments cut by $300 a fortnight whilst they remain in lockdown. This isn't an elbow of encouragement; it's more like an elbow to the guts. Treasury has forecast that more Victorians will be on JobKeeper in December than all other states combined. Thousands of Victorians are expected to lose their jobs and be forced onto JobSeeker payment, which the government has also cut. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a flow-on effect of putting politics first. It's not just these one million Victorians who will be affected. With less money to spend on food, clothes and other essentials, a whole range of Victorian industries and business are going to be cut off at the knees as they try to recover, because people won't have the capacity to spend that they did. This is going to push more and more people onto the dole queue. Australia's economy is trying to get through a recession that this government created, and the government wants people to stop spending. That is not going to help. It's only going to hurt Australian families and Australian businesses. Businesses understand the impacts of the Morrison government's decision in the Morrison recession. The latest ABS figures show small businesses reacting to the JobKeeper cuts. Payroll numbers have dropped 2.7 per cent in firms with fewer than 20 employees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Victorians don't just have to deal with these immediate cuts by the government. There's more pain ahead because, in the budget, the government put politics before people as well. You only have to look at the lack of infrastructure spending. Victoria is home to 26 per cent of the nation but gets only 15 per cent of the infrastructure spending. The two promises that were made at the last federal election have never been delivered. People need to know why New South Wales is getting 36 per cent, while Victorians miss out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was widely acknowledged when the budget came out that the government had forgotten to do anything for women. Victorian women have been hardest hit by COVID-19, finding themselves out of work at a greater rate than men, yet the government couldn't find room for women in the budget. The budget will rack up a trillion dollars of debt, but it still doesn't do anything to create jobs, it fails to build for the future and it leaves too many behind, especially women and older Australians. It's one trillion dollars of debt but millions of Australians left behind, including some 928,000 people over the age of 35 on unemployment benefits who have been deliberately excluded from government support and the hiring subsidy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, the government knows that older Australians are being disadvantaged by the budget and by the cuts. They know. The Parliamentary Budget Office's own figures showed that the typical JobSeeker recipient now is an older person, rather than a younger man. The government's decision to cut support for older jobseekers, pitting them against younger jobseekers, is having the outcome that it seems the government wanted. Older Australians feel like they've been consigned to the scrap heap by this government. JobSeeker has effectively become a de facto pre-age pension. And where are the Victorian Centrelink staff to support the people forced onto welfare? The Morrison government has cut them too—420 Victorians given the elbow and added to the Morrison casualties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />If the government need an example of how to put people first, they could learn a thing or two from local community groups in the seat of McEwen, who have come together to help people affected by the pandemic. Love in Action, a community group in Wallan and Mickleham, and the Dal Baba Sikh organisation are vital social movements in our region that form partnerships to lend a hand. They truly are  community-based grassroots movements which have created meaningful linkages for people in our community. These values are so important to us, to our community and to our nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  Before I came to this place, and after having concluded my first career in the Australian Army, I worked in business as a crisis management consultant. Some friends of mine joked, when I was about to take up the role in the place: 'Vince, it will be handy to be able to deal with a crisis when you get into parliament!' I'm pleased to report that some of the principles which underpin effective crisis management have absolutely been on display by the Morrison government throughout the pandemic thus far. Anyone who's been associated with managing incidents in a formal setting, whether it be in fire brigades, ambulance services, policing or other frontline emergency services, will have become familiar with the term 'PPRR'. This stands for 'preparedness, prevention, response and recovery'. Let me touch on some of those principles and how they relate to the current response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, prevention: unfortunately in Australia, as with the rest of the world, we have not been able to succeed in becoming completely COVID free. However, there were some very early precautions which our government put in place—changes like stopping travel, initially from China, then from Italy and later from other places around the world. That made a massive difference in helping prevent the situation becoming a lot worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once we've sought to prevent, we still need to maintain preparedness, and we saw some activity here as well. There was a massive ramp-up in personal protective equipment. There were investments, not just from the Commonwealth but from the states and territories as well, in our hospital systems—the people and the infrastructure that needed to be ready in case things got a lot worse. We were also very well served by the fact that we had the first balanced budget in 11 years. That got us off to a good start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next letter, R, is for 'respond', and we've seen, throughout, a response on a number of fronts, certainly in the health space but also economically. I don't know how many people in my electorate of Stirling have said this, but I've also heard it replicated among my colleagues in this place and in the Senate—businesses have felt such appreciation for the JobKeeper supplement and for the fact that it's now being extended. It really has been an economic lifeline. But that doesn't stand alone, and nor do we stand alone here in Australia, so we've put a great deal of focus on making sure that our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific are also being well resourced in terms of their own response and recovery, and that has lined up nicely with our Pacific step-up program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response has taken a number of other forms as well. One of the things I'm really pleased to see, knowing that young people have been very hard hit—in fact, people under 35 are four times more likely to either lose their job or have significantly reduced hours as a result of COVID. This is where we've seen the JobMaker hiring credit come into play. It's a fantastic incentive for businesses to reach out and hire some of those younger people and help set them up for the future. We've also invested in manufacturing—in being able to continually improve some of the manufacturing that occurs in Australia. I'm pleased to have seen support in the latest budget for critical minerals as well. This is a fantastic asset for Australia and a resource that we can exploit even further, ideally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note, though, that government is not the sole solution to every problem, and certainly that is true with COVID as well. I'm encouraged to see a lot of community response locally, at a volunteer level, and to see private businesses, who have been well supported by this government, stepping up themselves. I have a couple of examples. One of my constituents, Tony Brooks, is involved with a company called SysteMedic, along with Rowan Fenn, Walter Purio and others, and these guys are using proven blockchain technology to help enable international travel in a COVID-safe way. Another example is Alcolizer. For those who have ever been pulled over and breath-tested: the guys who produce many of those units are now, with government support, moving into the space of COVID testing. They received $180,000 initially to support their own investment in testing kits and, more recently, another $150,000. They're doing well, and we're right behind them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak tonight to thank the frontline workers who have given so much to the community of the electorate of Fraser during the pandemic. Thank you to the incredibly talented and dedicated health workers right across Melbourne's west. I acknowledge the GPs, nurses and allied health staff across Fraser who are making sure that our primary health system continues to serve the community. Many have worked tirelessly at testing centres helping to identify the location of the virus and restrict its spread. I thank the extraordinary team at Western Health, including those at the Sunshine Hospital and the Joan Kirner Women's and Children's Hospital. The healthcare workers in Melbourne's west have made telehealth function smoothly and enabled outstanding patient care. They've worked often in cumbersome PPE and have needed to isolate from work and family at short notice, sometimes for long periods. Nineteen new research studies into COVID are already up and running at Western Health, with many more to come. These will add to our understanding of this disease and our ability to confront it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank our essential retail workers, who have been on the front line every day throughout this pandemic. Unfortunately, this has been often at a cost to themselves. Even before this pandemic, 85 per cent of retail and fast-food workers reported experiencing abuse while they were at work. This included swearing, yelling, spitting and threatening behaviour. This is obviously a small minority of customers, but it's still very confronting for retail workers at the best of times. There's no excuse for the increasing amount of physical and verbal abuse that has been experienced by retail workers during this pandemic. No-one deserves a serve at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also just observe that the difficult conditions experienced by retail workers have been compounded by the cuts to their pay and conditions that have been inflicted on them by this government. In the middle of this pandemic, retail workers' weekend pay was cut again. For years the government and its special interest groups have claimed that slashing retail workers' wages and those of workers in related industries, such as hospitality, would magically create more jobs. After three years of cuts to wages and conditions, not a single extra job had been created before COVID struck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by making observations about the budget more generally and its impact on the workforce. This budget has left too many people behind, particularly those worst affected by this recession. In the 1920s it was said that there is 'a tendency in many armies to spend the peacetime studying how to fight the last war'. Well, this government is fighting recessions of times gone by, imagining that the economy is exactly as it was decades ago. As the Grattan Institute said recently, in a piece titled 'High-viz, narrow vision':</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison government seems to think economic stimulus is all about high-viz vests and hard hats. It's a narrow and dated view of the world of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also a misreading of the current recession. Of course we support measures that have been put in place to support construction and related industries, but there have been too many sectors of this economy left behind, particularly sectors in which women are the predominant employees. Women were already faring badly before COVID. In Melbourne's west, the underutilisation rate of women was nearly 20 per cent in 2019. That's one in five women who couldn't find a job or get enough hours, and that was before COVID. Across Australia, female youth underutilisation had risen to 30 per cent by 2019. We all know that the worst-hit industries during this recession are typically female dominated: retail, hospitality, the arts and many parts of education and training. This is a services recession, and it needs a vision broad enough to cater for a recovery that includes key services sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, this budget is lazy. It is based on a premise of a static economy. It assumes that today's economy is the same as that of previous recessions. It isn't. It assumes that the right strategy is to return the economy to where it was before the recession. It isn't. Worst of all, it assumes that there's no place for reform; that it's okay to take on a trillion dollars in debt with nothing to show for it—no reform of child care, no energy policy and no vision. That's the biggest gap of all, and it's a deficit that this country can't afford.</span>

          <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
            <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the importance of the Auditor-General, who is responsible for auditing Commonwealth entities and reporting to the Parliament, providing crucial accountability and transparency regarding Government administration, and scrutiny of the expenditure of public monies;</span>

            <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the ANAO's budget has been in structural deficit for years because of this Government's cuts, recording unsustainable operating losses of $3.1 million in 2018-19 and $4.8 million in 2019‑20;</span>

          <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <span class="HPS-Small">(a) immediately reverse its cuts to the ANAO's budget and provide the Auditor-General with the funds he has requested, by having the Minister for Finance provide an immediate advance, and making a commitment to boost funding over the forward estimates in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook;</span>

          <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
            <span class="HPS-Small">(b) apologise for the Prime Minister's failure to protect and support the independent Auditor‑General, as the Prime Minister has proven that he cannot be trusted to protect the integrity of the office;</span>

          <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
            <span class="HPS-Small">(c) consider introducing legislation to remove the ANAO from the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio and establish the ANAO as a parliamentary department, cementing the Auditor‑General as a truly independent officer of the Parliament; and</span>

          <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MADELEINE KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Last month I was pleased to host the inaugural Brand Community Lecture Series in partnership with Murdoch University on their campus in Rockingham. I initiated this lecture series to enable the local community to hear from scientists and experts in their field on topics of interest to the community—important issues such as COVID-19. The inaugural Brand Community Lecture Series lecture was titled 'Understanding the immediate and long-term medical effects of COVID-19'. It was presented by inaugural guest speaker Professor Jeremy Nicholson, an internationally renowned scientist and the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Health Sciences at Murdoch University in WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Nicholson leads the Australian National Phenome Centre, an important centre of research and the only facility of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. The phenome centre is a core platform in the Western Australian Health Translation Network. While led by Murdoch uni, it is a remarkable example of scientific collaboration that brings together all the Western Australian universities, major hospitals, medical research institutes and centres, including the Telethon Kids Institute, the Harry Perkins institute and the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth. The research emanating from the Australian National Phenome Centre will revolutionise the diagnosis and treatment of the most serious health challenges of our time, including COVID-19, cancer, obesity, autism and type 2 diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were really lucky to have Professor Nicholson share his research and his thoughts on the current global pandemic. While only 40 people could attend the lecture in person, to ensure social distancing measures were observed, it was a sellout, and over 150 people tuned in to the lecture over the live stream. While it's not a happy topic to discuss, it was very evident that many people found the information from the professor interesting, forthright and clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Facts matter, and we must listen to the science. Entirely contrary to science are the bizarre conspiracy theories about the virus which have been allowed to flourish, where some extreme politicians and celebrities openly promote potentially harmful treatments for the disease by cherrypicking research and seeking to make their rudimentary investigations somehow the equivalent of decades of scientific research and practice. We were really lucky to hear from Professor Nicholson and to hear about the science that he has engaged in over decades and his personal experience of the disease that he himself contracted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be more in this lecture series—of course there will. The next one will be on Thursday 5 November, entitled, 'Of microbes, mice and men'. Special guest speaker Professor Elaine Holmes will be discussing the importance of our gut bacteria in health and disease. Please get in contact with my office in Rockingham if you'd like to come along.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I am speaking about the hard work and dedication of aged-care facilities in my electorate of Chisholm. The COVID pandemic has been incredibly tough on all Australians, but those that have felt it the most are our aged-care workers. Facilities like Burwood Terrace, led by Sherman Brown, are working tirelessly to protect the most vulnerable in our community. They need our trust and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can we all take a moment to reflect on how tough these organisations must be doing it right now. I want all aged-care providers in my electorate of Chisholm to know that I am here for them and the coalition government is here for them. I regularly visit aged-care facilities in Chisholm. I love hearing the stories that residents share. Of course I have not had the chance to visit recently, but, as soon as it is safe, I will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will always back these crucial frontline workers. The Morrison government has given $1.5 billion in support for senior Australians in aged care. Initial payments, like the $205 million COVID-19 support payment that was provided to all residential aged-care providers in June, are having an immediate impact. I'm so glad to see a further $245 million injected into all facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The support this government has provided has assisted in enhanced infection control capabilities. The support this government provides is saving lives. We are also making sure that older Australians who temporarily need to relocate from aged care are supported too. An additional $71.4 million has been injected into the Commonwealth Home Support Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, let me tell the House about Lisa Perry from Waverley Valley Aged Care in Glen Waverley. We spoke about the shortcomings of COVID testing in Victoria. Sadly, she was told she wasn't a priority, even though she manages two aged-care facilities. Her passion and dedication to aged care is commendable. I really enjoyed our conversation and her sharing with me the vital work that they do for our senior Australians. Unlike Labor, aged care is always a priority for this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Last weekend I received an email from Marjorie, an 81-year-old woman living in my community of Ballarat. Marjorie has been a reader of the Ballarat <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span> as long as she can remember. If ever she is spending a night or a weekend away from home, Marjorie has her neighbours hold onto her copy of the paper so that when she returns home she can catch up on all the local news she missed while she was away. She tells me her daughter does the same. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the Ballarat <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span>, Marjorie reads the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballarat Times </span>and watches the local Nine and WIN television news. She consumes as much local news as she can get. In Ballarat Marjorie is not alone. We all love our local news and understand how important it is in our community and across regional Australia. Regional local journalists tell our stories. They examine and inform us about our communities. They report on issues that might not get the attention of the metro papers but that make a real difference in our lives. Ballarat news outlets are an essential service, reporting on important issues in my community, such as the royal commission into institutional sexual abuse and local politics right the way through to national stories and local sport and community events. Much of the community has a story about the time when they were in the local paper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, local news outlets and news outlets more generally have been facing repeated cuts, whether they be commercial outlets or the ABC. Ballarat has had its losses, but I know that Ballarat and the smaller towns that make up my electorate are largely still lucky to have a range of locally based news. Despite the survival in Ballarat of our major outlets, our region has faced repeated job losses for journalists, other news staff, camera crew, photographers and admin staff. Most recently, with the closure of ACM printing in Ballarat, there were over 100 jobs lost in my community. I fear that these job losses will not be the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Media is essential to our democracy. It is essential in our regional communities. We have seen regulation and legislative changes that have actually diminished our local voices, not increased our local voices. The Save Our Voices campaign is incredibly important. I encourage everybody in my community and the regional communities beyond to engage with that. The decisions this government has been making about ownership and content in terms of local news and local stories are diminishing our democracy and diminishing the capacity of regional communities to have their voices heard and to tell their stories. The government needs to immediately look at how it can restore the integrity of our media market and ensure the voices of regional communities are heard.</span>

However, students, staff, former staff and the community have been deeply concerned about CSU's future. They're concerned about the veracity of the figures that have been published by CSU surrounding deficits, which, to be clear, started last year, well before COVID. They are asking about the long-term staff that are being let go and further rounds of redundancies. They're asking about CSU's reserves and also its financial controls. The public rightfully expects these issues to be dealt with in an open and transparent way. It's taxpayers' money at stake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in the central west and beyond, I've been trying to get answers about these matters. That's why earlier this year I called for an independent external audit to ensure community confidence and government trust in the university's finances. Following my calls, on 5 June 2020, CSU's council passed resolution CNL143/1, agreeing to a fully independent and external audit into its financial performance. This was commendable. The council also agreed to provide the report to the Australian and New South Wales governments. I was advised the resolution passed with an overwhelming majority. Yet, despite the council's agreement to undertake an independent and external audit, both the vice-chancellor and the council have declined to honour the resolution to provide the report. Simply put, this situation is unsatisfactory and contradicts the express undertakings in the resolution. As of today, the report remains hidden from the communities CSU serves. It's a secret report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined earlier, many citizens in Calare and beyond are concerned about CSU's financial integrity. I share those concerns, as CSU's chancellor has flagged with me in my office a litany of systemic issues that required investigation, including CSU not being able to account for the number of vehicles in its fleet; time sheets for overtime that had been submitted up to 12 months after work had been purportedly carried out; alleged and/or apparent fraud; and possible referrals to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption of individuals who were not identified to me or my staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that students, staff and the communities which CSU serves are provided with a full, open and transparent audit, to assure taxpayers and the Australian government about the future of the university. We need to ensure appropriate levels of accountability and governance are in place, especially in the face of further planned redundancies. More than anyone, I want to see CSU thrive and prosper, and that's why I, along with all the country universities, supported the Job-ready Graduates Package. Now is the time for CSU to act. It's time to live up to its commitments by providing the report and giving the communities which CSU serves confidence about its future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Labor is the party of the social safety net, but it's also the party of prosperity, nobody left behind and nobody held back. Australia is a wealthy nation, and there is no reason why people can't have access to good health care, quality education, a roof over their head and a job to go to as well. This is a core belief of Labor. Good economic policy is good social policy and vice versa. They are two sides of the same coin, not distinct and separate areas of work. In my community, there is some wonderful work going on to support those who need it most. I've stood in this place before to discuss some of those programs, and there are more initiatives now underway that I'd like to draw to the attention of the House. Research tells us that the most important time in a child's development is the first 1,000 days from conception, and we're obliged to provide every support from that time onwards, especially to new families. In my community, we have child and parent centres in two of our local primary schools. They are run by Parkerville. These are hubs that provide high-quality, approachable and accessible services for the whole family. Importantly, these facilities are safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families like those in my community often find it difficult approaching formal support services. They can be intimidating to those who need to access what they have to provide. But these wonderful services that are based at Westfield Park and Brookman primary schools in the electorate of Burt are headed by fantastic teams and are excellent hubs of support and guidance. Many people are overwhelmed when they become parents, and these facilities provide a friendly way to access support and resources for new and struggling parents and families. They allow for early intervention to take place, to make sure that there's a connection to services that are required and that children and families are receiving the developmental support and education that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the first cohort of students who started with this program graduated from Westfield Park Primary School, and I'm told that their academic and developmental results were noticeably improved. That's why I'm so happy to see these services made available in my community and would like to see them expanded throughout more schools, to be more available to more people in our community. One of the great benefits that can come from the expansion of these services is building a critical mass of benefit across our entire community, making sure that our entire community is lifted through these supports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there are many in our community who need to have a more interventionist approach provided to them. That's why I've also met recently with Hope Community Services, who provide assistance services for those leaving juvenile detention. I met with a number of elders that advised that service. We went out on country to talk about how their services can be better tailored to make sure those leaving detention are better supported on re-entry to our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Experts say that the pink butterfly doesn't exist. Well, it did on Friday at Pink Up Penrith. It was precious and special, just like the amazing community spirit we are fortunate to have in our community of Lindsay. The butterfly was on display to fundraise for Pink Up Penrith and the McGrath Foundation breast care nurses at the Nepean Hospital. This year's theme is passion, pride, Penrith. The McGrath Foundation selected Penrith as the first LGA to lead this fantastic cause. I often say that in Lindsay we are full to the brim and overflowing with community spirit, and we know that Penrith will again band together to raise much-needed funds for local breast care nurses, who help so many families affected by breast cancer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years, the Penrith community has supported this fantastic initiative. Because of our community, two breast care nurses have been appointed at Nepean Hospital to help those who are diagnosed with breast cancer and their families through this journey. There are 151 McGrath breast care nurses in Australia, and since 2005 they have supported over 90,000 families. For many women, going through breast cancer can be a lonely and isolating process, and they do endure a lot. But these women are strong and have the love and support of family, friends and the breast care nurses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across our community, local businesses like Nepean News, Complete Recruitment Solutions and Poles Patisserie as well as community groups, schools and families have come together to raise money for Pink Up Penrith. It was wonderful to join our community on Friday at the Regatta Centre and see the beautiful butterfly on display. The floral backdrop provided the opportunity for many people to come together for photos, and I was really proud to take my mum, Rhonda, and sister, Karen, along too. The Orchard Hills Men's Shed created this butterfly, along with talented local artists and business owners from across Penrith and St Marys. It was absolutely beautiful, and it was developed because the Men's Shed during the coronavirus was under difficult circumstances and wanted to do something for the community. Linda Kemp and Elizabeth Smith sponsored the butterfly and painted it with Maralyn Kastel from the Nepean Art Society as well as Naomi Stevenson from Green Magic Homes and local artist Jane Paul. This beautiful butterfly is all about the spirit of community. We've seen the best of our community and the strength and resilience of our community spirit throughout the challenges of the bushfires and the flooding earlier in the year and now the coronavirus pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from Linda Kemp at this event, whose determination and perseverance saw her defeat breast cancer, and we celebrated that together. Pink Up Penrith has raised over $96,000. It was a special time to share the day with our community, and I thank everyone who made it possible, particularly Gai Hawthorn and the Penrith CBD Corporation for putting the event together and contributing so much to our community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  In my first year in parliament, I convened a roundtable of student leaders from schools in my electorate. I've done it every year. It makes me feel old when I tell the House that this is my 10th student roundtable. It's an opportunity to hear directly from those who may not have a vote but who do have a voice so that that voice can be heard here in parliament. Like so much of 2020, this year we did it by Zoom. I had the privilege of hearing from students from 12 schools, including from St Joseph, amity, chevalier, Kanahooka, Albion Park, Corpus Christi, Dapto, Oak Flats, Illawarra sports, Lake Illawarra and Bowral. I endeavoured to hear as much about students' experience of COVID-19 as possible—the positive and the negative. Many described the year as challenging, as stressful. One group of students described it as 'cancelled'. They all had their own stories of what it was like to live and study through this most difficult year. I was struck by their optimism and hope for the future. We need to wrap ourselves around that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked them to focus on a couple of issues, and almost unanimously they identified mental health as something that warranted further attention. An overarching issue was the need for more support for students. Some identified the issue of the curriculum and wanting more focus in the PDHPE subject on mental health. Others identified the issue of the ratio of school counsellors within high schools, and that being the most appropriate location for many of them to access mental health support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Students also wanted governments and members of this place to understand how year 12 students had fared through this most difficult year. Many students pointed to issues with the amount of work being issued to them—sometimes too little, sometimes not enough, often too late. They also wanted to stress the importance of social isolation and how so many of them learnt through regular peer-to-peer contact with each other and how they missed that during the period of lockdown. It was suggested that more options needed to be put in place to support these students in the years ahead. For those students who are doing year 12, we need to smooth a pathway for further study, further skill development or the way into the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also some positive issues that were identified that they want further action on, which I'll speak more about in other debates when I find the opportunity in this place. One concerned NDIS access for autistic students in mainstream schools. Another issue was access to sanitary products for young women in schools. I'll have more to say about these issues in later debates.</span>

There are myriad suggestions about how we'd go about that, but it should be undertaken. Most likely it would be undertaken in the form of a corporate entity, very similar to how the Snowy Mountains scheme worked, and most likely would be over a number of years—maybe 40 years. Nonetheless, it's a project that should be started. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">People of incredible competence, such as Sir Leo Hielscher and Sir Frank Moore have approached it saying that the government needn't put any money towards it, that they have the capacity—because of the current rates of interest and the financing by people who would utilise it—to do it. But the government would have to give the authority and do the constitutionality issues to stand behind it. I want to mention some of the champions of this. Obviously, Sir Leo Hielscher and Sir Frank Moore and Senator Susan McDonald. Senator Susan McDonald is one who walks these people into your office. Senator Susan McDonald is the person who has been following this for such long period of time. Senator Susan McDonald, as a competent chartered accountant and a person who's run a multimillion dollar business, Super Butcher in Brisbane, is a person who would understand business and she should be taken seriously. One of the key things to look at is the Burdekin, which goes down from behind Tully and then heads back to the sea, sweeping up all the water at Ayr. There are other dams and rivers that could be used—the Barron, the Burdekin, Daintree, Herbert, Johnstone, Mulgrave, Pioneer, Proserpine and Tully. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's one issue that we should address and address immediately. It was brought to my attention at Senate estimates and it's also been brought to the attention of Senator Susan McDonald and others, such as Senator Matt Canavan, some time ago. The North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority, which has oversight over the construction of such things as Hells Gate, is based in Canberra. They have one part-timer in Townsville. This is not an established department. It should be based in North Queensland. Being based in North Queensland would give it the capacity to keep the politics of North Queensland on side and to be based on the ground where this issue is most pertinent. I believe that this is an issue that can be addressed almost immediately. I might say that, if people in the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority don't want to live in North Queensland, they are possibly in the wrong job. We have a great record of decentralisation in the National Party—and it continues to be a policy. This is a part of that policy which should be addressed immediately.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  It's often said COVID-19 doesn't discriminate—but it does—or that we're all in this together, when we're not. COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on young people, particularly those living in regional and remote Australia. The GFC saw young Australians struggle to get a start as they finished school or graduated from TAFE or left university. Their struggles grew the further they lived from a big city and with the many setbacks that have held them back across their working lives. We cannot afford to lose an entire generation of young Australians to this virus and this recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, youth unemployment was above the national average before COVID-19. Now there are 20 jobseekers for every vacancy on the coast, making it even tougher for young people to get a job or keep their businesses afloat. Young people like Joshua Maxwell, founder and artistic director of Jopuka Productions, who was recently recognised as the Coast's 2020 Volunteer of the Year. As Josh says, 'Jopuka gives opportunities to young people—opportunities that dried up because of the pandemic.' He went on to say, 'Jopuka has suffered a $100,000 loss and wasn't eligible for JobKeeper. What funding was available was only enough to pay the rent. As a result, 20 young people based on the coast lost their jobs and 12 projects were lost.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the very real economic and social impacts of this virus, and the known link between financial security and mental health crisis is putting young people's health at risk. That is why next Tuesday 27 October, in Mental Health Month, I'll be co-hosting a youth mental health forum with Liesl Tesch, state member for Gosford, and Tara Moriarty, New South Wales shadow minister for mental health. We'll be hearing from locals who've been on the frontline of this crisis themselves and supporting others, like Yerin and the Peninsula Community Centre, and from national organisations such as ReachOut and Kids Helpline. The event is being held at ARAFMI house on the Central Coast. Safe places like ARAFMI offer vital support to young people on the coast, yet at the height of the pandemic they were told they would lose their funding for the youth carer program by the state Liberal government. Young people can't afford to lose any more support at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says improving the mental health and wellbeing of Australians, particularly young people, is a priority of the government, and I believe him. And young people in my community need this government to back up their words with actions. Yesterday was headspace Day. On 15 May 2019, four days before the election, the Liberal Party announced $1.5 million for the establishment of headspace Wyong. On 22 August, Minister for Health Greg Hunt posted on his Facebook about this commitment. In the 17 months since, headspace Wyong has still not been delivered. I wrote to the minister last year about this commitment, and he assured me there would be funding in the 2020-21 budget. He said, 'The Hunter New England and Central Coast PHN will receive funding in 2020-21 to establish headspace Wyong, with services to commence in 2021-22.' This is urgent. Young people in my community need the support now. I call on the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health to act now to deliver headspace Wyong.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  Many Armenian Australians live in and around my electorate of Bradfield on Sydney's North Shore and of course in the Deputy Speaker's electorate of North Sydney. In fact, there are around 50,000 Armenians living in Australia, and 40,000 of those live across Bradfield, Bennelong and North Sydney. Armenian Australians have made an enormous contribution to Australian life and are prominent in many areas of commerce, trade and politics. I welcome the fact that the modern Armenia is a vibrant democracy, having come through a challenging period of transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak today about events in Nagorno-Karabakh, where hundreds of thousands of Armenians live. In the early 1920s, Stalin placed Nagorno-Karabakh under Azerbaijani rule, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union created a vacuum for conflict to escalate in the late 1980s and early 1990s. There was a war from 1988 to 1994, and in 1991 Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh declared themselves an independent state. A ceasefire was reached in 1994, but that has sadly not eliminated hostilities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is mediating efforts to negotiate a full settlement, and the Australian government supports those efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 September, fighting broke out between Armenian Azerbaijani forces along the line of contact in Nagorno-Karabakh. Since then, fighting has increased in severity, despite a temporary ceasefire between 10 and 13 October. Already hundreds have been killed and many more displaced from their homes. With no sign of the situation improving, this is an exceptionally concerning situation, and there is the very worrying scenario of the ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh. The prospect of hundreds of thousands of people being forced from their homes and traditional lands is shocking. I fervently trust and hope that outcome does not materialise. I call on parties to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh to return to the OSCE Minsk Group peace process and respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement of 10 October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the extraordinary contribution made to Australia by Armenian Australians in my electorate and in many other parts of Australia. I note the important work of Mr Haig Kayserian, Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of Australia. I commend the Armenian National Committee for its efforts to raise in Australia awareness of this extremely troubling conflict. I join with them and with all who are calling for all parties to return to the OSCE Minsk Group peace process and to respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement. It is very important that this hostility not continue. It's very important that stability be returned.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  It was about this time of the year in 2015 that I travelled to the United Kingdom on a research trip where I was looking at the motivations and the mobilisers of terrorism. I went on this research trip specifically to speak to former terrorist operatives, and I stress the word 'former'. It was around this time of year that I met a fellow by the name of Sean O'Callaghan. In the 1970s, Sean O'Callaghan was just a teenager when he joined the ranks of the IRA and became a fairly senior operative in part of the conflict in Northern Ireland. By the time he turned 20, Sean O'Callaghan was already an experienced terrorist. But, in November 1988, Sean O'Callaghan walked into a police station at Tunbridge Wells and handed himself in, confessing to his involvement in the murder of a Special Branch detective inspector in Northern Ireland in 1974. He pleaded guilty to a whole range of charges and, for his part in the IRA conflict, he was sentenced to 539 years—a pretty big sentence. Sean only served eight of those 539 years. He was granted a royal prerogative. The reason that he was handed this royal prerogative is that, before handing himself in, he had spent around 14 years as an undercover informant with the Garda, the Irish police force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I went to the UK, I wanted to meet with Sean O'Callaghan. He had had several death threats and evaded attempts on his life by the IRA when his role as an informant came out. I was told that I had 15 minutes with him. I met him in a public cafe in Soho. Those 15 minutes turned into five hours, sitting there, drinking coffee and talking with a man who had spent a good part of his teenage years as a high-level terrorist operative involved in a very well-known conflict. When I first approached Sean, he looked me up and down and said, 'You're an academic.' I said, 'Yes; I am.' He said, 'I suppose you want to know why I joined the IRA and why I left the IRA?' I looked at him and I said, 'No, Mr O'Callaghan, I don't want to know that, because I've read your book.' He had written a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Informer</span>, which was on <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> bestseller list, by the way. He said, 'Well, why are you here and why do you want to meet me?' and I said, 'Because I want to know why it is that you do what you do now,' because for the last 10 years of his life, Sean O'Callaghan had devoted all his time to working with young violent offenders—getting them off the streets, getting them into employment and getting them onto a positive pathway of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, Sean and I sat there for five hours, and in the middle of all this Sean turned to me and said, 'You know, Anne'—because he was Irish—'life is just a series of negotiations, isn't it?' I looked at him and said, 'What do you mean by that, Sean—life is just a series of negotiations?' and he said: 'Well, you get up in the morning, you decide whether you're going to get in there, have a shower, get out there, go to work—do something positive—or whether you're going to stay in bed, whether you're going to drink, whether you're going to watch TV. You make choices. That's what life is. Life is about choices.' Then he said to me, 'But what if you never had a choice, or what if you never felt like you had a choice?' He said, 'It's not rocket science. All you need to do for these kids'—because he was talking about the young people that he worked with—'is give them a choice, give them an opportunity.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That phrase, 'Life is just a series of negotiations', has stuck with me, and not just in my personal life. You know those days, when you're all frustrated and you'd just like to sit there? I just go: 'Life is just a series of negotiations, Anne. Life is just a series of negotiations.' It stuck with me, and not just for its personal relevance. It became the underlying philosophy for my charitable work and for the charity that I set up, working with young people: the idea that, if there's somebody who doesn't feel like they have an opportunity, if you show them that they do have choices, that they do have opportunities, and you guide them into making the right choice, you can change their lives—and not just their lives but the lives of their families, the lives of their community and ultimately the lives of an entire society, for the betterment of our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I would say that that phrase, 'Life is just a series of negotiations', drives what I do here today. When I think of that phrase and I hear the Prime Minister say the phrase, 'Those who have a go get a go', it makes me think about what Sean O'Callaghan said. Yesterday in question time, our Prime Minister said: 'If you're good at your job, you'll get a job.' I'm not so sure that they were ill-chosen words said in the heat of a debate. I think they speak to a much deeper underlying philosophy, and I have to say that I don't think it hits the mark. I think it's a very different philosophy to the philosophy that Sean O'Callaghan was imparting to me when he said, 'Life is just a series of negotiations'—the point that he was trying to get across—because who gets to have a go? Who? How do we decide who gets to have a go, who gets our help and who gets to benefit from the policies of government? Shouldn't our policies, the settings that drive our economy—the settings that we have to grow jobs and develop the economy, particularly in the post-COVID era that we're hopefully moving into—benefit everyone? What if you're good at your job but you still can't get a job? What if you're good at your job but your job was ripped away from you, like it was for the thousands of university workers, tutors, lecturers and admin staff who have lost their jobs? I know many of those people. I worked with them. I know they're good at their jobs. I know they have a go. But they're not getting a go. What about the travel agents and the small-business owners who have lost their livelihoods? Do they deserve a go? I think they've had a go. I think they're good at their jobs. Do they deserve our help? Do they deserve to get a go? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sean O'Callaghan passed away in 2017. I have to say that. No doubt the eight years that he spent in prison took a toll on his health. But he did some incredible work in the last two decades of his life, where he helped young people move into a positive future and gave them a chance at a positive future. I could have only hoped to emulate part of what he did in my own work with my charitable organisation, giving young people opportunities to get into work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm here now in a position, as we all are, to put into practice those words, to put into practice the idea that life is just a series of negotiations, to put into practice that philosophy—that if you give people choice, if you give them opportunity, if you show them that there is opportunity and you guide them to those opportunities, then they have a better chance of contributing positively to our society, whether it's social participation or economic participation through a job or volunteering. Many of the young people who worked with me started out as volunteers for my organisation. One of them, who started out as a volunteer for my organisation, now works for the World Economic Forum in Geneva. He has met the Queen. I haven't even met the Queen. </span>

                    </a>  I have met a queen, but I haven't met the Queen! This was a young fellow who came to Australia as a Somali refugee at the age of five. I am very proud of the work that he did with my organisation and of the young man—he's just turned 28—that he's become. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity today to reflect on the words of Sean O'Callaghan. My husband, who works in law enforcement and security, was extremely worried that I was going to meet a former terrorist who still had death threats and who was still under the watchful gaze of the IRA. He made me promise that I would call him as soon as the meeting was done. I remember walking back to my hotel in London that evening and calling my husband and gushing about the five hours that I had spent with Sean O'Callaghan. My husband, who was a former police officer, reminded me that this man had actually killed police and that he was a former terrorist. But I have met a lot of people who were terrorist operatives in their lives. All of them had turned their lives around in some way. All of them have said the same thing to me. All of them have spoken about opportunity. All of them have spoken about choice. All of them have spoken about this idea that if people feel that they don't have a choice and don't have an opportunity, then they turn their lives in negative ways. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last three minutes or so of my contribution today I want to come back to the budget and to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. The wage subsidies are something which Labor called for and which I commended the government on providing during this—I hate the word 'unprecedented', but here it comes—unprecedented time. I commend the government for providing these, but I would urge the government to think of those words. I know the member for Moncrieff, I know the member for Goldstein, and I know that both of them personally have a commitment—I know that you do you, Deputy Speaker Zimmerman; you all have a commitment—to providing opportunities for young people. I know you believe in that underlying philosophy that life is just a series of negotiations. I've had conversations with you, so I know. I truly believe that most of the people here are here for the right reasons. So I urge us all to think about those questions that I posed earlier. Who gets to have a go? We have an incredible opportunity here to ensure that everybody gets to have a go, to ensure that the people who most need it get to have a vision of their lives where there is an opportunity to do good and to contribute. We have that power right here, right now. Let's not squander that. Let's stay true to that philosophy of helping those who need it the most, of providing opportunity, of providing vision, of giving people hope—because that's what we all want.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. It's been a long time coming! I am now negotiating the terms of grandmotherhood—but anybody who knows me knows there is no such thing as negotiation! Yesterday my son got engaged, and it was a particularly proud moment for me because I was a single mum. I know that all of us here who have children, stepchildren or young people in our lives in some capacity might have a lot of differences, but the thing that we have in common is that we want the next generation to have it better than we did. We want our kids to have an easier life than we did. We want them to have a better education. We want them to have more opportunities. We don't want them to face the hardships that we had to face. That's why we're here: to make it better for them, and the next generation, and the generation after that—for everyone's children. You will meet somebody who you think you will have nothing in common with, but, I guarantee you, if you sit there and you start talking to them about kids, about the future, about opportunity, you'll find something in common and you will form that bond that makes us all human.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the appropriation bills. I thank the member for Cowan for that contribution. I do indeed agree with her three key points. Life is of course a series of negotiations, and life is about opportunities and grabbing those opportunities when they are put in front of you. I myself, coming from three generations of factory workers in South Australia—in Elizabeth West, one of the most disadvantaged areas of South Australia—understand, as the member for Cowan does, about taking those opportunities with both hands to propel yourself forward through education. I know you've educated yourself, Member for Cowan, as I have throughout my life—to make sure that I took those opportunities, as you did as a young person. We find ourselves here on opposite sides of the chamber but agreeing on many of the points that you raised—including that one on choice, which is a very good one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is delivering opportunities for Australians through the 2020-21 budget. I will go through some of them now, remembering that the government delivered 1.5 million jobs before the coronavirus hit, that we had 30 years of consecutive growth in this country and that the government brought the budget back to balance for the first time in 11 years. I think we're in a pretty good position, and that's why we have been able to deliver so much for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget delivers many measures worthy of mention. They provide support to the central Gold Coast and, indeed, to all Australians. The health and wellbeing of the good people of Moncrieff has of course been front of mind during this pandemic. The Morrison government is delivering a world-class health system. This year's record $93.8 billion in health funding has continued our government's strong record on health investment. Over five years the government is investing $134 billion in public hospitals through the 2020-25 National Health Reform Agreement with all states and territories—a 30 per cent increase on the previous five years. Affordable access to medicines is being approved for all Australians through a $376 million measure in this budget for new and amended listings on the PBS. Those in Moncrieff suffering from conditions such as leukaemia, melanoma and Parkinson's disease will benefit. Since October 2013 there have been over 2,400 new and amended listings on the PBS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frontline mental health services, including suicide prevention, will be some of the many services delivered through the government's $5.7 billion investment in mental health and wellbeing. In Moncrieff the 10 additional psychology sessions available through Medicare are already making a big difference to Gold Coasters. I note that, because of the extra 10 psychology consultations, students and staff at Southport State School have been able to have a psychologist visit the school two days a week to help young people with their mental health challenges and to counsel their families. This has all been made possible through the extra 10 free consultations that this government has delivered to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in medical research, with the certainty of a 10-year plan, supports research for lifesaving innovations and jobs, which are so important now. The Medical Research Future Fund has reached its target balance of $20 billion. That's quite significant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is simplifying private health insurance and addressing affordability and access. The age limit for dependants is being increased from 24 to 31. There will be no age limit for those with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care improvements include $1.6 billion for 23,000 additional home-care packages. The $29.8 million funding increase for the Serious Incident Response Scheme will help to address problems in aged care for older Australians. The $11.3 million provided will connect young people living in residential aged care—the youth the member for Cowan was talking about—to age-appropriate accommodation, which is good news. The government is making a $91.6 million workforce investment as it develops its alternative aged-care funding tool, the Australian National Aged Care Classification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in Moncrieff with a disability and their families will be supported through the Morrison government's guaranteed support for the NDIS. Over 400,000 people across our nation are benefiting from the NDIS. It is being guided by my Gold Coast colleague Minister Robert and supported by the government with a further $3.9 billion. That's half what Gold Coast tourism is worth per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our veterans will be provided with better support through the budget. This includes $94.3 million to improve mental health outcomes for older veterans. There is $7.4 million for the Coordinated Veterans' Care Program and Open Arms counselling services. In Moncrieff I have about 3,000 veterans who will benefit from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $17.7 million of funding over four years for the establishment of the Joint Transition Authority in Defence to support ADF members and their families with transition to civilian life. I've mentioned that I have three RSLs in Moncrieff—Nerang, Southport and Surfers Paradise. There is continued promotion of the skills of ADF personnel to employers, with $6 million for the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program. That includes rewards for businesses with initiatives that support veteran employment. We're doing lots for veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moncrieff students, parents and schools know that our government shares their values on the importance of education, as I talked about before. There is record funding for schools. The budget education measures include $310 billion in total recurrent funding from 2020 to 2030 from the government. There is $146 million for better educational outcomes that will benefit disadvantaged students. These are big numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is support for the Smith Family's Let's Count program, which helps 120,000 children between the ages of three and five to improve their numeracy skills—very important life skills. There is a $453 million investment in preschool education to extend the National Partnership Agreement on Universal Access to Early Childhood Education till the end of next year, 2021. This year the government will pay approximately $9 billion in means-tested childcare subsidy payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The JobTrainer Fund will provide the skills for jobs and recovery. By investing $299 million the government will create 12,000 undergraduate Commonwealth supported places by 2021. Fifty thousand higher education short courses will be funded with a $252 million measure. Around 340,000 additional free or low-fee training places will be provided through the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund. Also $18 billion of funding for all higher education institutions, including Griffith University, has been guaranteed by the government in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation reforms for Australia's compulsory system are important for the retirement incomes of 16 million Australians. Around $3 trillion in retirement savings is managed by industry, and some Australians have been let down by the superannuation industry, including through $30 billion worth of fees, which are high by international standards. The government's Your Future, Your Super package will continue the reform of the superannuation system. This will be important for the good people of Moncrieff, to maximise their retirement savings as we go forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is continuing to keep the people of Moncrieff, and all Australians, safe through measures such as the $202 million for the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy, $1.7 billion for cybersecurity uplift, $300 million additional funding for the AFP, and bringing forward $1 billion worth of projects to support the Australian defence industry and the wider economy. The Morrison government's $270 billion investment over 10 years delivers on a commitment to invest two per cent of our GDP in defence budget. This is a floor, not a ceiling. The government's commitment contrasts radically with Labor's neglect of the ADF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Morrison government has been cushioning the blow and rebuilding our economy, the Queensland state government's harshly lingering border restrictions have meant that the Gold Coast is one of Australia's hardest-hit local economies, and Surfers Paradise has been whacked for a six. Our much-loved $5 billion tourism industry, population growth, small business, education and construction have historically been what holds us up on the Gold Coast and what drives our growth. In Moncrieff, the pandemic's economic blow has been cushioned by federal government support. One-third, or 10,400, of the small businesses in Moncrieff have been on JobKeeper. Close to 7,700 small and medium businesses in Moncrieff have received the cash flow boost payments. I met last night, on a Zoom call, with those travel agents who are having difficulty at the moment, who tell me that they've been able to access that cash flow boost and JobKeeper has been the only thing keeping them going. I continue to work with them with their plight. In Moncrieff the coronavirus supplement, added to JobSeeker, has assisted 14,374 people, giving them extra support at the height of the crisis. Over 21,500 age pensioners and carers received $750 in April and again in July. They will receive $250 in December and another $250 in March next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional measures include almost $95 million across the country for exhibiting zoos and aquariums. Sea World in my electorate received some of that funding. It costs $1,000 a week to feed a dolphin, and the federal government has been doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="282981" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms BELL:</span>
                    </a>  Yes. We have a number of dolphins at Sea World. It costs $1,000 a week to feed Sunny at Sea World. Indeed it does. Also, the koalas at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary have been fed by the federal government funding, which is great. There's been $400 million for the movie industry on the Gold Coast. Of course, Movie World will benefit greatly from that, as will many of our kids who are actors. They might be able to come home and act at Movie World, which is really good news. The $10 million for regional tourism that the Gold Coast has received also will help to hold us up on the Gold Coast while we fight through this terrible economic downturn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 federal budget looks to the future. It looks to our plan, it looks to our hope and it looks to our confidence. It looks to protect and create livelihoods and jobs. Our government knows that you out there can manage your own money. We know that. You don't need us to tell you what to do. Around 77,800 taxpayers in Moncrieff will keep an extra $2,745. There are a lot of numbers coming out here, but that means that there will be an extra $200 million that will go into the economy in Moncrieff alone. Multiply that by the three federal Gold Coast coastal seats and that's about $600 million that will go into the local economy over the next year, which is fantastic news for Gold Coasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that eight out of 10 jobs come from the private sector, and that's why I convened the City Heart Taskforce in May and the Reimagine Gold Coast forum, to bring together industry heads to re-engineer a pathway forward for jobs for Gold Coasters. Since then, the Morrison government has announced a $1.5 billion investment over four years for our modern manufacturing strategy called Make it Happen. That was designed by Minister Karen Andrews, the member for McPherson, also a Gold Coast colleague.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the border restrictions and the Queensland government's unwillingness to cooperate with the national cabinet to agree on the definition of a hotspot, our historic Christmas trade for small business and tourism operators has now been devastated. The damage for the 2020-21 season has been done for tens of thousands in tourism, hospitality and associated jobs. It's time to turn our local focus to manufacturing as a leading key pillar on the Gold Coast. The manufacturing already on the Gold Coast is actually worth $7 billion, and 14,000 direct jobs, so certainly it's time to start looking at that and talking about that. We have a big range of manufacturers. Just a couple that I'll mention are Simone and James Emery from Emery Industries. They live in my electorate, and they produce stainless steel medical equipment; it is fantastic that they have manufacturing capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to skip forward a little bit because I only have a minute left. I just want to finish by saying that, in Queensland, the lack of regard for individuals is at the core of the Premier's harsh border decisions. Labor's 'minister for Twitter', Steven Miles, is fond of 'you were wrong and we were right' in his tweets on state border issues. But he misses the point that matters on most borders, and that's lockdowns and that's jobs. Jobs are the future. It's about trust. This Queensland election is about trust—trust to track and trace. It has been a dynamic environment, and even the best decisions change. As we move through the COVID-19 pandemic, state premiers must keep up with those changes. Australians trust our Prime Minister because of his consistent values and because he accepts accountability. He can be relied upon to be the voice of reason and the voice of fairness, and he listens. Queenslanders need to ask this question; they need to ask who they can trust to manage the economy and to manage jobs. They need to ask who they can trust to run Queensland for the next four years, and who will listen to their concerns. Do you trust Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Now, I also said on that occasion that it will be some time before we know the answer to that question—before we know whether the way the money was spent maximises economic stimulus, maximises job retention and creation, and maximises our opportunity to give a helping hand to those who are most adversely affected. I fear today that we might not have to wait as long as I thought we might. I think we can all already see signs of cracks appearing in the budget strategy. Economic commentators everywhere are talking about the economic inefficiency of the spend. For example, I think it was Ross Gittins who said investment in social housing would have given more stimulus, alongside a long-lasting impact on our infrastructure and, indeed, on some of our poorer communities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that the precipitous withdrawal of JobKeeper was probably unwise. I suspect the government has left the opportunity open to address that. Let's hope it does, because it's very clear that the economy hasn't yet sunk to its lowest depths, that things will get worse, and people will need ongoing assistance. I'm very disappointed in the decision to allow only those 35 years of age and under to benefit from the so-called JobMaker scheme. It makes no sense to me. We know, because commentators have reacted and responded to this constraint by analysing who have been most hurt, that the reality is that those who have been most hurt are our older Australians, many of whom are still of working age. It makes no sense to target only those under 35 years of age. This is an issue that the government really needs to revisit and consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic commentators and social commentators also expressed concern that the government hasn't adequately addressed the issues in aged care in all of our communities. I doubt there's a member of this place that doesn't have issues in aged care in the community. We have wonderful aged-care providers. Quality aged-care providers still dominate the sector. Unfortunately, there are a few for-profit providers who haven't lived up to the expectations. But none of them can perform without the resourcing they need from government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm old enough to hark back to the good old days when the state governments ran nursing homes full of nurses and other health professionals, cleaning staff and all the people you need to make a nursing home a hygienic place, a professionally-run place and a place which can serve both the medical and social needs of residents. It's a big black mark on our society that we have allowed those standards to decline over time in the name of fiscal constraint. Moreover, it's a great shame that we didn't take this opportunity, in this pandemic and this economic crisis, to address that. I say to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: it is not too late. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was my 25th budget—though I'm reluctant to say that because it might suggest that I'm a little bit older than I look. Of course, every budget is different. Every budget night I have sat through has been an interesting budget night, but there's basically a similar process and there are similar outcomes in terms of their political environment. I was here for all of the John Howard era. Of course, John Howard benefited from the hard-won reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments and, save for a shaky period during the early part of their term, which was the Asian financial crisis, John Howard and Peter Costello had a pretty easy ride. The global economy was strong. They had rivers of income into the government coffers. They were able to deliver tax cuts, for example, as a consequence and bank some money away for rainy days. So they had it pretty easy. The next budget delivered outside the bounds of normality, as I might describe it, was the 2009 budget, where a Labor government, of course, was dealing with all the consequences of the global financial crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, budgets—now more than ever—are not much of a statement of government policy. They are certainly a statement of government intention in terms of the revenue it intends to raise and the money it intends to spend. The budget remains a very, very important document and budget night remains an important occasion. Both of those things send important signals to the market and provide a level of transparency to the market and our communities collectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As hard as Prime Ministers and Treasurers and indeed the media try, budget nights aren't the time when the government's political narrative for the year and the years ahead are set. Long gone are the days when the 'Cigs are up! Beer's up!' headline was raised the day after the budget, in the days before the indexation of excise. All the big issues now tend to happen outside the budget cycle. Of course, the budget itself is pre-empted by enormous leaks ahead of the big occasion, and both the markets and the community know well in advance where the government is heading. I'd like to talk about that political narrative and the way in which it happens outside of the budget process—although arguably the 2014 budget was an exception to the rule because the aggressive fiscal brutality that marked it had a long-lasting impact, and it was, in my view, probably the beginning of the end of the Abbott government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big three enduring divisive political disrupters in my more than 24 years were, in my view, the arrival of asylum seekers by boat, the former Labor government's climate change policies, and the Howard government's Work Choices legislation. Each of those had immediate but also enduring impacts. Of course, there were plenty of other big events and policies along the way, but none had the enduring and divisive impacts of the three I've identified. Work Choices might be the less obvious of the three in terms of its enduring effect, but John Howard's overreach has been a lasting brake on the anti-worker obsessions of the Liberal and National parties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrival of the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> in August 2001 was an invitation to the Howard government to harness and unleash a latent xenophobia in our communities and, in some pockets of our nation, a level of racism that left me shocked and disillusioned. I feel no ill will towards any citizen who left me feeling disappointed at that time or, indeed, in later times, but I do remain angry that an Australian government was prepared and willing, in the earliest days of the 21st century, when we should have been more enlightened, to deploy the politics of fear and to work so hard to divide our communities for its own political gain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> is not so enduring in and of itself, but the demons that the government's response unleashed are, and they impact on the dynamic of this place still—every day. It gave a voice to a darker side of our society, and it has worked more than once in political terms for the Liberal and National parties. The dog whistle is now embedded in the modus operandi of the coalition parties, and it manifests itself in a range of political and policy strategies to this day. The contemporary example, of course, is the Morrison government's approach to our relationship with China, our largest and most important trading partner, where it is putting its quest for domestic and political advantage ahead of the national interest. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the three big disrupters, climate change trumps them all. History will treat badly all those who have sought political advantage by exploiting the opportunity created by those who have taken seriously our responsibility to act on climate change. By the way, I count John Howard amongst the political victims. His belated 2007 commitment to an emissions trading scheme was seen for what it was: a belated, last-ditch effort to right the wrong. But the electorate saw through it. Tony Abbott made a carbon tax scare campaign the centrepiece of his 2013 election strategy—successfully so, sadly. He was so successful that he was able to claim a mandate to repeal the Gillard government's Clean Energy Act 2011. That was one of the most irresponsible actions I've seen in this parliament. I think Tony Abbott could have been much better than that. If the Gillard government's architecture had still been in place, the carbon price would be very low and our economy would be operating at the same strength it would have been without it. Our jobs situation would be the same, but our carbon emissions would be lower. As to the GST, no-one would even know it was there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John Howard introduced the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target probably more than two decades ago. It was, if you like, our first carbon tax—modest, but our first constraint on carbon in the market. Two decades on, we are still without a market mechanism designed to put downward pressure on greenhouse gas emissions. We should reflect on that: two decades on from when John Howard first put a market based mechanism in place, we are still without one, and our carbon growth is basically flatlining. In other words, it's going nowhere near meeting the obligations we gave ourselves when Malcolm Turnbull signed the Paris Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current Prime Minister thinks he can fulfil our commitments to Paris without a market based mechanism. He certainly hasn't always thought that, because the government certainly had a few goes—three goes, in fact. There was the clean energy target and so on in recent years, but he now says he can make it. I hope he can. Like the budget, it won't be the most economically efficient way of getting there, but, if he can get there, that would be a good thing. My problem is: he's not on par to getting there. In this place, we need to put the politics of carbon and climate change behind us and work together to do our bit and meet our responsibilities with the commitments we made at Paris. We need to do our bit as a small player and make our contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Of course, we need to do it in a responsible and sensible way, but we'll only do it successfully if we put the politics behind us and work together to deliver what both the local community and the international community expects of us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I rise to strongly support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021, and cognate bills, as delivered by the Treasurer in the last sitting week. I start my contribution by firstly noting what occurred before the budget was handed down a few weeks ago, because this budget has to be remembered in the context of the significant economic challenges and the significant economic response that was announced by the government, going way back to March this year. Of course, we all know we were meant to have the budget handed down in May. No-one could have predicted at the start of the year that, far from handing down a budget in May, it would occur in October and it would be in the circumstances where, effectively, the entirety of the budget was about responding to the greatest health challenge and economic challenge that we have faced as a nation since the Second World War. It was back in March that the government recognised the need to put a floor under the uncertainty in the economy because of the health decisions that needed to be made to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and the risk of losing control of it in our community, which would not only put our health system under enormous pressure and potentially take it to breaking point but, obviously, as we've seen in other parts of the world, there are other terrible consequences to that. So the economy was, in many ways, shut down. We had to say to businesses: 'We, as your government, are telling you that you can't trade for the foreseeable future. We, as your government, are saying, in the interests of protecting us all, you can't go about earning your livelihood as you would ordinarily expect to.' That required an enormous government response to ensure that the uncertainty and risk didn't manifest itself in a complete collapse of consumption in our economy and a whole range of other decisions by people in that environment of uncertainty, which would have sucked us into a deep and depressive vortex. It would certainly have taken this country's economy into a deeper recession and probably a depression.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, of course, we had significant announcements in March. In particular, there was the JobKeeper program, the wage subsidy program, which said to businesses: 'Look, don't lay off your employees. Don't disconnect yourself from your staff because you, quite reasonably, don't know how you'll be able to pay them going forward. The easiest thing for you to do, if we don't help you, is to say to your staff, "I have to lay you off," and then put them onto the unemployment queue.' So the JobKeeper payment was central to keeping a connection between employers and employees. It said to businesses: 'We will pick up the salaries and wages of your staff for the next six months. Keep them engaged with your business. Where they can still come and work, they can and should. If they can't, so be it, but keep them on the payroll and keep that connection in place.' I think that will go down as one of the most prescient policy decisions that could have been made in the face of the challenges that we had thrust upon us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many other important decisions made back in March, particularly the coronavirus supplement payment on the JobSeeker side of things. Despite the JobKeeper program, there was inevitably going to be an increase in unemployment. There was inevitably going to be an increase in people needing government assistance. But, much more importantly than that, people coming from a position of economic security into a position of economic insecurity make decisions that not only affect themselves and their families but potentially have a much wider impact on the economy. If you own a home and you've got a mortgage and you lose your job, you get very nervous about that. You think: 'I don't know what my future is. I don't know what my future income earning capability might be. I don't know when I will get a job again and what my salary might be.' And you start to make decisions that contribute to contracting the economy. Whether it be JobKeeper or JobSeeker or the other payments that were put in place—the $750 payments to people on other government support packages—this was a way of putting support under consumption in the economy, ensuring that people didn't make drastic contractual decisions in their own personal family budgets that would have had a flow-on negative multiplier effect more broadly on the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to say that we didn't still have contraction. We did, of course. Unfortunately, this year we've had the first recession in my adult lifetime. No-one enjoys seeing people lose their jobs, seeing people under financial pressure and all the other associated impacts of that. But I speak with a great deal of confidence that, were it not for the measures and the policies that we pursued leading up to this budget, we would have been approaching this budget from a significantly deteriorated position not just as a nation but as individuals, families, businesses and communities. So I commend the government, which I'm proud to be a member of, for what we did in the lead-up to the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget builds on those measures and the policies. More importantly, this budget is about rebuilding on them. They were the foundation that limited the economic impact, the potential economic carnage, and now this budget is about rebuilding—regrowing our economy, rebuilding jobs, creating hope for the future again for so many people. Despite the fact that it is a significant amount of expenditure and it's not the natural inclination of Liberal governments to deliver deficit budgets, this one was absolutely necessary, and I'm very strongly supportive of the decisions that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the cabinet have made, which, yes, do include an enormous deficit this year. It's a necessary deficit, and I see this as an investment: an investment in rebuilding our economy and an investment in creating jobs—getting jobs back for the people who have lost them and creating new jobs into the future for not only our existing workforce but those that will be coming into the workforce in the years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also see this budget as one that is really about empowering the private sector to create jobs and saying to the business community, saying to those sitting in the boardrooms, saying to those making decisions about the future of their business: 'We want to incentivise you. We want to back you to be positive, to have confidence to make decisions.' And some of the key measures in this budget are all about that. The instant asset write-off is a great example. It says: 'You can invest in eligible assets, in plant and equipment, in things that can expand and grow your business and write that off immediately, write that right down from whatever its value is to zero in this tax year if you want to.' This is something that isn't ordinarily available to businesses. We've had, with a much lower threshold of course, the instant asset write-off in previous years. This one is completely uncapped for eligible assets as long as your turnover is under $5 billion a year, which is, I can tell you, the vast majority of businesses in this country and the sorts of businesses we want to be focusing on and helping. That opportunity means that when managers and executives in the decision-making processes of their business are thinking about whether or not they should make an investment in plant and equipment, that's a massive incentive to say: 'Yes, let's do it. Let's invest in expanding or modernising the capability of our business. We get an enormous benefit if we do it under this current policy setting.' In doing so, that's not only going to provide the tax benefit to the business, it's clearly going to grow business, and when you grow businesses you create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax clawback measure equally is a fantastic cash flow injection to businesses. Of course, until this budget, if a business made a tax loss in the current year, if in the future they proceed to be profitable they can offset that loss against future tax liabilities they might have in the future when they're profitable. This effectively reverses that principle and says, 'If you made a profit last year but you've made a loss this year, we will let you offset this year's loss on the tax you paid on last year's profit.' Given that that tax would have already been paid in many circumstances, that's going to see major refunds coming into businesses, money they didn't think they were going to have until this measure was announced. That of course means, when a business has got cash, a business hopefully will spend it. It's an excellent initiative that gives people confidence in the here and now to make decisions rather than think, 'I'll just wait and see and possibly make new investment decisions in my business when I've got more confidence from a cash point of view into the future.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wage subsidy for young people—this has been debated quite a bit, and there are some with different views on the efficacy of it. I really see this as something that is critical to ensuring that we don't engender long-term unemployment for young people in this country who might have lost their jobs because of the COVID pandemic. Certainly the lessons of previous recessions have always been that young people in particular probably lose their job very quickly when there's a recession, when times are tough, and they take an extremely long period of time, generally speaking, to re-enter the workforce. We don't want to have a generation of young people that are effectively entrenched in unemployment. The wage subsidy in many ways, in my view, is not providing an incentive to employ young people; it's probably just levelling the playing field for young people where the deck is stacked against them. There can be stigma from some employers about young people who are unemployed, they're on the JobSeeker unemployment benefit, they probably don't have a very comprehensive CV and a lot of work experience. They are probably seen in some cases by employers, generally speaking, as a risk to the business, as a risk potentially not worth taking. This is a policy initiative that gives incentive to offset that risk, and I think that is something that should be celebrated and promoted and seen for what it is, which is a way of us targeting the very real potential problem of long-term youth unemployment in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia, one of the most exciting things in the budget has been the confirmation of defence expenditure well into the future. We've already had very important decisions around defence industry naval shipbuilding in South Australia, the Attack class submarine program and the Hunter class frigate program. Both of those are enormous projects—two of the biggest defence acquisitions in the history of this country. I believe the submarine project will be the largest-ever expenditure in not just the defence budget's history but, in fact, the Australian budget's history to acquire the 12 new Attack class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. That wasn't in doubt, and obviously it's not a surprise that that was reconfirmed in the budget. A lot of other significant defence expenditure announcements are, at their core, not only about providing capability to the Australian defence forces—which has always got to be the first priority in these things—but also about building sovereign capability and creating an industry here in Australia. For a long time governments of both persuasions found defence industry not to be as high a priority as it should be. Frankly, when they were acquiring capabilities it was probably only about the capability and the dollars and cents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time we have been an importer of defence capability into this country. We're turning that on its head and we're now not only building defence industry in this country that will provide for our Australian defence forces the highest capability that they must always be given by us but also creating sovereign capability. Sovereign capability is fundamental. It has never been more important as we live in more and more uncertain times not only in our region but across the planet. Having the ability within this country to develop and create capability for our defence forces is vital. To think that we can afford to rely on other countries into the future—no disrespect to the fact that they have been excellent allies for a long time, and I have high confidence that they will be into the future, but we need to be self-sufficient in this country. If there's one thing that the challenges of this global pandemic have shown us, it's that we must be self-sufficient. The Manufacturing Modernisation Fund we have announced in the budget is a very good example of this government investing in the need for sovereign capability and secure supply chains—particularly in areas that are of vital importance when global supply chains are disrupted, as we saw occur because of the coronavirus pandemic. I congratulate the government on the decisions and investments around defence industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of having the Treasurer in my electorate last week. We visited a number of businesses during his visit. People have had a tough time, but they're very grateful and appreciative that their government has been there with them and supported them through these difficult times. I genuinely hope the worst of it is over. But, with that hope fulfilled, the new challenge for us is to make sure that we rebuild this country, better than it was before. I'm very confident that this budget has the policy measures in place to ensure we do just that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the appropriation bills. The Morrison government has delivered a budget—145 days after New Zealand and 151 days late, but delivered. As I read through it, I was stumped. Why did this budget take so long? What was the government waiting on? The forecasts are driven by unrealistic optimism, disregarding much of what we have learned from the COVID virus since May. The policy measures are not innovative, and the politics of the photo op are this government's bread and butter. Four and a half months late seems excessive. But the closer I read, the more I realise that not being on time is the least of this budget's problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison has delivered a budget with a $1 trillion debt. But for all that debt the government have still managed to leave too many workers, families and women behind. For my communities in Corangamite, there is much that is missing: a package that advances renewables and reduces energy prices; affordable child care that helps more women return to work; and a jobs plan for the future—a jobs plan that does not pit one age group against another in pursuit of employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I will be focusing on seven things that my electorate of Corangamite needs that are not in this budget. No. 1: our region hit hard by lockdown needs a strong jobs plan to support it through this COVID crisis. This government did well in following the advice of the Labor Party and introducing a wage subsidy in JobKeeper, but, as with all things, delivery is key. The wage subsidy handed down by the federal government has left casual, university, council, arts, travel and tourism workers, to name a few, out in the cold. To make matters worse the Morrison government cut back JobKeeper in the middle of the pandemic. In Corangamite this meant that $20 million was ripped out of our local economy every fortnight. It makes absolutely no sense to tear vital support out of the economy without replacing it with a comprehensive jobs plan. The International Monetary Fund has consistently and firmly warned against early withdrawal of economic support during weak growth and high unemployment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of many and loud calls to do more, this government has moved to introduce JobMaker and has offered a hiring credit to employers to take on staff aged under 35. But this scheme is ill-conceived. It will result in many older Australians having significant difficulty getting work or perhaps never working again. It also creates an incentive to fire full-time employees and replace them with part-timers. Then there's the boosting apprenticeships scheme, which enables employers to take on subsidised apprentices. This is worthwhile, but the problem is the scheme ends after only 11 months. What's the plan after that? Will employers continue to retain these apprentices? Where are the checks and balances to ensure this happens? We know this government has a poor track record on apprenticeships. There are many fewer apprentices now across our nation and in my electorate than when the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government came in seven years ago. Is this what we want for our nation? These are ill-thought-out plans, and they will hurt my region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 2: my region needs an increase in Newstart. Over 11,000 Corangamite residents are now $300 worse off a fortnight since the federal government cut the coronavirus supplement four weeks ago. This was a blow to many people in my electorate, who have become unemployed due to no fault of their own. At a time when Corangamite remains under extreme economic pressures due to COVID, this cut was cruel and uncaring. It was inflicted at a time when there were 30 Jobseekers for every vacancy in regional Victoria. The result was a huge influx of calls to my office from constituents like Tina, who is a single mum who lost her waitressing job due to the pandemic and is now unemployed and struggling to feed the family and pay the bills. Even before the pandemic, Newstart was less than $40 a day, not enough to pay the rent or the rego, prepare for that job interview and put food on the table. I urge the Morrison/McCormack government to do what's right, increase Newstart and help the people who need it most in my electorate to live their lives with dignity while they search for that much-needed job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 3: Corangamite needs a national disability scheme that respects participants and the workforce. My region needs a government that understands that disability support is not an obligation to be minimised but a great privilege and a serious responsibility. Instead, the Morrison government is introducing independent assessments without real consultation. For many in my electorate this move is causing fear and anxiety, because those with a disability truly believe that it's not about equity and consistency; it's about cost-cutting by stealth. The NDIS is a vital service and we need it. There is much that demands improvement. For example, I recently spoke to the family of a six-year-old boy with a long and complex medical history who has had multiple issues with the NDIS. He was rejected for respite care twice, even though the NDIA agreed that he did qualify for support. This case is still under review; but it should not take the intervention of a federal parliamentarian for participants to get the help and the support they need. The NDIS should be a service first organisation, and this House and this government must do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 4: my region needs a national communicable disease centre. This pandemic has exposed our vulnerability. The last national pandemic preparedness exercise was run by the Rudd government in 2008, 12 years ago. But due to the lack of preparedness by the Morrison government, too many people in my electorate have had their freedom and economic opportunity taken from them. A Labor government, if elected, will address this serious gap in pandemic readiness and establish the Australian Centre for Disease Control, bringing us in line with other advanced economies and ensuring that Corangamite is never again overburdened by the underpreparation of its federal government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 5: my communities demand an aged-care system that cares. This budget takes no steps to fix a broken aged-care system. It does not address resourcing neglect, inadequate staff numbers, training and accountability for how funds are spent. This inaction has resulted in open sores left unattended, people left hungry and alone in their rooms and abuse not identified, nor justice sought. Older Australians deserve better than this. The people of Corangamite deserve better than this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 6: my communities need a reliable energy grid, powered by renewables. We need investment in an energy grid that will use the full force of today's technology to plug us into renewables, service the needs of tomorrow and, importantly, enable Australia to become a renewable superpower. A Labor government will invest in the skills, the research and training required to launch a manufacturing renaissance across this country and with the right investment in regions like mine. This is the path to driving down our emissions and driving down energy bills while driving up our employment and prosperity. This path is right in front of us. It is clear and the Labor Party will take it. This federal government has had 22 energy policies in eight years, and it is just not good enough. It undermines investment, it reduces productivity, it is confusing and it leaves people with high energy bills and no faith in this government to pursue a renewables-led COVID recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 7: my rapidly growing region needs a child-care system that drives productivity and releases Australian women from an unfair bargain they never agreed to. Families across Corangamite should be able to afford child care. Parents should both be able to work and know their children are well cared for, and women should not be financially worse off if they choose to work full-time. It's as simple as that. I recently spoke with Grovedale mum Pawandeep Gill. She wants her little girl to experience the benefits of an early childhood education. Pawandeep would also like to work more, but it makes no sense under the current model. She would just be working to pay for the cost of child care. Under Labor's plan, 97 per cent of families in the system will save between $600 and $2,900 a year. No family will be worse off. Importantly, women will be able to earn more superannuation for a secure retirement. They will be able to advance their skills and hopefully reach their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again, this government has shown that it does not have a comprehensive vision for our future—a future that is inclusive and allows everyone to strive for and reach their potential. With this budget, the Prime Minister has claimed victory but retreated from the battlefield. He has introduced short-term fixes that do not set our nation and my region of Corangamite up for the future. This needs to change and it needs to change now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282918" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LIU</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  Today I wish to talk about several measures in the new budget that will benefit my electorate of Chisholm, Victorians and the greater Australian community. The Morrison government has carefully designed a plan to help breathe life back into the Australian economy. As a Victorian living through the lockdown, I have witnessed the severe impact COVID has had on our economy, and I can tell you with certainty that I talk about these budget measures with a strong sense of relief. This budget is for all Australians, keeping food on the table for families, people in jobs and the doors of businesses open. The Australian people stand to greatly benefit from this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon, many hardworking Australians will begin to feel the positive effects of the Morrison government's tax relief measures. We understand that, for families to keep food on the table, it's vital that they keep more of the money that they make in their back pocket. That's why the government will deliver an additional $17.8 billion in personal income tax relief to support Australia's economic recovery. Australians are best placed to know how to spend their own money. In my own electorate of Chisholm, 74,000 taxpayers will see up to $2,745 of their hard-earned cash given back to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget isn't just about tax relief. Our government understands how tough young people have been doing it throughout COVID-19. For a young person, getting a job during the pandemic has become more and more difficult. Under the new JobMaker program, the strain of trying to secure employment will be dramatically reduced. The JobMaker hiring credit will help accelerate growth in employment during the recovery, by giving businesses incentives to take on additional employees between the ages of 16 and 35. It is estimated that the JobMaker hiring credit will support around 450,000 positions for young Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government understands that the solution for getting Australians back into the workforce needs to be multifaceted. It is for this reason that the JobMaker program emphasises skills development. The government's commitment to JobMaker will support getting people into jobs and ensure that Australians have the right skills for the jobs of the future. This means supporting up to 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships through an additional $1.2 billion investment into the Boosting Apprenticeships Commencements wage subsidy; investing $252 million over two years to support the delivery of 50,000 higher education short courses in areas of teaching, health, information technology, science and agriculture; and giving more Australians the opportunity to gain a university degree in 2021 by supporting the delivery of 30,000 additional university places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is committed to ensuring that Australians are job ready, with jobs waiting for them when they complete their training. The coalition government recognises that, for women in the workplace, it hasn't always been easy. So, in addition to the JobMaker credit and the skills development programs, this budget supports women by providing over $240 million in funding, building on the government's ongoing commitment to deliver for women. But it doesn't stop there. Supporting women in STEM study and STEM skills jobs is a priority. That's why the Morrison government is providing $25 million to assist women through STEM industry cadetships or advanced apprenticeships whilst also expanding the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship program over two years from 2022-23. These are just the highlights of a range of commitments and policies that we have carefully tailored to the task of supporting Australian women in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just individuals but Chisholm businesses that stand to benefit from this budget. Our local businesses have been hit hard by COVID-19. Health restrictions in Victoria have forced many shops and business premises to close their doors or reduce capacity. Meanwhile the bills have continued to rack up. There is no doubt that businesses are up against it due to the COVID recession, but the Morrison government is committed to giving them a fighting chance. This year the cash flow boost has already delivered more than $28 billion in support to keep 800,000 Australian small and medium-sized businesses afloat. The initiative of the JobKeeper program has also cushioned the blow of lockdown restrictions, providing a $101 billion lifeline and helping businesses to maintain the crucial connection with their employees. Thanks to JobKeeper so many Chisholm businesses have survived and are poised to fire again when restrictions are eased.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic recovery plan for Australia presented in this year's budget delivers several further important measures that will bolster the engine room of the Australian economy, which is the private sector. Firstly, we're unlocking investment. Over 99 per cent of Chisholm and Australian businesses will be able to write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase for their business, whether it's the manufacturer expanding their production line, a sole trader purchasing a car to help them deliver their wares or an entrepreneur working from home investing in new tech. This write-off will give businesses the kick-start they need to thrive post COVID. It will also create tens of thousands of jobs. This is a win for every sector of our economy, but the small businesses that buy, sell, deliver and install the purchased assets will really benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, let's talk about manufacturing. Manufacturing employs around 860,000 Australians, including around 4,000 workers in my electorate of Chisholm. It is the key to our economic future. Australian manufacturers stepped up during the pandemic and now the Morrison government is backing them to create jobs and drive our economic recovery. Our $1.5 billion targeted Modern Manufacturing Strategy will help Chisholm manufacturers to scale up and take on the world. It will assist them to seize market growth opportunities in our national manufacturing priority areas of food and beverages, resource technology, medical products, recycling and clean energy, defence industry, and space industry. This is great news not just for Chisholm manufacturers but for the whole nation. World-class manufacturing will drive our economic recovery and deliver a prosperous future for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this we are: helping businesses to hire young enthusiastic workers, with our JobMaker hiring credit; reducing the cost and time it takes businesses to access credit; reforming insolvency laws to support business recovery; and expanding access to small business tax concessions to reduce pressures on businesses and allow them to invest in the future. It was suggested by a member of the opposition in the House of Representatives yesterday that each budget reflects the values of the government that hands it down. I wholeheartedly agree. The coalition government is the party of small business. It's the party of business in general I would say. This budget proves it. The private sector, as I mentioned previously, is the engine room—</span>

                    </a>  No. The budget goes a long way to helping businesses and people alike keep money in their wallets and their doors open, but some groups of people need specialised help. As someone who suffers from hearing loss, I understand the plight of the Deaf Society. While they have come a long way in raising awareness and supporting one another, they still require resources to accomplish these things. The Morrison government recognise this. We understand that there are groups out there that need extra and special attention. I can proudly say that the Morrison government will deliver for the hard-of-hearing community by implementing key initiatives from the Roadmap for Hearing Health through the investment of over $21 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the hard-of-hearing community that will benefit. Another key community group that the government will address is Australians from diverse ethnic backgrounds. As a proud member of a multicultural community, I have seen our recent and long-term migrants to be resilient, hardworking, kind and diligent. At times, though, there will be a disconnect between multicultural communities and Australian governments. We saw this during the early stages of the second wave of COVID in Victoria. The Victorian government was unable to effectively communicate the dangers and risk of the pandemic. The Morrison government recognises the need to address this problem—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I'm very glad to speak on the appropriations bills and the government's budget on behalf of the people of Fremantle. I always feel proud and privileged to represent my community here on such an important matter. For those who are playing at home, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021 and cognate bills are the means by which the government gets the money to pay for its programs. They're always important, even if they sound a bit boring. They've never been more important than they are right now in 2020, and there are two reasons for that. The first is because we're facing a global pandemic—a health crisis that, in turn, is having severe economic impacts. They're also important because, in response, the government is embarking on a massive program of borrowing and spending, the likes of which we have not seen in my lifetime, and the consequences of which will play out for decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The brutal reality is that you cannot borrow and spend this gargantuan quantity of money twice—you cannot—and so you have to get it right. I think most people, even at this early stage after the budget has been handed down, know that, unfortunately, it's not looking very good so far. It's not looking very good, because the budget's falling short of the obvious tests that should apply. These are: will it meet the needs of the Australian community, especially those facing the most acute impacts and the sharpest disadvantage, and will it provide lasting benefits that will carry us through from the survival phase into the recovery? Will it shape a stronger and fairer Australia? Unfortunately, we already know that there are so many people in so many sectors that are not having their needs met, and there is absolutely nothing in the budget. I didn't have high expectations of the budget, but even I was taken by surprise that there is nothing that looks to the medium- or long-term needs of Australia. There is nothing that builds on the most important things, which are the things we share: public education; public health; public infrastructure, like transport and community infrastructure; our environment; and our biodiversity, which is in crisis and should be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison budget, in response to the Morrison recession, comes at a time of crisis—not just the pandemic but the aftermath of Australia's first national climate change disaster, in the form of last summer's unprecedented bushfires; not just the challenges at home, here in Australia, but the challenges in our region and in our trading relationships. The budget should respond to those circumstances, and that's how the government will be judged. There are lots of ways in which a government can be judged. In the course of the debate, we've heard already, and we'll continue to hear, lots of frames or perspectives or rubrics that seek to establish the basis upon which the budget will be judged. Some of them might be a bit critical. That's what the government will say of us—that we're being hypercritical. You can be sure that some in the government will be ultra-self-serving. In fact, we heard a little bit of that just before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing you can't do as a government is walk away from the standards you set for yourself. The government were elected in 2013 on the basis that they would face up to and phase down what they called a 'debt and deficit emergency'. That was pretty much the only thing that they said, and they said it over and over again. Well, they doubled the national debt in this country before the pandemic. They presided over stagnant wages, falling productivity and weak growth, and they doubled the debt. That was before the pandemic occurred, and Australians know that. They will run a deficit in this year alone that is larger than the net debt they inherited in 2013. Despite the $35 'Back in Black' mugs, despite the linguistic time-travelling of the Prime Minister, who said that he and his government had delivered a budget surplus for next year, they have not delivered a single surplus, and tackling debt and deficit was their one purpose. That's the frame they chose for themselves in seeking election in 2013. That's the frame that they set for themselves at every step of the way and, by that standard, they have utterly failed. We came into this crisis with a weak and weakening economy, which will make dealing with the social and economic impacts of this crisis that much harder, but you won't hear that from the government and you won't hear it from speaker after speaker in this debate. The Treasurer, in question time, described it as a 'ripper' of a budget—a Jack the Ripper budget maybe! I heard the member for Fisher say that it was a 'sensational budget for all Australians'—every single one—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr JOSH WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  That's right. Twenty-five million Australians—it's a sensational budget for every single one. However you might consider that, that is some seriously tone-deaf, own trumpet-blowing right there. At a time of crisis, when so many people are facing the most difficult year they've ever experienced, to describe it as a 'ripper' of a budget and say it is 'sensational' for each and every Australian is pretty rich and it's certainly tone-deaf. Does the government really think that the millions of Australians facing these circumstances—a global pandemic; the first recession in 30 years; the sharpest and deepest recession in almost a century—regard what they have just announced as being 'sensational'? People on JobKeeper are already seeing support being withdrawn and they know that it will be taken away all together, and there are so many sectors of the economy that have not even begun to recover—people in aviation, people in the arts and culture industries, people in tourism. The support was delivered too late, and it's being taken away too soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are all the millions who were excluded in the first place—casuals who have worked fewer than 12 months, people in local government, people in universities, people in arts and cultural work and businesses. There are the people on JobSeeker, who do not know, since the budget was announced, what is going to happen to them. Some of the people who are currently on JobKeeper will be on JobSeeker before too long. More than a million Australians are going to see their support go down to $40 a day. That is below the poverty level. Do they think that the budget is sensational? They haven't been given the certainty of what is going to happen to them in the months to come. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the students in the university courses who know that their fees are about to double. In a time of recession, when there isn't work, when you've got massive unemployment that is already staggering and will grow by a further 160,000 people before Christmas, according to the Treasurer himself, young people understandably think, 'I might as well take this opportunity to try and get some training and some education for my future.' Well, in all of the courses in the humanities and some related areas, fees are about to double. There are the Australians stranded overseas. Do they think it's a sensational budget? Then there are the small and medium businesses in all of the sectors I mentioned, but particularly tourism, arts and culture, transport and logistics and aviation. Do they think it's a sensational budget? I don't think so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a little bit of time on the particular circumstances of the workers and small businesses in the arts and creative sector. I'm lucky to come from and to represent a community where arts and creative industries are a strong feature of our life—our personal lives, our cultural life and our economic life. But they have always been a 'heroes and villains' government: if they like you, you get a gift; if they don't like you, you get a whack. That's the one thing we know about the government. There are tax cuts for big business, even if they're massively profitable, even if they're based overseas, but job cuts for the public broadcaster. If you're a Liberal donor and you've got a $3 million piece of land: 'How about we pay you $30 million instead?' How do you like them apples? That's not too bad. But if you want to study the humanities, like most of the members of the government did: 'Sorry, the cost of your degree has just doubled.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arts and creative sector has been in the gun sight for years, thanks to this government. Does that make any sense whatsoever in the 21st century? No. It's a massive part of our life and a massive part of our economy, and it's going to and should get stronger in future. It employs 650,000 people—53,000 people in Western Australia alone. In 2017 it contributed $111 billion to the economy. In March, as the pandemic hit, I Lost My Gig Australia helped take stock of the impact on arts and cultural businesses. Half a million workers were impacted. In terms of business lost, 240,000 jobs disappeared and $330 million worth of projects disappeared. That was in March. The ABS noted at the end of March that, while 90 per cent of all businesses in Australia were still operating to some degree at the end of March, only 47 per cent of arts businesses were still operating. It was the worst-affected industry. It will be one of the slowest to emerge from the circumstances we now face. But the sector hasn't been adequately supported by JobKeeper. It's one of those areas of Australian life that was just ignored and neglected by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many of their announcements, where the funding doesn't appear, the direct funding announced by the government hasn't appeared. That's been true for arts and cultural businesses and their workers, including—in terms of the difference between announcement and delivery—some of the businesses and the people that the government used in its media stunts for the announcements. Some of those people have subsequently had to put up their hand and say, 'Even we haven't received the promised funding.' It's just ridiculous. Rather than make reforms that would be helpful to arts and creative industry businesses and their workers, the government's decided in a crisis to take away the local content requirements for the screen industry that are essential to maintaining a distinctively Australian cultural sector—to see and hear and learn from and be enriched and uplifted by Australian voices, Australian stories, Australian songs and Australian films. They have been let down; they have been neglected by this government throughout its life; and then they are facing a particularly cold shoulder through the circumstances of a COVID-19 pandemic. It is appalling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that the budget should be judged on how it meets the needs of the Australian community and how it provides long-lasting benefits. We know that, despite a trillion dollars of debt, there will be millions of Australians left in the cold. To make it worse, the government has not taken the opportunity to look at areas of longer-lasting reforms, things that will provide benefits to all of us in the future, notwithstanding this eye-watering, gargantuan sum of money that has been borrowed and spent that can never be borrowed and spent again. There's no focus on early child care or aged care, when we know that the care economy is going to be such a big part of our life—for our own benefit, for our health and wellbeing, but also as a source of jobs and economic activity. There's no focus in the budget on modernising our energy supply, not surprisingly from a government that can't even settle a national energy policy. There's no focus on social housing, despite the difference that makes to the lives of people facing acute disadvantage and the way in which it provides stimulus to local economies around the country. Over the seven years this government has presided over the loss of 140,000 apprentices, and that's caused key shortages that we're now dealing with. Only in the last week or so it's finally admitted to itself that delivering that National Broadband Network using 19th century copper wasn't such a bright idea. Now it's going to cost billions more in funding and take years longer, as they start to turn the ship around and go back to Labor's policy of delivering fibre. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a time of crisis that has a number of elements, the pandemic chief among them but not alone, it's crucial that government spend wisely. The gargantuan borrowing and spending exercise cannot be done twice. It should be focused on the needs of the Australian community and it should deliver lasting benefits. Unfortunately, the Morrison government's economic management was weak before the crisis, and the Morrison government's economic response to date has been warped during the crisis so far, not just ignoring huge sections of the community, but ignoring some of the people who need the help the most. The government's response has every appearance of being wasteful because it doesn't focus on the delivery of lasting benefits. At every point in the last seven years you'd struggle to identify a recognisable agenda or a positive program that this government might be seeking to implement. In fact, I defy anyone to point to one notable reform or lasting achievement of this coalition government. They were elected as the masters of negativity. They set one task for themselves, which was to reduce debt, and they have comprehensively failed to do that. They doubled it before the pandemic, and it will quadruple by the time we get through the pandemic. They have neglected to do anything in aged care or early childhood education. They have made a howling mess of Australia's broadband network. They've been unable to settle on a national energy policy. They've hammered both our vocational and our university education sectors. They've waged a cultural and funding war on public broadcasters. They've sat on their hands as we face an extinction crisis and the impacts of climate change. Weak, warped, wasteful—that's been the record of this government. Unfortunately it's a theme they continue with this budget, when Australia needs them to do so much better.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:13</span>):  This budget is the next step in our economic recovery from COVID-19. It's about helping those who are out of work to get into work and helping those who are in a job to keep their job. We're investing heavily in infrastructure that will not only benefit our community but create jobs in the short and long term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about some fantastic projects that are going to be getting underway or have started in Townsville, because Townsville is in Herbert and Herbert is the best electorate in this place. There is $76 million for Riverway Drive Stage 2. This project will create a whopping 280 direct and indirect jobs over its construction lifetime. These 280 jobs don't just support the construction industry. There are not only the men and women who are working on the construction going in local cafes to get their bacon and egg burger in the morning and cafes putting on extra staff to help with admin but there's also the flow-on effect that has for the economy. So, while we talk about construction, actually there's a wraparound that affects the whole community and the whole economy in Townsville. This will not only benefit residents of the Upper Ross but also drive our economy forward with significant investment in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The upgrade will cover from Allambie Lane up to Dunlop Street, duplicating a 1.6 kilometre section between Allambie Lane and Hammond Way, while safety upgrades for 3.1 kilometres between Allambie Lane and Dunlop Street will add three sets of traffic lights in that section to ensure safety and traffic flow. This will reduce congestion and improve travel times and safety, and I know everyone, regardless of what colour shirt you wear in this place, thinks road safety and ensuring that people who leave in the morning come home safely at night is extremely important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-GeneralIInterjecting">An honourable member interjecting</span>—  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281826" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr THOMPSON:</span>
                    </a>  You wear white shirts? Excellent heckling from the opposition! There's also $20 million for the Bruce Highway upgrade, which is about developing a plan for the future along the Bruce Highway. This important work on the duplication of the entire Bruce Highway will start in priority sections, and I would suggest that priority sections would be in the north. We know that too many people have died on our roads, and any investment in the safety of our roads is a good one, a welcome one and something that needs to always be at the forefront of everyone's minds when we're doing construction and duplications on our roads. This is in addition to our $184 million commitment for the Townsville Ring Road Stage 5 and $86 million for the Northern Access Intersections Upgrade, duplicating the Bruce Highway between Veales Road and Pope Road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing in CopperString. CopperString is a fan favourite, and it's a fan favourite because it's going to connect the north-west minerals province, which is near Mt Isa—or the Isa for locals—to the National Energy Market, the NEM, which is near Townsville. We know that this will put downward pressure on electricity prices and also create jobs, but the downward pressure on electricity prices is what's important, because industry—big business, mining companies and manufacturing—want to go where there's cheap electricity. They want to go where they can run their business at a lower cost than somewhere else, and this is something that I know, regardless of political party, has support, because CopperString is the future and it is something that will definitely benefit the north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also investing $60 million for a monsoon trough long-term recovery strategy. This is extremely important for the residents of Townsville but also for the north, because not so long ago we saw a one-in-500-year monsoon event in Townsville. We still have people that are struggling to get back into properties. We have insurance which is a market failure because of this and other things, and a head of cattle and farmers were devastated. This is something that I believe is needed to help the community. But, when you say, '$60 million,' what does that actually mean? We need to break it down a little bit because it's not just a number; there are important strategies involved. I hope the member across from me gets here soon—I could finish quick so he might have to jump up and talk! What we're spending is $9 million for projects that support emerging industries, extend small-scale industries and add value to existing industries and their supply chains to generate economic and development opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The telecommunications and energy improvements are going to have a $15 million price tag and will support locally-led solutions that improve access to reliable and affordable telecommunications and energy services to support business and community growth. I think the key thing to take out of that was 'locally-led solutions'—not Canberra based led solutions, not Brisbane based led solutions but locally-led solutions. Not only will local governments have a lot to play here but also community groups, because any good level of government creates the healthy environment for them and the community to do what they do best and do their job and tell us what they need, not be told what to do from some bureaucrat in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For managing disaster risks, there is $12 million for improved disaster risk management planning and risk mitigation. The funding will be available for individuals, enterprises, industries and communities, to increase risk management capability and capacity building. My favourite bit of this funding is for helping young people to be resilient. It's $2 million to support preventative mental health measures for children who have been in flood affected areas, making children more equipped with skills to identify the early signs of mental stress, talk about mental wellbeing and know where to turn for help. This is on top of the funding that's already been made available, but there's nothing more important than ensuring that our young people, our future, are mentally well and know how to communicate and who they can talk to. This is funding that is definitely needed. Headspace—and National headspace Day was yesterday—is overwhelmed with young people who are trying to get in and see a counsellor, and there's a long waitlist, so any extra funding to give support to these hardworking men and women who help our young people will be welcomed. The recovery and resilience grants have $20 million for locally led solutions that improve the strategy's objective. Flood affected individuals, businesses and communities will be actively involved in the region's recovery, to make sure that local needs are a top consideration. Once again this is locally led, and that's something that is welcomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got $40 million for Reef HQ. Reef HQ is one of the wonders of the world. This is the largest and oldest coral aquarium in the world. We are on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef. With Reef HQ, our young people, our scientists and people from all around the world can come and visit and learn about the reef, learn about the fish, learn about the corals, go to the dangerous predators area, walk through the tunnel and see all the sharks swimming around. It's great for education, great for our young people, great for Townsville. We know we have the leading university in marine biology and marine science, JCU, and Reef HQ works hand in glove with them. I have asked if I can go for a dive and a snorkel in Reef HQ, but I'll be keeping away from the predator tank, because I'd be a tasty little snack for a shark! This $40 million is not just to improve the inside but also to give Reef HQ a facelift on the outside. You don't just want to see the inside of the best coral aquarium in the world; you also want to have a nice experience from the outside, so we're making sure it gets a bit of a facelift. Pre COVID, Reef HQ generated in the order of $2 million of revenue each year. This is reported in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's annual reports. They get around 130,000 visitors each year. Ramping up what Reef HQ will look like and the facilities—making sure that the turtle hospital there is not on the roof, in the sun, making sure that they have appropriate measures to look after the sick and injured wildlife that they pick up—and the experience that the young people have is so important. I know that Josh, the CEO, has been lobbying me and other members pretty hard. I see the importance as he does, and so do the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With defence, there is $1 billion over two years to deliver projects that will support an estimated 4,000 jobs. This is across Australia. The reason I'm bringing it up today is that in Townsville we are the largest garrison city in the country, so we know that this kind of spend will be fantastic in Townsville, creating those local jobs and driving the economy. It will also increase the employment of our reservists in the Australian Defence Force. This funding will look after them a little bit more, since some of our ADF reservists have lost their jobs through the coronavirus pandemic. It will also increase funding available for defence innovation industries and skills grants. It's very important that we grow our defence industry inside Australia and look to our professionals here to grow this industry instead of always looking at what we can get from somewhere else around the world. What we've learned through this pandemic is that it's extremely important to have manufacturing in Australia. We have always known that, but there's nothing more important now to drive our economy and to keep our nation safe and its sovereignty secure. We must bring forward investment in defence estate and accelerate important ADF capability development projects. Like much of the economy, our local defence industry is doing it tough because of COVID-19. We know this is especially so for small and medium businesses that support our defence industry. Australia's largest garrison city is Townsville, and I do expect quite a big piece of this pie for it; I hope Linda Reynolds is watching, because I'll be knocking on her door soon to talk about where we can get some of this funding rolled out in Townsville.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Herbert specifically, 57,700 taxpayers will benefit from the tax relief of up to $2,745 this year. It's important that we note that it's their money. It's not a handout; it's not a gift—this is taxpayers' money; it's their money. They're keeping more of what they earn. That is extremely important, because, in a time where we are all doing it tough, having more of our money in our hip pocket so we can spend it the way we like is something that I know that everyone wants to see. I spoke to my mum about this, and she was very happy. She said, 'You tell my Josh I'm very happy I can spend more of my money on what I want to do.' It does not feel like a handout, because it's not; it's their money, and they should keep more of their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot of people in Townsville that are doing it tough and we have a lot of small and medium businesses that are also doing it quite tough. I know that 10,100 businesses in Herbert will write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase, building on the success of the instant asset write-off earlier this year. JobKeeper is supporting around 2,700 businesses in the electorate of Herbert. It is supporting them through the pandemic and keeping them connected to their employees. As they move off JobKeeper—I know that a lot of them are trying their best to do that—and get on with doing what they do best, getting governments out of their way and not having politicians ringing them all the time saying: 'Hey, how are you doing? Is there anything you need?'—they just want to get on with what they do best. The Ville in Townsville is a fantastic place; it connects to the casino. A lot of people that come from and travel to this place will stay there. They had to let a lot of people go at the start of the pandemic. I was speaking to their CEO, and they're bringing more and more people back on. We want to see them operating near normal. We haven't had a positive case of COVID-19 for several months, so we're nearly back to normal in our operating. Easing restrictions there a bit will be welcomed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my last 30-odd seconds I just want to say that, regardless of politics in this place, I know that everyone puts their community first. Through this global pandemic, which has been so tough, I just think it's so important that we all link together and learn from each other, to best support our communities around the nation. The people have to come first, and that's exactly what we need to put first—the people of Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  The Morrison government's approach to our biggest health and economic crisis has not protected Australians as well as it should have, and its budget will not navigate Australia out of the recession with the urgency, efficiency or innovation that a once-in-a-100-year budget should contain. Put simply, the Morrison government's response to the economic crisis has not served and will not serve the people of Australia or my electorate of Corangamite as well as it should. This government has a simple plan in place: wait for the media and Australians to point out big problems and then focus on the media response rather than any real solutions. It's not good enough. We need a better plan for recovery. Australians are suffering and they need a federal government that can step up. Labor's vision includes driving employment and limiting the impacts of the recession by investing in social housing, and establishing a centre for disease control to protect Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know three things right now: (1) there are 100,000 homes run by Australian governments that are desperately in need of repair; (2) there are hundreds of thousands of Australian tradespeople who will experience drawn out underemployment through the COVID recovery; and (3) we are in the middle of a deep recession, and the government must spend to shorten the length of economic underperformance. Knowing these three things leads sensible people to one conclusion: the government should invest in social housing. Concerningly, this isn't on the Morrison government's agenda, despite calls from community organisations and building industry peak bodies such as the Master Builders Association. The government is refusing to stimulate the building sector through a program of community and social housing works that could begin tomorrow. Labor is calling on the government to fix these houses, create jobs and shorten the recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should invest $500 million to fast-track urgently needed repairs. When I talk to plumbers, bricklayers, builders and sparkies in Corangamite, they tell me they are ready for more work but the demand just isn't there right now. The government needs to step up. Social housing works. It will create this demand, and these tradies have the skills. Most importantly, they can do these works to ensure all social housing residents have safe and secure homes to live in. This plan will generate jobs, including jobs for apprentices and young Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coronavirus took even the best prepared countries by surprise, but there is no excuse for the health and wellbeing of Australians suffering as a result of underpreparation by the federal government. Our response to the coronavirus pandemic was too slow, too reactive and too uncoordinated. Coronavirus has affected more than 27,000 Australians and killed almost 900. Each of these deaths is a tragedy. Lockdowns are vital to stop the spread, but we also know that lockdowns have a significant impact on wellbeing. Restrictions have taken a huge toll on economic prosperity and mental health across the country and in my electorate of Corangamite. It is unacceptable that the last time the federal government ran a national pandemic drill was in 2008—12 years ago under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Failure to prepare is preparing to fail, and by failing to run a national pandemic drill the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government failed to prepare for this devastating pandemic. Australia is the only country in the OECD that doesn't have a centre for disease control. An Albanese Labor government will correct this failure. Establishing a centre for disease control will ensure that we are never caught so unprepared as we were this time. To strengthen Australia's preparedness, the CDC will employ experts and build systems for current and emerging threats to the health of Australians. It will be monitored and acted on swiftly. It will work with state and territory governments and service providers to improve preparedness in the health and aged-care sectors; manage the National Medical Stockpile, ensuring supplies like PPE are available immediately to every medical profession, community organisation and person who needs them; run regular preparedness drills on the scale of exercise sustained in 2008; and work with other countries on regional and global preparedness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An Australian centre for disease control is a no-brainer and so is investment in social housing. It is policies such as these that demonstrate that our Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has a vision to create a fairer, safer and more prosperous Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  The Treasurer has often said there is no economic recovery without jobs recovery, and the budget is all about jobs. In Western Sydney, our manufacturers are primed to unlock their potential and create more local jobs. We hold the key to the new era in Australian manufacturing. After handing down one of the most significant budgets in our nation's history, the Treasurer's first stop was at my electorate of Lindsay and to a proud Australian manufacturer. I brought the Treasurer to SpanSet, where Kristian and the team are creating high-quality safety harnesses to keep workers safe on building sites across Australia, and round slings with the strength to lift thousands of kilos, which are even used by the Australian Defence Force for heavy vehicles. SpanSet relied on JobKeeper to get them through the toughest parts of the coronavirus pandemic. They are one of 5,000 businesses in Lindsay that have been supported by JobKeeper to stay in business and stay connected to their employees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joining Kristian to welcome the Treasurer was Frank Zammit of Two Way Cranes, another proud Australian business based in Western Sydney. Frank's story is one of hard work and aspiration. In less than two decades, Frank went from purchasing his first crane to now having a fleet of 44. He employs over 120 people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the type of aspiration that we are putting at the centre of our plan to lead our economic recovery and create more jobs. Small businesses are the job creators of our economy, and people in small business and Australian manufacturing, like Kristian and Frank, know this as well as anyone. Frank told me how they had also accessed JobKeeper during the pandemic to help them get through. Just like SpanSet and thousands of other Australian businesses in Western Sydney and across Australia, Two Way Cranes have the resilience to withstand the recent challenges and come out the other side ready to take advantage of the government support to help them create more jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we are putting in place the measures to support Australian manufacturers, which will help them become more competitive, scale up, expand and ultimately create local jobs. A key part of our plan is the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative. We are investing in medical products, defence, resources technology and critical minerals processing, food and beverage, recycling, clean energy, and the space industry. To ensure we have the resilience to mitigate the impact of future shocks to global supply chains and address our critical supply needs, we are investing $107 million in the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative. This will build resilience in these critical sectors, reduce risk and increase our agility to respond to changes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Lindsay, the Treasurer also took part in a roundtable discussion with my Advancing Manufacturing Taskforce. I established this task force to address the barriers facing Western Sydney manufacturers and to explore the opportunities to create local jobs, because I believe we can deliver the best outcomes when we listen directly to manufacturers who are confronting these challenges on the ground every single day. Former Prime Minister John Howard describes Lindsay as a microcosm of Australia, with many hard-working small businesses and young families. At the budget briefing, the Treasurer fielded questions from local manufacturers and small business owners, representatives from the community, local swim schools, hotels, Aboriginal organisations and universities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An important issue across all parts of our community is easing congestion and improving safety on our roads. From local families getting to work and school in the morning and back home in the evening, to the thousands of small businesses moving their products across our community and beyond, better, safer roads make our community an even more wonderful a place to live, work and stay. I fought hard during the election to secure $63½ million to upgrade Dunheved Road and an additional $63½ million in the budget to fully fund the complete upgrade of Dunheved Road. That's $127 million for a full upgrade to this road that is so important to our community. I brought members of our community who got behind me to meet the Treasurer. These are people who signed my petition and who really fought for this road upgrade, which will mean so much to them, their families and their small businesses. For Nicole, a local truck driver who has used Dunheved Road almost every day for the last decade, this important upgrade means that her business is not getting held up in traffic and can reach its potential. For Luke, the general manager of Penrith Valley Regional Sports Centre, this upgrade means that his commute to work and home again is going to be quicker and safer. For all of our community, I look forward to this budget measure and supporting you in the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:39</span>):  There has been a lot of talk this week about the word 'integrity'. What does that word actually mean? Etymology-wise it's Middle English, from the French 'integrite'. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian concise Oxford dictionary</span> defines integrity as 'moral uprightness, honesty'. The online <span style="font-style:italic;">Cambridge dictionary</span> defines it as 'the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles that you refuse to change'. Every person who serves the people of Australia in this House should have these qualities. Australians should have confidence that their representatives have integrity. However, without a powerful and independent national integrity commission, they can't be confident about their representatives' integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last seven years of coalition government have not filled anyone with confidence when it comes to integrity. Now in their eighth year in office, let's pick over the long trail of scandals scattered in the coalition's wake. I will only do the top 10 because I don't have enough time. They include using taxpayers' money to pay 10 times too much to a Liberal Party donor for a piece of land alongside the new Sydney Airport. That doesn't sound like integrity to me. A federal judge said that a minister had engaged in criminal conduct by unlawfully depriving an asylum seeker of his liberty. Criminal conduct is not your classic definition of integrity. Then we have overseeing a scheme where Services Australia illegally issued debt collection notices to more than 370,000 Australians, where more than 2,000 people died, some from suicide, despite the government being warned it was illegal. That's not integrity. The member for New England paid $80 million for water rights in the Murray-Darling Basin, a quarter more than the seller asked. That reeks of something but it ain't integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An unheard of company with a head office in a shack on Kangaroo Island was awarded a $423 million contract to run refugee camps on Manus Island—under a limited tender, the only company invited to bid. That's hardly integrity. The current Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction sought meetings with senior environment officials about an ongoing investigation by the department into grasslands part owned by the minister. That smells more like equine faeces than integrity. The Minister for Home Affairs intervened to have two au pairs who were about to be deported released from immigration detention after he was contacted by a former colleague—definitely not integrity. The Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction—him again—used a fraudulent document and couldn't explain how he got it, in an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the Sydney Lord Mayor—not integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And who could forget the sports rorts saga, when changes were made to a list of sports grant recipients by the minister in consultation with the Prime Minister's office, after entering caretaker period? Sports Australia had no knowledge of six of the grants and no application form. There's no hint of integrity there at all. Just this week we found out that an investigation into alleged branch stacking involving taxpayer funded electorate staff in the offices of two Liberal MPs, including the Assistant Treasurer, was outsourced to the Assistant Treasurer's old law firm. That is not even in the same suburb as integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's obvious to every Australian, other than those in the Morrison government, that we urgently need a national integrity commission right now. We must restore confidence in our national politics. A national integrity commission that is powerful and independent will go some way towards repairing the damage done by our stale coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, who holidays in Hawaii while the nation is on fire and campaigns for a week alongside Deb Frecklington in the Queensland state election and builds a chook shed on his rent-free property, tells us that he is too busy dealing with COVID-19 to devote time to establishing a national integrity commission. But in June this year, in the middle of the pandemic, Prime Minister Morrison found the time to establish the Higher Education Integrity Unit—yes, a unit to ensure that students have integrity when it comes to them doing their university assessments, to stop them cheating. The Morrison government had time to draft legislation that provided harsh penalties, including imprisonment for students and strict liability in some cases, to provide a deterrent to academic cheating. They had time to introduce that legislation and have it pass through parliament and had time to announce funding on 24 June this year for the new Higher Education Integrity Unit. Student cheating warranted their time in this pandemic year, but apparently holding government members to account, making sure they spend taxpayers' money with integrity, is not important enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2018, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister announced that, for nearly a year, they had been working on a 'robust, resource real system that will protect the integrity of Commonwealth and public administration'. But, after nearly three years, there's no legislation, no commission and no integrity. When a government thinks that holding students to account is more important than holding their own government members to account, that is a serious problem. That is a government lacking in integrity.</span>

                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  Earlier in this chamber I had the opportunity to reflect on the appropriation bills in the second reading debate. I want to add something very important to that contribution—specifically something that was announced in the budget two weeks ago. The Treasurer joined me in Adelaide last week to announce that the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and Andrew Steiner Education Centre would receive a $2½ million capital grant from the Commonwealth to assist with the very important work that they do in Holocaust awareness education and remembrance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Steiner is the great pioneer of this institution. He's a constituent of mine. He is 87 years old. He was born in 1933—a Hungarian Jewish boy—the year that Hitler came to power under the Nazi regime in Germany. He obviously didn't have a childhood like we understand a childhood to be. It was one of fear, terror and murder. Thankfully, he is a survivor, but of course he and many other people lost six million relatives—their fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles—and friends in that most disgraceful and disgusting period of history. It's beyond question that this is the most appalling event in the history of humanity. Nonetheless, as we say, those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it. As much as it's such a disgusting chapter, it's vitally important that young people in particular are aware of what happened in Europe during that regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Adelaide Holocaust Museum is about to open on 9 November. Nine November is the commemoration of Kristallnacht, which was the awful terror that occurred throughout many major cities in Germany when Jewish businesses and Jewish people were attacked. Part of that commemoration will be the opening of this museum and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Catholic archdioceses in Adelaide have been very good to donate the building where the museum is located. We had the archbishop with us last week. I put on the record the support of the archdioceses of Adelaide in providing that space. This was very much an initiative that initially was quite underresourced financially. There was a lot of passion from those associated with it. We have a very small Jewish community in South Australia, probably numbering about 1,200. Obviously in cities like Melbourne and Sydney numerically it's much larger. Of course, the Adelaide Jewish community has the same passion as any Jewish community. They have done a fantastic job in getting the museum to the point it is at now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $2½ million commitment from the Commonwealth will be transformative of their ability to engage with students and bring student groups in. The state government has agreed to put Holocaust education into the year 10 curriculum in South Australia. That will mean that schools have the ability to deliver that education program as part of year 10. Of course we want to see that culminate in a visit to the museum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are not many survivors left now. Mr Steiner is now 87 years old, having been born in 1933. We don't have much time left with people who actually witnessed what occurred and can explain in their own words to the next generation what happened. For as long as he has breath in his lungs, he will be engaging in that. He's so passionate about ensuring that there is an awareness of what happened and that it contributes to our humanity. Even after he is gone we will have an asset in Adelaide that means that for a long time into the future—hopefully, in perpetuity—we will be educating our young people about the most horrendous chapter of human history and in so doing ensure that it is never repeated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  As Diwali comes around again I would like to take this opportunity to wish all those in my community who celebrate the Festival of Light—the Hindus, the Sikhs and the Jains—a very happy and harmonious Diwali. Diwali symbolises the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance—all the great battles that take place within us. Last year, I joined the community at real celebrations in actual places: in Westmead, organised by the Darcy Road Public School P&amp;C; at the Little India Fair in Harris Park, organised by the Council of Indian Australians; in Wentworthville, hosted by Cumberland council; and in Silverwater with the Sydney Baha'i Centre. But this year will be different. Celebrations have been scaled back or they're moving online to be COVID-safe. Honestly, I have a few new saris, so it's a bit of a disaster for me not to be actually going! Seriously, I will be sad to miss the Diwali celebrations in Wentworthville on 29 October next week, put on by three great local organisations, the Karabi Community and Development Services, Boronia Multicultural Services, and Sewa Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to be caught up in our everyday lives and we forget to take the time to remember that we all have the power to choose to be kind, considerate and compassionate, and this is what Diwali is all about. I'm lucky enough to live in a community that celebrates all types of cultures and religions, and our celebration of Diwali is a very special part of who we are. A young friend of mine often says to me, and I say it to my community now: you be you in all your glory. Celebrate this wonderful event and have a very happy Diwali.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Sydney Awards for Business Excellence will be announced on Friday 20 November. The WSABEs were started by the Parramatta Chamber of Commerce in 1990, so this is their 30th birthday. They are well and truly part of the landscape these days and everyone wants to win one. I've been lucky to have been on the judging panel for the awards for a couple of years running and was blown away once again by the strength of our local businesses. I want to mention just some of the amazing finalists, some of which I judged and some of which were in other categories, but they are wonderful. Adaptas is a finalist in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Excellence in Export award for advanced manufacturing of scientific instruments for export. Adactin, a software consulting company that tests for companies across the public and private sector, is a finalist in EnergyAustralia Excellence in Business. People At Their Best, consultants that help organisations and their leaders develop and build capacity to achieve their business goals, is a finalist in the City of Parramatta Excellence in Customer Service award. WestWords, which promotes and encourages reading, writing and story-making by and for children and young people living in Western Sydney through workshops, fellowships, residencies and support for writers, is a finalist in two categories: Commonwealth Bank Excellence in Arts and Culture, and AAA City Removalist Outstanding Business Leader, for executive director Michael Campbell. I want to thank the Parramatta Chamber of Commerce for providing this platform to recognise and celebrate the extraordinary contribution of local businesses. Every time I judge these awards, I'm astonished by just how good many of our local businesses are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A young woman approached my office recently to express her horror at the government's increase in fees for humanities and the arts, up to somewhere between $40,000 and $58,000 now. She was the first person in her family to enter university, in 1988, the last time the youth employment rate was as high as it is now. As a young woman from a single-parent, low-income family, she said the cost of a uni degree then was a huge pressure and that her degree cost a third of the cost proposed in this legislation. She said Commonwealth funding enabled her to commence an arts degree before ultimately completing a bachelor of media, a diploma of education, a masters degree and a PhD. Well done! She said that this path out of low SES, out of limited prospects and out of a very small understanding of the world only occurred due to those first two years of a bachelor of arts degree. Now a mother herself, she fears what these changes will mean for her daughter. She told me: 'The hopes I have for her future, like the hopes of many parents, come from a hope that the country she is growing up in values education, not just for job outcomes but because all young people deserve access to education that broadens their mind and enriches their potential to contribute to their communities.' How right she is. The government has got this wrong and so many families in my community know it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  This construction-led recovery is well underway in the great city of Townsville. As the Prime Minister has said, and the budget very clearly highlights, infrastructure—commercial and residential construction—is going to be extremely important in helping rebuild our economy as we recover from COVID-19. In my electorate, this is already occurring. We are already in recovery mode. Our local economy has been suffering since the loss of jobs, since QNI closed and since the one-in-500-years flood event that happened recently. We'd already made over a billion dollars worth of commitments in the area to help create jobs and to build the roads and infrastructure our community needs. As we look to emerge stronger from the latest challenge, we have added incentives like HomeBuilder and JobMaker to get the cogs turning again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Treasurer said, this is all about jobs, jobs and more jobs. That's why I was extremely happy to read some figures put out by industry body Construction Skills Queensland. According to CSQ, there is about $1.8 billion worth of construction work underway in the Townsville, North Queensland region right now, and $2.3 billion worth of committed major projects in the region. That is a huge amount of both public and private investment into the region. What's more important is how that translates into employment. This work, over the next year alone, is going to generate more than 13,000 trade jobs. That's 13,000 people who will be working hard and earning a good wage. That will create a ripple effect through the rest of the local economy, as I've stated previously, whether it's from people buying coffee in the morning, getting a bacon-and-egg burger on the way to work or having a smoko down the road, or from people taking their loved one or family out to dinner. More jobs drive the economy, but they also generate more income and more money in their hip pocket. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSQ chief executive, Brett Schimming, told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Townsville Bulletin</span>: 'We are seeing a buoyancy coming to the construction industry here and we know construction will be central to the recovery from the pandemic. Townsville is looking very strong and healthy.' This is great news. You don't want to hear it from a politician, because most politicians will talk about how good their community is and, 'The jobs are going to be great.' We're listening to industry leaders. We're listening to the professionals who are on the ground, who have all the knowledge about how it is going to drive our economy. This is fantastic—more jobs, more people moving to Townsville, more money pumping through our great community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at the rental vacancy rates to see this playing out. The Real Estate Institute of Queensland has calculated that Townsville's vacancy rate is 1.7 per cent. That's compared to recent years when it's been seven per cent. This is great for our region. But make no mistake: this strong and healthy outlook is a direct result of the investments that we are making in both local infrastructure and the residential sector, and the hard work of the community. We are investing $35 million into the Cowboys community and high-performance centre. That is through $15 million in grants and $20 million through a NAIF loan. It's supporting more than 200 jobs during construction right now, and there will be more than 58 ongoing once it's operational. We've recently announced Riverway Drive, stage 2. This project—280 jobs. It's fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the best way to get out of the COVID recession is to keep people in jobs and to create that opportunity for employment. We want people to have confidence to take their loved ones out to dinner and to spend their money where they would like, and the people will lead us out of this. I thank everyone in Townsville for their hard work during the pandemic and everyone throughout the country who's doing it tough.</span>
