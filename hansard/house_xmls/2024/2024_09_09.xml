              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding Petition EN4414, requesting assistance for Australia's film and television industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The work of the Australian creative sector, including the film and television industry, is essential. It is essential to our community, what it is to be Australian, and to our economy. After extensive engagement and with the support of the Australian creative sector, I was pleased to release <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive: a place</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">for every st</span><span style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span style="font-style:italic;">y, a st</span><span style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">for every place </span>-Australia's cultural policy for the next five years, with the Prime Minister, the Hon Anthony Albanese MP on 30 Janua1y 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with <span style="font-style:italic;">Revive, </span>the Australian Government provides significant support to the Australian screen industry, recognising the important role it plays in shaping Australia's national identity. The Australian Screen Production Incentive is the Government's primary mechanism for providing support to the screen indust1y. It provides tax incentives for film, television and other screen production in Australia and is available in three streams:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Producer Offset, administered by Screen Australia, entitles a production company to a 40-per-cent rebate on qualifying Australian production expenditure on eligible feature films and 30 per cent on other formats (television, online, DVD) for productions with significant Australian content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Post, Digital and Visual Effects (PDV) Offset, administered by the Office for the Arts in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, provides a 30 per cent rebate on qualifying expenditure for productions undertaking PDV production in Australia. The expenditure threshold for eligibility is $500,000 expenditure on activities reasonably required to perform the PDV production in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Location Offset, administered by the Office for the Arts in my department, provides a 30 per cent rebate on qualifying Australian production expenditure for eligible productions with a minimum Australian spend of $20 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government announced the Location Offset will increase to 30 per cent from I July 2023 which delivers on the Government's commitment in Revive to encourage investment by large-budget screen productions in Australia. The Government has also since announced amendments to the Producer Offset, including the removal of both the 'above-the-line' cap of 20 per cent of total film expenditure and the minimal length requirements that apply to certain content formats. A new minimum expenditure threshold for drama series of $35 million per season in qualifying Australian expenditure has also been introduced to the Producer Offset, meaning a series that films significant numbers of hours over a season but does not meet the per hour threshold can now benefit from the offset.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will enhance Australia's competitive position in attracting large budget screen productions to film here and maintain our world-class reputation for filmmaking. They will also benefit the entire screen sector by providing greater employment and development opportunities for our skilled screen workers</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Children's Television Foundation (the Foundation) will also receive an additional $14.5 million over four years from 2024-25, and ongoing funding of $3.8 million per year from 2028-29. This increase in funding will allow the Foundation to continue to contribute to the development and funding of high-quality Australia children's content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures build on the significant support the Government already provides for the production of screen content in Australia. In 2023-24, a total of $878.6 million was invested in the Australian screen sector by the Government through direct funding or incentives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This support allows us to produce even more Australian stories told by Australians, and even more content filmed in Australia using the craft and skills of our dedicated screen professionals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Screen Australia is the Government's primary agency for supporting Australian film, television, documentary and digital media makers, through direct investment in screen development and production. Screen Australia offers funding to support the development, production and marketing of Australian screen content, as well as for the development of Australian talent and screen production businesses. More information is available at www.screenaustralia.gov.au/funding-and-support, or the agency can be contacted by email at info@screenaustralia.gov.au, or by phone on 02 8113 5800.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 24 November 2022, concerning Petition number EN4488—raise all income support payments to at least the Henderson poverty line. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding, which was due to an administrative oversight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Income support payments including JobSeeker Payments are designed to support Australians who are unable to support themselves whilst they look for a job or have a temporary injury or are incapacitated. Along with the basic rate of payment, everyone who receives a JobSeeker Payment are eligible for at least one additional supplementary payment which may include Energy Supplement, Family Tax Benefit or Rent Assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since this petition was signed, the Australian Government has overseen a number of increases to the JobSeeker Payment rate. In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government extended the higher rate of JobSeeker Payment and Energy Supplement to single recipients with an assessed partial capacity to work up to 14 hours per week so that those with barriers to employment who have limited or no capacity to work due to their condition will receive an additional $54.90 a fortnight. This was built on last year's Budget measures, which included increases to working age and student payments by at least $40 a fortnight, and the expansion of eligibility to Parenting Payment Single to single parents with a youngest child under 14 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of the $40 increase to working age and student payments announced in the 2023-24 Budget, together with indexation, the JobSeeker Payment rate for single recipients without a dependent child has increased in nominal terms by $120 per fortnight, or 18.7 per cent, since May 2022. This is the largest nominal increase in a 2 year period ever and the largest in real terms (7.4 per cent) in more than 40 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To address the effects of inflation on the cost of living for those on income support payments such as JobSeeker Payment are increased twice yearly in line with the Consumer Price Index. In March 2024, the rate of JobSeeker Payment for a single recipient without dependent children increased to $771.50 a fortnight, including the Energy Supplement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not look at any single poverty measure in isolation but actively monitors trends and debates around poverty and disadvantage. While there are a number of different indicators of poverty and disadvantage that are commonly cited by researchers and organisations, there is no recognised official 'poverty line' in Australia. As such, the Government does not have a specific measure of poverty that accounts for cash or social transfers in kind. The foundation of the Australian social security system is a 'safety net' system of cash transfer payments to individuals aimed at preventing or alleviating poverty by ensuring access to a minimum standard of living.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises the very important issue of women's safety. The Government is providing the focus and national leadership needed to prevent violence and ensure appropriate support is available to people who need it, when they need it. The <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032 </span>(the National Plan) is a joint Australian, state and territory government document that sets the national policy agenda for addressing violence against women and children in Australia for the next 10 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the National Plan, the Australian, state and territory governments have collectively committed to the vision of ending gender-based violence in one generation. The National Plan is supported by the dedicated <span style="font-style:italic;">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Action Plan 2023-2025, </span>the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Action Plan 2023-2027, </span>the Activities Addendum to the First Action Plan, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Outcomes Framework 2023-2032, </span>setting the roadmap for how we will work to achieve this vision. More information about the work of the Australian, state and territory governments to end violence can be found at www.dss.gov.au/ending-violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the need to escalate collective efforts to end gender-based violence, the Prime Minister convened a National Cabinet on 1 May 2024, so that the Australian Government and all states and territories were able to come together on this critical issue. First Ministers agreed to build on and strengthen efforts currently underway under the National Plan, including strengthening accountability and consequences for perpetrators, strengthening and building on prevention work through targeted, evidence-based approaches and maintaining a focus on missing and murdered First Nations women and children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government has invested a further $1.1 billion towards ending gender-based violence, bringing the government's total investment to $3.4 billion under the National Plan. This includes permanently establishing the Leaving Violence Program, a suite of online measures to address easy access to pornography for children and young people, tackle extreme online misogyny, a rapid review of targeted prevention approaches, an immediate funding boost to the legal assistance sector, the establishment of a National Student Ombudsman and extension of the First Nations Family Dispute Resolution Pilot.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 regarding Petition EN4764, concerning Screen Australia's support for independent productions in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2023-24, the Australian Government provided considerably more support for the domestic screen sector than to international productions. Out of the $878 million in support provided to the screen sector, over $573 million in financial support was provided to Australian local productions and to support and train local screen practitioners, while $305 million was provided to attract large budget international productions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Screen Australia is the Government's primary agency for supporting Australian film, television, documentary and digital media makers. It provides direct investment in screen development and production, and understands the importance of independent screen producers to the production ecosystem. Screen Australia provides support for a diverse slate of content across a range of formats and platforms to make sure that audiences have access to uniquely Australian screen stories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a portfolio agency, Screen Australia operates at arm's length from Government, and independently determines its funding scope and decisions. Screen Australia delivers funding and support in line with its enabling legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Screen Australia Act 2008, </span>as well as its Terms of Trade and individual program guidelines. It is only able to fund Australian production made by Australian companies. These documents are available on Screen Australia's website at www.screenaustralia.gov.au. Information on grants provided by Screen Australia is publicly available in Screen Australia's annual reports, located at www.screenaustralia.gov.au/about-us/corporate-documents/annual-reports.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Screen Australia Board members' obligations are outlined in a number of legal instruments, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Screen Australia Act 2008 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Governance, Pe</span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">formance and Accountability Act 2013. </span>Board members are also subject to Screen Australia's Board Code of Conduct (which is consistent with the Australian Public Service's Code of Conduct and Values), as well as Screen Australia's Board Conflict of Interest Policy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Board members who have a material personal interest in a matter under consideration by the Board or the Audit Committee are required to declare that interest. A Board member with a material personal interest in a matter being considered by the Board is required to leave the meeting while the matter is considered and a decision is made and is not permitted to vote on other projects under consideration in the relevant board paper. Disclosure of such interests and departure from the meeting are recorded in the minutes of the meeting. The Manager, Governance is responsible for maintaining a register of Board members' interests, which is updated annually or as private interests are declared.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applicants may wish to raise any concerns they may have with Screen Australia through its complaints process. Under this process Screen Australia undertakes to resolve complaints quickly, and keep complainants informed of the progress of their complaints. Screen Australia can be contacted regarding a complaint on 02 8113 5800 or at complaints@screenaustralia.gov.au.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 March 2023 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition regarding funding for Trove (EN4791).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, the Australian Government has now secured the future for Trove.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the 2023-24 Budget, the Government is providing funding of $33 million over four years from l July 2023, with indexed and ongoing funding of $9.2 million per annum from 2027- 28 to support the continuation of Trove. This decision follows years of tempora1y funding under the former Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your hard work to ensure that millions of Australians can continue to access much of Australia's history through Trove.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for conveying a petition (EN5200) that calls on the House of Representatives to close the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Canberra. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has limited all bilateral cooperation with Russia since its illegal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine; our bilateral relationship is not 'business as usual'. We continue to condemn Russia's actions and are working closely with our international partners to impose significant economic and political costs on Russia and those supporting its invasion. This includes over 1,200 targeted financial sanctions and travel bans, as well as a comprehensive suite of trade measures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will always act firmly and consistently to protect our national security interests. For example, in June 2023, the Parliament enacted legislation to terminate Russia's lease over its site for a proposed new diplomatic presence in Yarralumla. This legislation denies Russia access to that site.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Despite its increasing isolation, Russia remains a global power with influence, including as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Keeping diplomatic channels open, even in the context of limited bilateral contact, is in Australia's interests. These channels enable us to convey our strong opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, condemn its reckless nuclear threats, and advocate for the interests of Australians. Notwithstanding this, the Australian Government has been clear that the number of accredited Russian diplomats in Australia should reflect our national interests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN6056 presented to the House of Representatives on 14 May 2024, regarding electric vehicle (EV) charging payment methods. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure Australian EV drivers have access to a convenient, reliable and affordable national charging network, Australia's Energy and Climate Change Ministers have agreed minimum operating standards for government-supported public EV charging infrastructure. The minimum operating standards give consideration to payment methods and require that all direct current (DC) fast chargers provide an option for contactless payment that supports credit and debit card transactions, does not require registration or app download prior to arriving at the charging station, and does not require a payee's mobile or internet signal. These requirements are based on the objective that consumers should be able to charge their vehicle and pay with ease, as they would for any other service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Government programs designed to support deployment of public charging infrastructure announced from 1 January 2024 require proponents to meet these nationally consistent standards, which are available to be read in full at www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/transport/ national-collaboration-evs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Emerging technologies may also support seamless payment options for EV charging without app registrations. For example, Plug and Charge technology allows an EV driver to plug in their car to a charging station with payment completed via secure communications between the vehicle and the charging infrastructure. Rather than relying on a card or external login, the charging station authenticates the car itself, and payment processing happens automatically.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The minimum operating standards will be reviewed annually by Commonwealth, state and territory governments to reflect technological and regulatory progress. Public feedback on the EV charging network, such as through the Petitions Committee, will contribute to this. The needs of Australian consumers are a key consideration for the Australian Government in designing future policy to support the decarbonisation of Australian transport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for raising this matter with me.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding petition EN6087, requesting to halt the construction of the windfarm in Geographe Bay. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The offshore wind industry is well established internationally and is now an emerging industry in Australia. It presents an opportunity to make use of an abundant clean energy resource—offshore wind is stronger and more consistent than onshore wind; offers large, year-round baseload generation capacity; and can replace energy provided by retiring coal fired power stations. Offshore wind can also be located close to areas of high energy demand. It is intended that offshore wind will work alongside other forms of renewable energy, such as solar and onshore wind, to secure Australia's energy supply, address climate change, fast track job and economic development opportunities for regional Australia and help us achieve net zero by 2050.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 February 2024, I proposed an area in the Indian Ocean off Bunbury, Western Australia for offshore renewable energy, including offshore wind, commencing 74 days of public consultation closing on 3 May 2024. During this time, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water held five community drop-in sessions in the region, attracting more than 1,000 attendees who were able to ask questions of staff from the offshore renewables and environment parts of the department, and from the Offshore Infrastructure Regulator. Departmental staff also engaged in extensive and ongoing consultation with the recreational and commercial fishing industry, First Nations representative bodies, and local business, with a mix of in-person and online meetings.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 3 June 2024 regarding petition EN6098, to stop all offshore wind turbine proposals and plans. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The offshore wind industry is well established internationally and is now an emerging industry in Australia. It presents an opportunity to make use of an abundant clean energy resource—offshore wind is stronger and more consistent than onshore wind; offers large, year-round baseload generation capacity; and can replace energy provided by retiring coal fired power stations. Offshore wind can also be located close to areas of high energy demand. It is intended that offshore wind will work alongside other forms of renewable energy, such as solar and onshore wind, to secure Australia's energy supply, address climate change, fast track job and economic development opportunities for regional Australia and help us achieve net zero by 2050.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 June 2024 regarding petition EN6189, which requests additional funding for the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to increase allowances and wages for AFP officers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges and deeply values the dedication and important work of the AFP in ensuring the safety and security of Australians. AFP officers undertake challenging work every day to keep our community safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2024, the AFP put forward a proposed <span style="font-style:italic;">AFP Enterprise Agreement 2024-27 </span>that included a pay rise of 11.2% over 3 years, which is in line with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Sector Workplace Relations Policy 2023 </span>that seeks to apply consistent conditions across Australian Public Sector agencies. The offer also included several new allowances and conditions to enhance remuneration and flexibility for AFP employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed Enterprise Agreement was not supported by the majority of the AFP workforce at the conclusion of the voting period on 31 May 2024. Following an internal workforce survey, AFP bargaining discussions recommenced in July 2024. I understand these discussions are ongoing.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the referral of petition EN6231 regarding Mr David McBride. The petition asks the House of Representatives to release Mr McBride and requests that protections be put in place to protect whistleblowers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 November 2023, Mr McBride pleaded guilty to charges relating to theft of Commonwealth prope1ty and unauthorised disclosure of information concerning military operations in Afghanistan. On 14 May 2024, the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court sentenced Mr McBride to 5 years and 8 months' imprisonment. The sentencing remarks indicate he will be eligible for parole consideration on 13 August 2026. Given the potential of appeal, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is delivering on its commitment to strengthen the Commonwealth public sector whistleblowing framework through a staged reform process. On 1 July 2023, priority amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 </span>(PID Act) came into effect, which ensured immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower framework were in place in time for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. These reforms implemented 21 of the 33 recommendations from the 2016 Review of the PID Act by Mr Philip Moss AM (Moss Review) as well as 4 recommendations from other parliamentary committee reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In late 2023, the Government consulted widely on a second stage of reforms, and is considering what further reforms are required to ensure Australia's public sector whistleblowing framework remains fit for purpose and accessible for public officials to repo1t wrongdoing. The second stage of refo1ms will consider the remaining recommendations of the Moss Review and other relevant reports and reviews, and is an opportunity to further improve the public sector whistleblowing framework by considering how to address the underlying complexity of the PID Act and what steps can be taken to provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers.</span>

I apologise for the considerable delay in response, which was caused by a combination of technical and filing issues which meant that your referral was only received by the Attorney-General's Department very recently. These issues have now been rectified.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports the right of states and territories to legislate with respect to voluntary assisted dying. On 13 December 2022, the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the <span style="font-style:italic;">Restoring Territory Rights Act 2022 </span>(Cth). This Act lifted the decades-long prohibition on the right of territories to exercise their right to self-determination as it related to voluntary assisted dying, which was introduced by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, </span>as referenced by the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All states now have operational voluntary assisted dying schemes. The Australian Capital Territory scheme will become operational in November 2025.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a country of immigrants, forged from the very first Australians who came to this ancient land more than 65,000 years ago. Since that time we have unfortunately wrestled with racial tensions. Those of us alive now are not responsible for white dispossession, but we live with its consequences. Despite many governments' efforts, we have not yet managed to right the wrongs inflicted on First Nations people at colonisation. Most recently, the Voice referendum was associated with a dramatic spike in racism and discrimination against First Nations Australians, resulting in an increase in Indigenous suicide rates across the country. In recent decades, our generosity to people seeking asylum in this country has also waned. We have falsely claimed that refugees have thrown their children into the sea and that they've lied about rape and violence visited upon them. We have abandoned them on foreign soil. We have detained them to the point where they suicide because we have robbed them of hope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The horror wrought by Hamas on 7 October 2023 resonated around the world. It forced Israel to defend itself from those attacks and to fight to retrieve its hostages. It left the Jewish diaspora shocked and traumatised by the unspeakable physical and sexual violence inflicted by Hamas. But the extent and the nature of the Israeli response in Gaza has been utterly heartbreaking. There have been many, many thousands of innocent lives lost—children, women, men, journalists, nurses, doctors, teachers and aid workers—with millions of desperate people repeatedly uprooted from their homes without safety, medicine, food and water. Gaza has been razed before a disbelieving and grieving world's eyes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, antisemitism has been a well-documented and increasing concern in Australia for many years, but things have recently worsened, and it to our great shame that in recent months Jewish citizens have, in many cases for the first time in their lives, felt discriminated against and targeted on the streets, in schools and on our university campuses. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that Australians feel safe. All Australians must feel safe, respected and free to profess their faith in their workplaces and in the streets. We have to all stand together against antisemitism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to recognise and respect the great sadness and anger felt by so many people about the terrible destruction and loss of life visited upon the people of Gaza. Those emotions have been amplified by feelings of helplessness in the face of an Israeli administration which seems intransigent to the urgings of governments, the UN and the International Court of Justice to halt the killing of innocents, to respect international law and to work for a sustained peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, our democratic and human rights based values have to include respect for artistic and academic freedom and the right to peaceful protest. Two things can be true at the same time. We can be horrified by the actions of Hamas but also devastated by the terrible tragedy of the devastation of Gaza. Like the hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who demonstrated against their government last week, we can support the State of Israel but not its government's actions against the civilian population of Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is to this country's shame that the distress felt by so many Australians about this terrible war has in many cases been stoked by rhetoric and wedge politics in this place. Politicians from the Left and from the Right have deliberately fomented dissent and anger at a time when we need reason and respect. Most Australians are generous and accepting. We want our leaders to watch their words and their actions, to provide a means of acknowledging differences and to acknowledge that both Indigenous and white Australians need to be able to feel that this wonderful island home is our home, that both Jewish and Muslim Australians can fairly and reasonably feel great grief and anxiety about the war in the Middle East and that we must continue to offer refuge to the dispossessed and the homeless. Our nation looks to our leaders to show compassion and mercy. We owe Australians nothing less. We are and will always be a country of immigrants, and we are better because of that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:07</span>):  I thank the member for Kooyong for bringing forward this motion in this place. There is a misconception out there that I often hear: that somehow Jewish community members in Australia want to see this war continue, that somehow the Jewish community want to see this terrible war go on and that they support all sorts of terrible things that are happening to the Palestinian people. It just could not be further from the truth. The truth is that this has been devastating, obviously, for people in the region, but it has also been devastating for communities right around the world, and the Jewish community in Australia has been at the point of the spear when it comes to the consequences and the pushback that we have seen as a result of this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think for a second of what we have become desensitised to in this country. Concerts by Jewish performers like Deborah Conway and performances by Jewish comedians have been invaded, as have Jewish community centres. People feel that that's appropriate. Last week, two Jewish boys at Caulfield Station were physically assaulted for being Jewish. I personally have had my office visited in the early hours of the morning by people who sought to cause damage. This has been, in my 37 years living in this country, one of the most devastating and awful times for the community that I am so proud to represent. No-one in the Jewish community in Australia wants this war to continue, and no-one wants to see the devastation, displacement or loss of life of Palestinian people. We are humans above all else, and we want to see dignity for all people, freedom for all people and a future for all people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the way we conduct ourselves in this place really matters. I wish we could click our fingers in the House of Representatives and cause the war to be over, but it is just not the case. What we can do is hold the nuanced, respectful, calm and measured debate that this country was built on—the respect for one another, the multiculturalism, the fact that we conduct political discussions in a way that respects each and every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not okay to point the finger at community groups and diaspora groups around the world. It's not okay to target Jewish community organisations if you somehow have views on the Middle East, because they are not the Israeli government. They are Australians, and, if you are targeting Jewish people in Australia because of your views on the Middle East, then you are crossing a line. In the same way, the Palestinian diaspora community and the Islamic diaspora community here in Australia are off limits. They are people who are worried about their family. They're worried about the future of their people, and they want to see a better life for their community as well. But they cannot be held responsible for the actions of Hamas, and they absolutely should not be held responsible for any of the devastation that we're seeing as part of this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're Australians, and we're Australians first. We need to remind ourselves that there needs to be space, as I believe the member for Kooyong outlined quite articulately. We are Australians, we are people and we have a shared humanity. We need to respect each other. I've seen people come into this place and say the most terrible things about the way in which we must be blamed for one another and that we must bring this conflict to Australia's shores and make it all about our political discourse. There are those in this place that have tried to do that, but that is the wrong approach. It will divide our communities and divide our country further. Rather, what we need to do in this place is to remind ourselves that each and every Australian and every minority group in Australia deserves to live with respect and dignity in our country and that social cohesion isn't just a term; it's a philosophy that we all must adhere to. It's a practice that we all must adhere to to ensure that each of us has a safe and respected place in Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen the destruction of social cohesion happening over the last 11 months, over people's opinions of the war, but we must be better than that. We must respect each other as this conflict hopefully comes to an end.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on this important issue, and I thank the member for Macnamara for his very important contribution. This motion calls for better political debate and for making sure that race and ethnicity are not used as a political tool in this place, especially when it comes to populist positioning. It's absolutely vital that we elevate the national debate in this place and call out when race and ethnicity are being used as a political tool to polarise a debate, often relying on misinformation. As democratic representatives, we should strive to provide leadership on difficult issues and learn, from history, of the danger of using division for political gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech to this place, in 2019, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While this may be a place of robust debate, it is time for a more respectful approach, and accountability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That remains as true today as it was five years ago, and, sadly, the tenor of the debate has too often not improved sufficiently and certainly not met the level that our communities expect. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the standard</span> report illustrated that we have a lot of work to do to reform the culture in this place. The Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, on which I sit, has worked diligently to implement the recommendations of <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">et the standard</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> and another key recommendation will be actioned this week with debate on the bill to establish the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, ultimately, culture has a way to go and can't just be about recommendations and reports. We've seen the implementation of the Stop it at the Start campaign, which seeks to tackle disrespect and asks young Australians to consider disrespect and to call it out. This is pivotal in this crisis of domestic violence that we have. But, as the member for Mackellar has said, we also need a campaign to stop it at the top. Disrespect starts with the leadership; it's given permission when leadership shows disrespect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago the level of noise, interjection and yelling that I and others experienced in this chamber was like nothing I've experienced in any professional environment. It was totally unacceptable. Many of us on the crossbench frequently experience that behaviour. It is unacceptable in any other workplace, as it should be in this place. Yelling, snide remarks, interruptions and even intimidating behaviour on the floor of the House during divisions—this is just incredibly unacceptable. Parliamentary behaviour needs to be modelled from the top, from party leaders, deputy leaders, senior government, shadow ministers and whips. Disrespect is not robust debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, I was seeking to bring a human face to the refugee debate, which in this place is too often based on misinformation and fearmongering. The opposition's motion sought to target vulnerable Palestinian refugees in a way that we have not targeted any other group fleeing a war zone. I was calling for a humanitarian response to a conflict, for people seeking safety. That issue, as the member for Kooyong and the member for Macnamara have identified, is tearing at the fabric of our social cohesion because it is so polarising and so raw and emotional, and it's so important that race and ethnicity are not used in such a situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to talk about racism in our society. Too often, calling out racism is castigated more than racist conduct itself. For those experiencing racism it is deeply traumatising and is a harmful experience. It harms social cohesion and it is a threat to national security. It's telling that those offended by racism being called out are too often not the ones who actually experience racism. We all pride ourselves on being part of a multicultural society, but, because of this multiculturalism and the celebration of it, many believe racism cannot possibly be a major issue, even if it probably exists, yet a major survey recently conducted by the ABC found that 76 per cent of Australians from a non-European background have experienced racial discrimination based on their ethnicity. We often rightly call out antisemitism and Islamophobia, as many contributors to this debate have identified, but too rarely do we call out racism, especially racist policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this is important. Policies that are inherently racist are designed to foster fear and hatred of a minority group, and the fear of the consequences of calling out that racism means the policy itself does not get examined and sufficiently called out, so I think this is important. I hope that we can move on to a more respectful debate in this place but also embrace our multiculturalism in more than just words alone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I want to acknowledge and thank the member for Kooyong for moving this motion on social cohesion. Since I was appointed the Special Envoy for Social Cohesion, apart from every problem in the country coming my way because the role was interpreted as having such a broad remit, a lot of people have asked me, 'What does social cohesion mean?' Put simply, it means our ability to interact with each other as individuals and engage with each other as members of groups or members of organisations, or as parts of institutions which are made up of people, in such a way that the interrelation and engagement is respectful and peaceful and that, even if there is difference and disagreement, we navigate through that without reverting to hate speech, vilification, violence and conflict, without stoking division. That's the essence of social cohesion, and, frankly, it is under threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many challenges that are fraying our social cohesion: socioeconomic disparity, intergenerational unfairness and, of course, political populism, at both ends of the spectrum, for short-term political gain. There is a stoking of division and there has been a creation of distrust in our democracy. And of course there's social media. There are great benefits in having digital technologies that allow access to digital communications, but we know that algorithms in social media tend to move towards pulling people apart and exacerbating division, discord and disharmony, and there are bad actors in our political and civil discourse who manipulate these platforms for that express purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we, as a government, and all of us here as parliamentarians in this place have a responsibility to be mindful that our language makes a difference and has an impact on our public life. So it was disappointing during even the last parliamentary sittings to see members of the opposition and members of minor political parties choose to do the opposite and instead stoke division and discord. Political leaders, rather than politicians, especially know that what they say has a real impact on people within society. Unfortunately, there are political actors—and they know who they are—that are not taking their responsibilities and their obligations seriously. Instead, for their own short-term political gain, they're contributing to that fraying of social cohesion and the distrust in our democracy, whether it's the Leader of the Opposition stoking division or the leader of the Greens who talks about how the political establishment is letting people down or is failing people. I would ask the leader of the Greens: hasn't he been part of the political establishment for the past 14 years as an elected member of this parliament? So, whether it's the opposition or the Greens or even the crossbench or the Labor Party, we all have a responsibility to our democracy, to not let it down, to not tear it down, to build it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament will always involve robust debate. It will. And that's a good thing. It's something we shouldn't shy away from. But robust debate and respectful debate are not mutually exclusive. I agree with that. In footy terms, play the ball, not the man or the woman. I wish Carlton did more of that on the weekend—</span>

                  </a>  The member for Kooyong knows they should have. It's crucial that as members of parliament we're doing everything we can to promote respect and social cohesion, not fan the flames of hate and division. There has to be a greater good-faith commitment to our society and to our democracy when we talk about social cohesion. Each of us, as political leaders—not politicians—or community leaders, business leaders or leaders in sports, has that obligation and responsibility to unite Australians, to bring people together, not to attack people based on their identity or their background or, as often happens in this place by certain actors, to spread misinformation and disinformation wilfully for short-term political gain. We've got to have that commitment and that obligation to the society we value so much.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a relatively harmonious and very cohesive multifaith and multi-ethnic pluralistic society, but it is under strain and it is under threat. We need to work together to protect it and enhance it from those challenges. Ultimately, in the end, this is really a moral question for all of us to answer: what commitment do we have to our communities and to our broader society? As parliamentarians, elected representatives here, we should have the highest level of commitment. There are normative and cultural behaviours that, as leaders, we must manifest. We must lead the way and be role models in order to achieve a more cohesive society.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pivotal moment came at the 1994 National Conference of the Australian Labor Party, where Labor women successfully championed the cause for gender equality in preselection processes.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I proudly stand as part of Australia's first female majority government, where diverse voices have enabled us to deliver meaningful change for women across the nation—from pay rises for feminised industries to real action to increase workforce participation, from support for women fleeing domestic violence to superannuation being paid on PPL. The legacy of affirmative action within the Labor Party is a testament to the perseverance and the dedication of countless women who paved the way for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While time constraints prevent me from acknowledging each individual, I must pay tribute to my predecessor in the electorate of Lalor, Julia Gillard, our first female Prime Minister, whose leadership paved the way for more women into politics and into this parliament. As a born and bred westie of Melbourne, I'm proud to be from a part of the world that is also home to glass-ceiling breakers such as Victoria's first female premier, Joan Kirner, and the first female attorney-general, Nicola Roxon. I also want to pay tribute to two remarkable women I am lucky to call not only colleagues but also friends: Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, who this year became the longest-serving female Labor member of parliament, and Minister Wong, who this year became the longest-serving female cabinet minister in Australian history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of affirmative action within the Labor Party is undeniable. In the 92 years between Federation and these reforms, only 28 Labor women had been elected to this parliament. In the 30 years since, 109 Labor women have been elected. That's three times the number of Labor women elected in less than a third of the time. If you look at our gender equal government, you will also see enhanced inclusion reflected in terms of faith, ethnicity and prior life experience, because if you break one ceiling, you break others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate the progress made within our own ranks, it is disheartening to see fewer women on the coalition benches than when I joined this parliament. In fact, while Labor has gone from strength to strength since 1994, in this parliament the Liberal Party has recorded its lowest female representation since 1993, something that disheartens us on this side. It is a stark reminder that the fight for gender equality is far from over.</span>

In case anyone needs reminding, a woman's place is in the House and in the Senate. I commend this motion to this House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I rise very happily to second this motion moved by my good friend and fierce advocate for Labor women, the member for Lalor. I stand very proudly as a Labor woman elected to this parliament and a member of Australia's first ever female majority government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This significant milestone in our nation's history didn't happen overnight and didn't happen by accident. Almost 30 years ago, on 26 September 1994, only 32 of Australia's then 225 parliamentarians were women and women made up only 14 per cent of the federal parliamentary Labor caucus. That's when the Australian Labor Party made the historic decision to introduce quotas for women. Affirmative action quotas were designed to give more opportunities to women, build our capacity at all levels and improve the culture of politics within the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first quota was set at 35 per cent for women to be preselected into the held and winnable seats. Crucially, at the same time it was agreed that there would be a sanction applied if this was not met. If the quota wasn't achieved, preselections would be overturned and the nomination process would start again. This sanction has been critical to the success of affirmative action, and it is closely protected to this day. In 2002 the quota was increased to 40 per cent by 2012. In 2015, we went to 50 per cent by 2025. Guess what? It is now 2024 and we've smashed that target. We smashed it two years ago. Every time we've set a target, Labor has exceeded it and delivered it ahead of time. We know that quotas work. The evidence is there for everyone to see. We have Australia's first female majority government and parliaments right across Australia are teaming with strong, smart, capable women making smart choices for Australia and for women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did affirmative action get more talented people elected but it changed the culture of our party for the better too. It also changed the outlook for Australian women. Labor governments have always worked hard for women, and we are proud of the decades of accomplishments. They're too long to list them all, but we value people who work in the care economy these days, we are improving women's safety, we've addressed a stubborn gender pay gap in this country that existed for so long, we have a strategy to address gender inequality in Australia for the first time in our history, and we've made women's health a priority. We know that there's much more to do, and that's why we've got a laser focus on gender equity in this nation, and we are committed to working hard every single day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I mentioned, women's participation in politics didn't just happen overnight, and neither did that list of achievements. They came off the back of decades of hard work by so many women that came before us. There were women like Dorothy Tangney, the first Labor woman to be elected into the federal parliament in 1943 and the first woman in the Senate; Joan Child, who was the first deputy speaker in 1984 and the first female Speaker in 1986; Julia Gillard, Australia's first and to date only female Prime Minister; and, in this 47th Parliament, Linda Burney, who became the first Indigenous woman to be elected into the House of Representatives in 2016; and Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, who was first elected in 1998 and is the longest-serving woman in this House. There are many in the other house, of course, with a lot of firsts as well, but these are just a few of our Labor women firsts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things we are proud of. We do not take them for granted, however. We know that the women who worked so hard to pave the way before us—all of those Labor firsts and all of those Labor women champions that worked behind the scenes—would never stop and rest up, thinking: 'Oh, job done! We can all go and rest now!' We know this not to be true. We are forever vigilant about the issues of gender equality in our parliament, in our party and in our nation, because women's representation matters. It strengthens our communities and it strengthens our democracies. We know as Labor women our place is not simply in the House and the Senate. It's in the cabinet and it's in every place where decisions are made. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I am very pleased to speak on the Chief Government Whip's motion in this place, because it is an important motion. This place needs to reflect the diversity, the wonderful mixture that is Australian society. But, more than that, this place should be a beacon of equality and opportunity. The Labor Party has made decisions over the last decades to ensure that we achieve that, and obviously we have more work to do. But I also want to say this: as a male member of the Labor Party it is important that we are also a part of ensuring that institutions like the Labor Party have opportunities and are seeking talent from all different corners of our society, because if we do not have the inherent structures like quota systems then what will happen is the inherent biases that live within each of us will rise to the top. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all look for ourselves in representation. We all look for ourselves to try and pursue all of the opportunities in this place and in different institutions. But the Labor Party has made a different choice thanks to the strong and fierce women that have made up the leadership of our party and that make up the rank and file of our party as well. They said that we can't just look like we have done for the last 100 years; we need to look in new places and we need to ensure that women are better represented and are a part of the decision-making of our party. We know what it looks like if we don't do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't create the opportunities and the quotas and the structures where we actually seek out and lift the talent and provide opportunity, and find talented, smart and fierce women to be a part of our structures, what does that look like? It looks like the modern Liberal Party. Not one Liberal Party member is speaking on this motion. And, despite the fact that there are smart, talented Liberal women who should be promoted, each and every time there are inherent biases that the preselectors of the Liberal Party choose to hold onto as opposed to ensuring that there is a quota system of women. I know that there are Liberal Party women who are pushing for change. I think that that is an important thing, and it mustn't be an easy task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fact that quotas not only work but remove the ability to apply those inherent biases that, frankly, the blokes of the Labor Party were looking at for too long. They ensure that people are given opportunity when they should be. People like to talk about merit. I am proud of the merit that we have on this side. We have such fierce, smart, strong and articulate colleagues who are representing their communities and fighting for policies that make our country stronger. The fact that we have set targets to achieve gender equity makes our party stronger. It makes our party stronger because we see more of what the Australian people need. We, as the Labor Party, are not at our best if we have big blind spots. How can you seek to represent the population if half your representatives do not reflect that? How can we seek opportunity for the Australian people and for Australian women if we are not even willing to provide opportunities to Labor women to rise through the ranks and become senior members of our party? But that is not the choice that we made. It isn't just because of these quota systems that that has happened; it is because of the tireless effort of strong, fierce and smart Labor women over decades and of party structures committed to the promotion and the equity that we seek for Labor women and for all women in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am proud to stand alongside a caucus where over half of us are women representing over half the population. That is how it should be, because we cannot be what we cannot see. Without that we cannot be the party that is there to promote things and policies like ensuring that women are able to return to the workforce or that their pay is on an equitable basis to that of men. We have to be better than that, and where it starts is in our own backyard. Affirmative action works. We are proud of our equity, and I'm proud to be a member of a party that has promoted so many amazing women.</span>

If you can just bear with me while I am briefly self-indulgent, I graduated from university with a degree in mechanical engineering, which I am incredibly proud of, and I have always considered myself to be an engineer first and foremost. Of course, back then there were significantly fewer women undertaking engineering studies than there are now. There's been some movement but clearly not enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent my entire life working in male dominated industries and fighting to make sure that women are treated equally and given the opportunities that boys and men have. That was clearly a much easier task in engineering because, if you could do the work, it was not an issue. When you went onto the factory floor, you were treated equally based on your ability to do the job. As I moved through my second career, which was in industrial relations, I experienced similar issues to those I had experienced in engineering, where, as long as I could do the job, I was generally accepted and allowed to do what I needed to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My third career has been—is—politics. When I first was elected as the member for McPherson, there were clearly discussions about making sure that there was greater representation of women in parliament, and issues of quotas or targets have been discussed by the coalition for many, many years. Initially I have to say: I have always been opposed to quotas, because I never wanted to be considered to have been appointed into a role for any reason other than my ability to do the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have seen over the last decade at least has made me soften my views on opposing quotas. My concern is that the parliament of Australia needs to be a parliament that truly reflects the people of Australia, and that means that there are a number of groups, for want of a better way of describing them, that need representation within the parliament. One significant group is women, and, when I look at this side of the House and I look at the female representation that we have here, I am absolutely convinced that we need to do better. We need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to promote this as a workplace that is desirable for women to enter. We need to promote it, from the coalition's point of view, in my view, as a welcoming place for women to be part of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically, we have always been of the view that you get preselected based on merit, but sometimes you look around and you think, 'Well, maybe merit only applies in certain circumstances!' and that, basically, 'merit' and the appointment of people 'on merit' are often used to stop women from progressing. So what I would like to see is that there is an openness to and an understanding of the issues that we face. One of those is to make sure that we recognise that there is a need to ensure that we have more women sitting in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have stated publicly on many occasions that I think that the preselection processes of my own party need to be looked at to make sure that there is opportunity for all people to put their hands up to be preselected as a member of this parliament and to represent a political party if they choose to do so or, if they choose, to be an Independent. What I have said before and I say again is that, if we want to make change here, we cannot simply cross our fingers and hope that things are going to change without us taking positive action, because doing that in the past has been an abject failure.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  Affirmative action is more straightforward and powerful than we might think. Action to affirm the rights, abilities and potential of all human beings makes a better Australia and a better world for everybody. Some people are lucky enough to get affirmative action from birth—and I consider myself lucky in that way. They receive encouragement, and pathways to achievement are clear and open to them. But there are those who are given very different messages and very rocky roads. When they are discouraged, we all lose. We need people of ability with contributions to make to be speaking and doing so loud and clear, not muttering in corners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For centuries, women were told that the halls of power were not for them, unless they happened to be born into a ruling family—and even then, a male was almost always preferred. All sorts of decisions were made without hearing or even considering women's opinions or perspectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty years ago, our party, the Australian Labor Party, decided that waiting for this to improve wasn't good enough; it was time to act. That's always been a fundamental Labor principle: we don't sit around telling Australians that it will all work out in the end, in some mysterious way; we take action. It is our job and our responsibility. Successful people everywhere know that you have to set goals and targets along the way. Any person with a dream needs a plan to make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a different world back in 1994. The first goal then was to have a female candidate in 35 per cent of all held and winnable seats by 2002. Labor achieved that in 2004. But we were already on the move with a new goal. Back in 2002, we understood there was no going back. The answer was more determination and higher goals. We decided then that, by 2012, 40 per cent of held and winnable seats should have female candidates. After the federal election of 2013, 40 per cent of the Labor caucus were women. This was a percentage to be dreamed of by most parties in most nations around the world, and there was plenty who dismissed it as silly—an impossible dream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the ALP national conference adopted a new target: half of all our MPs and senators should be women by 2025, and that was achieved at the election of 2022. It is difficult to say this without strong personal emotion because I was one of those new members of parliament who are part of this great milestone. I want all women, all the students up there in the gallery, whatever your political views and allegiances, to be able to experience the intense mixture of emotions of being sworn in here to serve this country. It's a profound sense of duty and responsibility that is almost overwhelming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being part of a group of women now representing the people of Australia on equal terms for the first time is thrilling. For Labor this is happening in parliaments across the land. Now 50.2 per cent of all Labor members of parliament are women. Would it have happened anyway, just part of an ordinary everyday evolution? Well, let's see. We don't have far to look, just across the chamber. The Liberal Party in this parliament, sadly, is going backwards with its lowest percentage of female representation in 30 years. How can I say this gently? You are heading the wrong way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March this year Labor launched Working for Women, a strategy for gender equality. The strategy has goals and targets in five priority areas: women's safety, valuing care, women's economic equality, health, and decision-making and leadership. It is not a set of feel-good words; it is a statement of commitments with a track record to prove they can and will be achieved. Already the consequences of achieving parity are self-evident. The conversations change, priorities shift and funding gets committed. Here is just a sample of what can be achieved in two years: pay increases in industries overwhelmingly dominated by women, including in aged care; a tax cut for every female taxpayer, with 90 per cent of women now better off; modernising and expanding paid parental leave to 26 weeks by 2025; cheaper child care—families to have more choice over their childcare arrangements; a $56.1 million women's health package, with 22 endometriosis clinics now open; a $4.7 billion national plan for preventing family violence; and 10 days paid domestic violence leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent the electorate of Hasluck—all, not just 50 per cent. I am proud to say that, thanks to affirmative action, the debate about whether women should be reflected in this place as proportionate representation in parliament is done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I stand on the shoulders of my sisters, and I would like to thank the member for Lalor for bringing this important motion to the House. It is important to celebrate the wins and the significant progress we have made. On 26 September 2024, we will celebrate 30 years since the Australian Labor Party implemented affirmative action quotas for women in winnable seats. In my mind, people see quotas as a dirty word but I see it as setting a smart goal—specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. That is clearly what we have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1994 we set a target of 35 per cent women candidates and we met that target, so, in 2002, the target was raised to 40 per cent by 2012 and again we met the target. Then, in 2015, we set the ambitious target of 50 per cent by 2025 and we smashed that glass ceiling ahead of time. I am proud to be part of a women-majority government. For the first time in Australian history, 50.2 per cent of all Labor members in the Australian parliament are women. And I am also proud to stand here as the first female member for Swan in 101 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we stand on the shoulders of our sisters, and we owe so much to trailblazers like Jenny Macklin, the first woman to become the deputy leader of a majority party, and Julia Gillard, who made history not only as the first female deputy prime minister but as Australia's first female prime minister in 2010. I'd also like to recognise Senator Penny Wong, who, in 2013, became the first woman to serve as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and the first female Leader of the Government in the Senate. These women not only broke barriers but continue to inspire and lead the next generation of women in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I had the privilege of hosting a round table of women in my electorate with Senator Penny Wong. She met with local leaders who were recognised at the 2024 Swan International Women's Day Awards. As the first female member for Swan, I wanted to recognise the amazing women in the seat of Swan, and this included Michele Burton from the Perth Football Club; Dr Parwinder Kaur, a DNA scientist; Chloe Perez, a high school student; Maryann Tsai from Reach Her; Sobia Shah from Professional Migrant Women's Network; Joan Sutherland from the Haven; and Alicia Curtis from 100 Women. Senator Wong spoke about quiet courage, the behind-the-scenes work that often goes unnoticed yet is essential for change, and that's why I wanted to recognise these amazing women on International Women's Day—for their quiet courage and relentless work to make our community a better place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I also want to acknowledge the quiet courage in the context of affirmative action. I want to recognise the rank-and-file women—the women in Labor branches and on conference floors—who fought for these changes when I was 14 years old so that, 30 years later at the age of 44, I'd get to stand here and be a part of this majority female caucus. They had difficult conversations, they showed up when it mattered and they found talented women to run. It wasn't easy; it was hard, but they fought the good fight. Men and women worked together with quiet courage to lay the foundation of where we stand today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember when I ran for preselection for the first time and I met a woman called Sue Bowers. She had known me for 10 minutes, but her support for me was astounding, and it left a profound effect on me. What it made me realise is that there are people that will use their power to raise your voice and to elevate you, and that's what we are doing here as members of the government. We want to raise the voices of women to make sure that we make meaningful change for all the women in our electorate. Standing alongside our allies in the Labor Party, we will continue to raise the voices of women and work towards a more equal and just society, and this will be reflected in every decision that we make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate this 30-year milestone, let us honour the pioneering women who led the charge of affirmative action and recommit our belief that a woman's place, without question, is in the House, in the Senate and in the cabinet. I fully support this motion, and I encourage every member of the House to do so.</span>

                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  Thank you to the member for Lalor, the second woman to hold that seat, for bringing this important motion to the House today. In 1994, at a Labor conference in Hobart, something remarkable happened: history was made when the party rules were changed to include affirmative action targets for the first time, which were initially set at 35 per cent. It's incredible, too, that one of the people present and a fierce advocate for the rule change, Julia Gillard, would become the first woman member for Lalor and, of course, the first female prime minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time, there have been adjustments to the quota, and I'm pleased to have played a very small part in working with women in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and as a conference delegate to advocate for an increase to these targets. When we set targets, we met them, which shows that quotas work and that, if political parties are serious about gender equality and party rooms that look like our communities, then this is a path that should be pursued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal parliamentary Labor Party has met every quota and target set ahead of schedule since their adoptions, including 35 per cent initially, then 40 per cent and then 50 per cent. We now have a government comprising more than 50 per cent women. This did not happen by accident. It happened because of the hard work of so many women who have contributed to the Australian Labor Party. While it was the achievement of those who were there at that conference 30 years ago, when that affirmative action was implemented in our party rules, the contributions of so many others—many of whom history has failed to record or remember—led to that change being possible at that point in time, too. I want to acknowledge some of those unsung heroines in our party's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because we are a party of the collective and of struggle, we know that we work together through hard times as well as good to realise meaningful change. This change—affirmative action—has meant that our government now resembles the communities we represent in this place, which is vital for a model of government and parliament like ours in Australia. In my first speech I spoke about Joan Child, the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives, as well as the first Labor woman to be elected to this place. I've always found it absolutely staggering that it took until 1974 for that achievement to be realised upon her election as the Labor member for Henty. It took too long. That 20 years after that we could implement affirmative action and that 30 years later we can now say we have a majority female government shows that change can start slowly but that a small step can turn into large strides. It is an honour to be part of a Labor government and a Labor Party that places gender equality at the heart of all that we do so that our communities and our country are reflected in this place and that the doors of opportunity are open to everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender equality in representative politics is meaningful. It delivers paid parental leave, measures to close the gender pay gap such as paying workers in female-dominated sectors a fair wage, and having an equal-pay principle at the heart of our industrial relations system. It delivers cheaper early education and care so that more women can make the decision to enter or re-enter the workforce. It delivers a focus on women's health, on workplaces where women are respected, equal and safe and legislated accountability when they are not. This is scratching the surface. A gender lens on the budget and on legislation means that we have better legislation and better spending programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the work is not done. There's so much to do so that the horrific rates of gendered violence are reduced and eventually eliminated. We need to do more to address the gender pay gap, particularly its impacts on women in retirement. We need to make sure that women are more-equally represented in all sectors and at decision-making tables, that there is intersectionality in that representation, and that we see women from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences playing a part in decision-making processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is important to pause to note the achievements made so far. I am so grateful to the work of the many women, including Julia Gillard, who delivered our affirmative action rules, and it is a privilege to mark 30 years of affirmative action as a member of the House of Representatives. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I acknowledge the significant contribution from the member for McPherson today. I can only imagine the discussions and debates that are happening in your party room around this issue. I think it's important that, given your extensive experience in male-dominated work places, you are such a strong voice not only in this place but also outside of here on the importance of greater female representation. I applaud you and I hope that, for the sake of our parliament, the arguments you make are persuasive to your party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to celebrate 30 years of affirmative action in the Labor Party. I know that it was a hotly contested debate and I can't imagine how difficult some of those discussions would have been for the women who have come before me. To the member for McPherson, I hope you keep having those discussions, because I imagine that the path that you pave in your party room will help women who come after you, as they have helped me within the Labor Party. I have no doubt that me being a federal member of parliament, representing the Labor Party, was only possible because of the women who were brave enough to be part of those discussions more than 30 years ago. It is because of them that the party truly recognises the important role that women have to play as elected representatives. I am indebted to them and really grateful that we have this opportunity to celebrate the amazing work that they have done and the achievements that have come after them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest achievement is one that I get to be part of, and that is a majority female federal government, the first in our country's history. That I get to be part of that brings me such joy, and it's something that I will truly treasure. When I look around the benches here, I see that I am surrounded by some incredible female members of this caucus. It is amazing what has been achieved as a result of having the first majority female federal government. For us, on this side of the House, it's not enough to have more women in this place; it's about what we then do with that. It has been extraordinary to see the incredible strides that we have been able to take on the point of gender equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to look at one policy issue in particular, and that is around the government paid parental leave scheme. This scheme was introduced more than a decade ago by a Labor government, and it has taken a Labor government to improve that scheme. I benefited from the first government paid parental leave scheme when I had my son eight years ago, and it's with great pride that I now am in a government that is helping to improve that paid parental leave scheme. We are increasing it to 26 weeks by 2026. Importantly, there is a provision in there where we have set aside a portion of that paid parental leave scheme to be used by the other parent, to really encourage fathers to step up and take a greater parenting role. That's the point of having more female representatives—it is not just good for women; it is good for our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are big societal shifts that are happening, and I think good governments reflect what is happening in society. I want to give you one example of that. On International Women's Day this year I went to a construction company in my electorate; they had invited me to speak there. I talked about the fact that we have this newly improved paid parental leave scheme. A man put his hand up and said, 'When my daughter was born, I took an entire year off to look after her, and it was the best year of my life.' So these shifts in society are happening. Good governments reflect that change, and that's exactly what we're doing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  26 September marks 30 years since the Australian Labor Party adopted affirmative action quotas for women to be preselected as candidates in held and winnable seats. I'm very pleased to be standing here as part of a majority female government caucus. Every quota and target since their adoption by the party has been met. In 1994, the ALP National Conference set a quota of 35 per cent female candidates by 2002. The caucus was made up of 35 per cent women following the 2004 election. In 2002, this was lifted to 40 per cent by 2012, and we hit that in the 2013 election. In 2015, the ALP National Conference adopted a target of 50 per cent women MPs and senators by 2025, and this was achieved at the 2022 election. The federal caucus is currently around 53 per cent female, and across the parliaments of Australia 50.2 per cent of all Labor elected members of parliament are women. We look like the communities that we represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This stands in contrast to the parties that form the coalition, with the Liberals at 33.2 per cent, the Nationals at 33.3 per cent and the Leader of the Opposition's own party, the LNP, at just 17.6 per cent. Indeed, the Liberal Party, in the 47th parliament, have recorded their lowest female representation in parliament since 1993, and it's gone backwards since 2015, when they set a target of 50 per cent female representation. I think it's telling and, frankly, sad that no members of those parties opposite chose to speak on this important matter today. I hope that they're sitting in their offices—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's commitment has led to a history of firsts for women: the first woman to be deputy leader of a major party, former member for Jagajaga Jenny Macklin; the first woman to be Deputy Prime Minister, Prime Minister and leader of a major party, former member for Lalor Julia Gillard; the first woman to be Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Leader of the Government in the Senate, and the longest-serving female cabinet minister, Senator Penny Wong; the longest-serving woman elected to federal parliament, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek; the first Indigenous woman elected to the Senate, former senator Nova Peris; the first Indigenous woman elected to the House of Representatives, the member for Barton, Linda Burney; and the first female Attorney-General, former member for Gellibrand Nicola Roxon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Labor Party, I'm pleased to say that the debate about whether and how to include women is done. Around our table, over 50 per cent of us are women, and there is 100 per cent support for making sure we continue to include talented, experienced women in every aspect of life and in all of our policies. The key to this change over time has been affirmative action applying to all positions within the party: conferences, administrative committees, party office positions and candidates for public office. It is a broad culture change across the party that has delivered a better outcome. You won't achieve more women in public office without giving women more opportunity, experience and exposure at those other positions within the party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arguably, better representation at the parliamentary level has delivered better outcomes for women, who make up 51 per cent of the population across the country. We have a record low gender pay gap of 11.5 per cent. Of course, the correct gender pay gap is zero, but the downward trend is as a result of deliberate policies implemented by this government, and they've delivered some welcome results: cheaper child care, paid domestic violence leave, pay rises for minimum-wage workers and low-paid feminised industries, the expansion of paid parental leave, fairer tax cuts that left 90 per cent of women better off and prac payments for nursing, midwifery, teaching and social work students, the majority of whom are female. We've opened 22 endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics across Australia for the one in seven women who suffer from this debilitating condition, and, of course, we have a gender lens on the entire budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we recognise the amazing gains that the commitment to affirmative action in the Labor Party has delivered, we recognise that we still have a long way to go in the broader society. But I'd like to thank those members from 30 years ago who recognised the problem—representation—and did something about it. Women belong in the House, in the Senate and in the cabinet, and I'd encourage those opposite to do the same.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen, under this Labor government, that our economy is in trouble. Last week's national account figures revealed our slowest GDP growth since the 1990s, excluding the pandemic. We have faced the sixth consecutive quarter of negative GDP per person growth and are currently in the longest per capita recession in 50 years. In response to these dire economic outcomes, we've seen a failure to act from this Labor government. Instead, we've seen the Treasurer trying to blame everybody but himself or the government for the position the country currently finds itself in. This includes trying to blame the Reserve Bank, when last week the Treasurer outlined what he believed interest rates were doing to the economy. But the RBA has only one lever to pull in relation to inflation when it's out of control, and that is to increase interest rates. When the government of the day fails to act on an economic and inflationary crisis, the RBA is not left with much choice. I tend to agree with the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, who has previously stated that the only way interest rates can be reduced is through an improvement in our appalling productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving Australia's productivity must be front and centre in any national economic recovery debate. It is a key indicator of increases in our nation's economic welfare and prosperity. Unfortunately, since the last election, productivity has only gone in one direction under this government: backwards. Under this Labor government productivity has collapsed an incredible 6.3 per cent. That's an even further decline since the June 2024 national accounts highlighted in this motion, which had seen productivity fall by 5.2 per cent at that point. Things are clearly not improving under this government's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You may ask, 'What is this government doing to positively impact the economic conditions which have contributed to this decline?' Well, the simple answer to that is: very little to nothing at all. It has not only failed to act on economic policy; it is also adding fuel to the fire by burdening business with further regulation, red tape and cost. Labor's failure on the industrial relations legislation has caused many businesses to rethink expansion and investment efforts, delaying or cancelling projects which would have seen funds directed to improving efficiency or enhancing growth. In turn, this decline in business investment confidence and dynamism has slowed the rate of innovation and technology adoption by firms, which on a broader scale slows the nation's ability to increase productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past couple of weeks I've been talking to business people around my electorate. There's a significant degree of pessimism about the future direction of our economy. They certainly had nothing positive to say about the current government. I got an email in the last week or so from one of my textile businesses, a long-term business who has had a lot of work to do with Defence, and they've advised me that, in part but not entirely due to the cost of gas going up, the cost of additional regulation and the lack of proactivity from Defence procurement in the fields that they work in in textiles for defence, they are shutting up shop at the end of October. Not only that, but they also advised that another textile manufacturer for Defence, Wax Converters Textiles, have also just gone into administration. Technical Fabric Services, Wax Converters Textiles and other businesses in this country who should be supplying Australian-made clothing to our defence forces are going out of business because of this government's failure to get proper processes and systems in place to order the kit and equipment the Australian Defence Force needs. What is the difference, and what is the opportunity? That is a coalition government that will work on improving productivity and delivering for Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for kicking off proceedings with this motion, because it's always good to start the week with a good laugh. It's certainly laughable that he can be part of a government for 10 years that saw productivity stagnate. In fact, the former government was in charge of the worst decade of productivity growth in more than half a century. No wonder he's slinking out of the chamber. Their only contribution to productivity growth—and I'm sure the minister would recall—was red tape day, and then they cut that. Remember that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their war on commas and semicolons ended because cutting was their only productivity option—cut, cut, cut. When we look back at the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison conga line all we see are missed opportunities and misplaced priorities that had nothing to do with boosting productivity growth. They were scary days for commas, but there was nothing in terms of fair dinkum productivity. They grabbed our economy and drove it like they stole it, and we're still paying for that crazy joy ride. The former government left behind a nation struggling to catch up, and the Albanese Labor government inherited an almighty mess to clean up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A quick pointer for the opposition: do you know how you boost productivity? You invest in people. I know that the only renewable resource they believe in is ignorance, but we believe in the Australian people. Over the decade to 2020 the average annual labour productivity growth in Australia was the slowest in 60 years, falling to just 1.1 per cent compared to 1.8 per cent over the 60 years prior to that, basically. Inheriting the slowest labour productivity growth in 60 years isn't something that can be turned around overnight. It will take more than one term—plenty for the new member for Moreton, Jules Campbell, to work on when she comes in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, Labor are also making substantial progress with our responsible reforms in reversing the damage done to our economy. While labour productivity was flat in the March quarter, previous quarters started to show some positive movement. It grew 0.5 per cent in the December quarter at the end of last year and 1.1 per cent in the September quarter before that. So we acknowledge that there's work to be done, but our drive to boost productivity rests on investing in new industries, implementing better functioning markets, boosting competition and boosting child care so that more parents can return to the workforce earlier—some of the lowest hanging productivity gains in our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, Labor is also focusing on bolstering conditions and pay for hardworking Australians. Contrast this with the opposition, who want to make Australians work longer for less, via cuts. That's the LNP DNA. The Labor government knows that making Australians work harder for less money is not the answer here or in any situation. The Labor DNA is different. It's fairer and it's more equitable. Our approach combines strategic investment across a range of sectors—and investment in skills training is right up there; payments to every priority apprentice; opening up more fee-free TAFE for construction courses; upgrading our clean energy training infrastructure; and supporting women into male-dominated trades. When I go around to my businesses, the No. 1 concern that they have is l-a-b-o-u-r, finding bodies that are skilled and ready to work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's fee-free TAFE initiative has exceeded targets. Since January last year, half a million Australians have enrolled in courses that directly address high skills demands. Fee-free TAFE doesn't just address cost-of-living pressures; it provides workers to bolster productivity growth. We're also looking towards the future: a future made in Australia. We're harnessing our natural advantages—our natural resources, our thriving business sector, our diverse economy, a skilled and willing workforce, and strong trading relationships to create job security and prosperity for all Australians. A Future Made in Australia focuses on attracting private investment to drive the development and growth of future industries. In fact, business investment is now higher than it was during the mining boom. Labor's policies are helping to attract large investments and seamlessly enable them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, all of our focus rests on supporting workers. The opposition views workplace relations as just another opportunity to say no—no to safer workplaces, no to closing the gender pay gap. Cuts, cuts, cuts are all we've come to expect from a party led by a walking jeremiad and his echo acolytes. Labor's approach to workplace relations is to drive more agreements, not more conflict and division. It is why our IR package ensures that all workers can access minimum standards in their workplaces. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  I will miss the member for Moreton. I'll miss him terribly. He knows my personal regard for him, but there's much to be made of this particular speech. I will just take issue with one of the points made by the member for Moreton, and it might show the lack of economic clarity that this government has demonstrated. During our last term of government productivity growth was at 1.2 per cent. Under this government, it has gone backwards. It went backwards 6.3 per cent initially; it's now back up to about 5.2—a very small recovery. That's worse. Going up 1.2—that's improving. Going down is worse. So, when he makes the argument that there was some great problem under our side, just put some facts into it. To those in the gallery listening: 'Trust, but verify.' It's a great line from Ronald Reagan. Listen to this stuff, but then go and have a look at the facts. The RBA has all of this data; it's readily available to you. They talk to you about productivity, but it has gone backwards, at the greatest rate since we've measured productivity, under this government. That is an extraordinary statistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only that. We find ourselves in a time when the national accounts show the lowest growth, outside of the COVID period, since the nineties. We're in the sixth quarter of a GDP per capita recession, and, just to make things worse, to ram this down further, core inflation in Australia is higher than it is in every comparable economy around the world—in the US, the UK, Canada, Japan and the Euro area. We are in a really bad situation right now, and it is not a situation which can be pointed to as being some global phenomenon that is the result of—I don't know—Vladimir Putin over in Russia, or Houthi rebels in the straits over there, or the RBA. I'll get to the RBA, if they want to blame them more. To his eternal credit, the shadow Treasurer hasn't chosen to attack the RBA governor, and I think that's a wise move. At this point, I don't think these attacks will play out too well in the long run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in a terrible situation, and, if there were one metric by which you could genuinely address cost of living in Australia, it would be productivity. When we have productivity growth, we have real wage growth. To take an example of that, look at the mining sector. It's a highly productive industry and it has highly paid workers. The more productive it gets, the more it can pay its workers. That's how it works. And it's the same in an industry as it is across the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So you've got these incredible challenges weighing down Australia. The big question for government is: what do you do about it? Sadly, Labor has chosen, deliberately, a series of policies that have made our productivity numbers worse. When you put on an additional 36,000 public servants, all of whom are working at a lower productivity rate than those in the private sector, you will see productivity across the board go down. That's just how averages and numbers work. When you kill off a goldmine in a highly productive industry like mining, you are changing the balance—you are stopping that high-productivity work coming into the economy. That's what this government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've introduced IR legislation that every industry group across the country has slammed for attacking productivity. The Minerals Council of Australia, Master Builders, the BCA, COSBOA—everyone who has been asked on this issue has said: 'Yes, this legislation will make things worse.' When you introduce stuff like that, you are sending clear signals to the market: 'We are not interested in increasing productivity. That is not our focus.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government demonises casual employment, which is a choice that Australians make. Let's go back to the numbers. The conversion rate, when you force someone to go from casual to full time, is about nine per cent. That's the percentage of people who choose to go across. Nine per cent of casual workers choose to go to full-time employment, when forced on that question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a government that has taken a series of actions that have made things worse and will continue to make things worse. And this is on them. I would argue that, in these conditions—the biggest fall in productivity we've ever seen—these are the wrong choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will we do? We will support highly productive industries. We will support employees' choice of casual employment. We'll bring back the flexibility and simplicity to IR that have been stripped away by this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for this opportunity to speak on productivity growth in Australia, but I'd also quickly remind the member that declining productivity didn't happen overnight. It was inherited from a decade of Liberal-National inaction and missed opportunities—from a government that was more interested in entrenching low wages as a design feature of the economy. They won the gold medal for low productivity. We don't need these old canards about public servants versus contractors and consultants. We know the difference in how much money we are saving through the budget by returning public sector work to public servants. Just as this decline in productivity didn't suddenly happen when this government was elected, the solutions to turn this trend around will not suddenly undo decades of declining productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this Albanese government, we have a genuine focus on boosting productivity, whether it is through the energy transformation or whether it is technological change or human capital, particularly investing in skills not only to meet the great public policy challenges of our times but also to use such opportunities to make our economy more productive. The Albanese government understands productivity can grow when we address a few of the key factors that have constricted growth historically. Some of that starts with the bread-and-butter issues around unnecessary red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government announced this year we would invest $27.9 million over three years with ongoing funding of around $10 million per year to continue reducing red tape—an area that was left unfunded despite the rhetoric by the former Morrison government—so we can deliver reforms that make a difference for business and individuals. This investment will include making it quicker and easier for overseas health practitioners to come to Australia to work; streamlining and standardising requirements for national worker screening in disability, aged, children and veterans care sectors while maintaining safety for care recipients; improving Australia's food standards to enhance consumer food choices by reducing costs for both industry and government; the modernising of regulation and improving regulator performance, including greater use of data and digital technology in delivering government services, which leads to another key area of focus for this government: the utilisation of technology to improve productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year the Minister for Industry and Science released Australia's first national robotics strategy. Robotics and automation technologies have enormous potential to transform advanced manufacturing, supporting our transition to net zero, combatting workforce shortages and creating safer and more productive work environments for Australians. The strategy aims to support Australian industries developing and using robotics and automation technologies to strengthen competitiveness, boost productivity and support local communities. The strategy complements and is supported by the government's National Reconstruction Fund, Industry Growth Program and the Future Made in Australia, which seek to increase the commercialisation and adoption of critical technologies like robotics to support the growth of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's continued investment in the NBN will also underpin economic activity and productivity growth across Australia, helping businesses stay internationally competitive and consumers to stay connected. It is the type of infrastructure that needs to be properly invested in for its productivity gains to be realised yet, under the former governments, it was gutted to be done on the cheap. You simply cannot replace high-tech, high-quality fibre optic with copper wiring and not have consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government is not just focused on the technology and red tape that are holding back productivity; it has invested in the people behind our economy. For a labour market to be productive and contribute to a growing economy, it cannot be burning out. People must have eight hours of rest, eight hours of recreation and at least eight hours of work. Under the Albanese Labor government unemployment is at historic lows, wages are moving after a decade of stagnation, industrial action has fallen and the gender pay gap is at the lowest level on record. These are the strong foundations for a more productive economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made child care and early education cheaper, allowing parents to return to the workforce sooner, or free them up to pick up more shifts at work. But, as the Prime Minister has made clear, when people are loyal to their employer and focus on what they should be doing for eight hours a day—or longer if that is the agreed-upon shift—and not being distracted for 24 hours a day, you will get a more productive workforce. Productivity in this country had already plummeted under the former government, but, under this government, we are laying the foundations for a return to productivity with a plan to grow productivity in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I always enjoy listening to the member for Bean. He is someone that I do respect and do like. He is a good cricketer, and that is always nice as well. It was nice to hear him talk about technology. Technology is going to be crucial, so I hope he will join me in calling for the government to implement a minister for the digital economy. I've been calling for this since being elected. The previous coalition government had Senator Jane Hume, who was the minister for the digital economy. We had a plan, a strategy and a 2030 digital road map that was going to drive productivity. It was going to drive economic growth. It was going to help solve some of the challenges that we face as a nation, including high inflation. I hope the member for Bean and those opposite will join me in calling for the government and for Prime Minister Albanese to appoint a minister for the digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His decision, when elected, to have an Assistant Minister for the Republic but not a minister for the digital economy shows that his priorities are wrong and he doesn't understand a modern economy. The fact that he doesn't understand a modern economy is shown in our productivity being down eight per cent for this quarter. It has gone down 6.3 per cent under this government. When we talk about those numbers, they're important numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, productivity unlocks economic growth, and it keeps prices down. It does so because it's focused on the output for a business and offsetting their fixed and variable costs. If they're making more units per hour, it means the price stays lower. I was in those conversations prior to politics, when I was in business. We would look at our fixed and variable costs and our output, and that gave us our unit price that we then set with supermarkets and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in a world where interest rates have gone up 12 times under this government, where energy is up—over 14 per cent for electricity—and where insurance is going up. As all these costs and the cost of raw materials go up, the only way you can fight inflation, the only way you can bring prices down, is not to fight with the RBA governor; it's to have a strategy to increase productivity and unlock the strength of the private sector in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can talk about the numbers, but I want to share the stories behind this urgent need for productivity that the government refuse to address. I want to share a story from Claire from my electorate: 'I'm a mother of two adult children, married and nearing retirement. I live in Montrose, and I'm an active environmental volunteer. My youngest has just moved out of home, aged 23, and is finding it really difficult to afford groceries and rent, despite working full time in a well-paid job. Last week, he told me he hasn't been able to afford a block of cheese for three months, he uses Not Quite Right and other unbranded foods and doesn't get enough veggies to eat, relying on $1 tins of tomatoes and tinned beans being on special to make a healthy meal. When he was living at home we tried to prepare him for the challenges ahead, but he said he had no idea it would be this bad. Once I heard about my youngest not being able to afford a block of cheese, that's when I started buying him cheese and other staples. I never in my wildest dreams imagined I would need to help out our adult children with rent and food so they could remain housed and fed. This is not only their burden but mine too. At my age, it shouldn't be. I need to see real changes when I go to the checkout instead of exorbitant prices and no change at all.' Claire's story is one of thousands I could share from my community. This is the challenge people are having. And the way to bring prices down is through productivity. The way to bring interest rates down is not to fight with the RBA governor; it's to increase productivity. To quote the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock: 'The only way interest rates can be reduced is an improvement in our appalling productivity.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we don't hear about productivity. I commend the member for Forde for bringing this motion, because the government don't talk about productivity. They don't want to talk about productivity because they do not have a plan to increase it. It is going backwards—0.8 per cent, negative 6.3 per cent under this government. With the changes to the IR laws, it's getting harder and harder for business to have flexibility. Everyone wants workers to earn more, but it has to be at a sustainable level which is done through productivity growth. We see, with this government, that they've got a line for everything and a solution for nothing. The sad part is that it's those in Casey and in Australia that pay the price for this government's lack of action.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  Thank you very much, Chief Government Whip. I always appreciate your support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity is an incredibly important issue. Productivity fundamentally determines the long-run real growth rate in the Australian economy, and, more importantly, it determines the long-run change in the standards of living of Australians. So this topic is perhaps one of—if not, the most—important topics we could be discussing in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the premise of the proposition put by the opposition shows that, although productivity is an important issue, it is not one well understood by those opposite. The truth is they don't understand the current productivity issue Australia faces, they don't understand the causes of the current productivity problem and they have no solutions for how to address those problems in the future. Let 's go through each of these in turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, with respect to the current productivity issue that Australia faces, it is true that labour productivity in Australia has been weak. In fact, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual productivity bulletin 2024</span> put out by the Productivity Commission, they described labour productivity for the whole economy falling by 3.7 per cent in 2022-23. There's no question that this is a significant drop. For those opposite, the attribution of that drop, the causes of that drop, are all manner of gripes and grievances that they have; anything they can pin on the government's actions to attribute to that drop, they will do so. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between their rhetoric and the reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that all of the things that they accuse the government of doing to produce this productivity fall are not based in fact. Let me read to you the actual facts. This is from the Productivity Commission. They say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Labour productivity fell because output growth failed to keep pace with a record increase in hours worked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The decrease in labour productivity was a result of large increases in hours worked for the whole economy and market sector (both 6.9%). This increase in hours worked is unprecedented—the next highest growth rate on record was 4.3% for the whole economy—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">as far back as 1988. The Productivity Commission go on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The growth in hours worked outpaced growth in output for the whole economy—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">so the cause of the current reduction in productivity, according to the Productivity Commission, is the extraordinary performance of the Australian labour market. That is because those opposite failed to understand how productivity is measured and calculated. It is calculated as the ratio of output to hours worked and other inputs in the economy changing over time. What the Productivity Commission are telling us is that we have an incredibly strong labour market that has produced an unprecedented boom in hours worked, and the consequence of that boom in hours worked is that productivity has fallen. On the first point, the opposition simply fail to understand the cause of the current productivity slump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, they fail to understand the long-term drivers of productivity. For them to come into this chamber and suggest that Australia has a contemporary productivity problem ignores their own record on productivity, which, frankly, is nothing less than disastrous. In 2024, the Productivity Commission identified that the productivity growth rate for the most recent five years, a period covered by the opposition's time in government, 2018-19 to 2022-23, was 0.2 per cent; it was 0.2 per cent during the time the opposition were in office. That is around one-sixth of the long-term growth rate of productivity over the preceding 20 years of 1.3 per cent. They don't understand the current productivity slump, they don't understand its history and they have no solutions for its future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  Over the last fortnight I've been talking to families and businesses across the Berowra electorate. They're hurting because costs are going up and Labor 's economic policies are making things worse. They are people like Adam, who's a small-business owner from Thornleigh. Through his business, Adam supports 11 families. He wrote to me and said, 'I'm working six to seven days a week, 12 to 16 hours a day, missing out on family time, trying to cover my costs. My kids are missing out because I need to keep on top of the business and paperwork and to support my employees.' I spoke to Ajit, a small-business owner from Pennant Hills, and heard about his struggles with the massive increases in energy and gas prices, rising rent, and higher interest rates impacting the purchasing power of his customers. Ajit told me that his energy prices have doubled since Labor came to office. In my recent Berowra small-business survey, 70 per cent of businesses said that the cost of living has impacted customer demand. How can small businesses be expected to survive the economic climate that Labor has created? The sad answer is that they can't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's economic policies are based on a range of bad ideas that have been tried and have failed; yet, despite that experience, this government is trying them again. We see Labor's approach in the way they are dealing with the cost-of-living crisis. Orthodox economic policy is that, when inflation is going up and up, you reduce government spending to take pressure off prices, but Labor have increased government expenditure to the tune of $315 billion since they came to office. We have a productivity crisis. Orthodox economic policy says that you create greater flexibility in the labour market to improve productivity and to create more jobs, but Labor's re-regulation of the labour market in response to the demands of their union mates is making the lives of Australians harder. Orthodox economic policy says that you let markets decide what industries to invest in, and when governments pick winners you end up with bad results. But Labor's manufacturing policy is taking the same failed approach. The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. To quote that great political philosopher, Forrest Gump, 'Stupid is as stupid does.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community and around the country are hurting because of Labor's policies that are damaging our economy, eviscerating the private sector's productivity and making the cost of living worse and worse. The Albanese government have failed to manage the economy, and last week's national accounts demonstrate how bad their management is. Outside the pandemic, we are now at the slowest GDP growth since the nineties, with the sixth consecutive quarter of negative GDP per person growth and the longest per capita recession in 50 years. No Australian can possibly say that they are better off today than they were when this government came to power in May 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the weight of this bad Labor government, productivity has collapsed by 6.3 per cent, living standards have fallen by 8.7 per cent, household savings are down 10.2 per cent, personal income taxes are higher to the tune of 25.3 per cent, and interest paid on mortgages has almost tripled. Labor inherited a strong economy with low unemployment, strong growth and recovering government finances, and they've wasted it. Our core inflation is now higher than all the comparable economies, including all the English-speaking democracies and most of Europe. Australians are paying more and getting less. Gas is up 33 per cent, electricity is up 14 per cent, rents are up 16 per cent, and the cost of food is up 12 per cent. This winter, too many Australians in my community had to choose whether to put the heating on or to put food on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story for small businesses is terrible as well, as the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman told us last week. Forty-six per cent of small businesses didn't make a profit in the past year. Three out of four self-employed business owners are earning less than the average total weekly full-time wage. Twenty per cent of small businesses are struggling to pay their energy bills on time and 45 per cent are concerned about their ability to pay future energy bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians saw the highest number of insolvencies in the last financial year, with more than 11,000 businesses going insolvent. Behind each of those insolvencies is the human tragedy: the story of a family which has put its house on the line. Rather than fighting inflation at this time, this Treasurer has decided to pick a fight with the Reserve Bank governor, because Michele Bullock had the temerity to tell the Treasurer a few home truths when she said, 'the only way interest rates can be reduced is an improvement in our appalling'—yes, that's the word she used—'productivity'. This should be the government's sole focus, but it isn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have never needed a change of government more than they do right now, and in this election Australians will face a real alternative. Winning the fight against inflation and improving productivity is the only way to ease the cost-of-living pressures that are facing Australians. The Labor government is hurting Australians and the Australian people have had enough. It's time for a new government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  I'll begin this contribution by making a confession of sorts, and that is that I have a background as a macroeconomist. I say that because macroeconomists don't agree on a lot. That's why Harry Truman once famously asked for a one-armed economist—so that the person couldn't constantly say 'on the other hand' when giving opinions. But there is one thing that macroeconomists agree on, and that is that productivity growth underpins our long-term growth in living standards. Productivity growth is central. Paul Krugman put it clearly and just about best when he said that, when you look at long-term growth in per capita living standards, productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it's almost everything. That's what we've seen across a range of countries. Whether it be advanced economies sustaining productivity growth over the last 150 years or whether it be the East Asian miracles, productivity growth is at the heart of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When those opposite say we inherited a strong economy, I don't know if they're referring to the fact that we inherited an economy which, over a decade, had the worst productivity growth in over half a century. For over 60 years, there wasn't any administration that matched the previous one for low productivity growth, but those opposite are still saying that we inherited strength. That's not the case. We are putting in place a range of measures and policies that are turning around the inheritance that we got from those opposite, but it doesn't happen overnight. There is a certain momentum to productivity growth, and it is taking time to turn around a decade of economic vandalism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are some of the core planks of what we're doing to turn around the low productivity growth that we've seen in our economy? One is human capital development, which is central to economic growth over the long term. We are investing massively in skills, in TAFE, in apprenticeships—all areas which those opposite ripped funding out of. We came to government with no national agreement on skills for a decade, with the TAFE sector bleeding cash and with apprenticeships underdone in so many areas. That's why we found labour shortages and inappropriately low skills levels. We came to power also after a decade of zero attention to the clean energy transition. Any macroeconomist or policy expert will tell you that the transition to a clean-energy, net-zero economy is absolutely critical to our long-term productivity growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to one other area which is such a common reference point between the two major parties when it comes to productivity growth. Those opposite fall back on the old shibboleth of the need for more flexibility in workplace relations, but the evidence points against the kinds of strategies and policies that those opposite advocate. That's why, when you look at the evidence, you see that they were in charge of an economy where productivity growth was low and going backwards. The OECD, in recent papers in 2019 and 2018, argued that greater coordination in wage bargaining and greater employee voice, such as through unions having a seat at the table, are key ingredients for good labour market performance, including higher employment, inclusive labour markets and lower inequality. Moreover, more collaborative workplaces can also contribute to lower turnover and longer tenure, which can reduce hiring and training costs and increase productivity. That is from the OECD, and that goes to the point that the member for Parramatta raised earlier, which is that more hours worked is hardly a problem in the economy. What we're in fact seeing is that firms are more willing to hire, retain and invest in people, which is leading to greater productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Alex Bryson from University College London found that employee voice helps improve worker engagement, helping companies to innovate and adopt more productive practices. Those opposite fall back on flexibility time and time again, using this ill-defined term which seems to mean either people working longer for the same pay or less or more employer rights at the expense of more union rights or more worker voice. But the evidence points to more productivity when you have people sitting around the table and working together. Those opposite gave us the lowest productivity growth in half a decade. We're investing in our economy and our people to turn that around.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  The member for Fraser has fallen into the same trap that the Treasurer seems to be in and seems to not be able to get out of—this deep dark hole where they think that, when Labor resumed power in May 2022, the entire economy was bereft of vision, productivity and economic growth indicators. The fact is—and this is an absolute truth—Labor inherited a very good set of numbers, notwithstanding the pandemic that swept the globe, for which Australia was rated second in the world, according to the John Hopkins institute. We saved millions of jobs and tens of thousands of lives during the pandemic. That's what we did. The economic record that we produced was one which we should be proud of. The Labor surpluses were made possible by us and the very good prices for coal, iron ore and agriculture—three key export industries. These are three industries, I might add, that Labor are now trying to shut down.</span>

We are going to be shutting down factories and manufacturing. Labor goes on and on about it being made in Australia. Let me tell you, when the lights can't be turned on and the power can't be sourced because of Labor's rush to renewables, we're not going to have a coal sector, and we're not going to be having those coal-fired power stations—</span>

When you look at productivity, you look at factors such as living standards. Real disposable income net per capita has fallen by 8.7 per cent under Labor. Productivity has collapsed 6.3 per cent. Household savings are down 10.2 percentage points. Personal income taxes are 25.3 per cent higher. Interest paid on mortgages has almost tripled.

It was like that naughty schoolboy who comes to school not having done his homework and blaming the poor family pet, the dog, for eating said homework. It is his fault. It is the Treasurer's fault that we have a national productivity decline. It is his fault that we have inflation rampantly out of control. It is his fault that we don't just have a crisis in cost of living but a crisis of confidence—confidence by our small-business operators.</span>

Tomorrow morning we get the opportunity to hear from some of those farmers, those Keep the Sheep farmers—those brave souls from Western Australia who are getting their industry shut down. Shame on the Treasurer because in the last budget he delivered, right at that spot there, that the largest amount of money being spent on agriculture in that economic statement was to shut down an industry—$107 million to shut down live sheep. Australia led the world in that export trade and led the world in animal welfare standards. Tomorrow is a big test. See how many Labor members go out and address those farmers out on the front lawn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I would like to comment on a couple of the member for Riverina's comments. He said that Labor doesn't like mining and Labor doesn't like resources. 'Labor doesn't really like anything'—that's pretty much what he was getting at. We support miners in the Hunter and we support miners all around Australia. Whilst people want to buy our coal, we'll continue to supply them our coal; 93 per cent of the coal from the Hunter is exported out of this country, so it's not even used in our coal-fired power stations. As I said, whilst people want to buy our coal, we will always supply them our coal. Thank you to the hardworking miners all around Australia for what you do. You put your lives on the line every day to go to work and earn a good income to support your families. Thank you for all that you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it quite ironic that those opposite want to come in here and talk about productivity when the only thing they're productive at is pointing fingers. They had a decade in government and absolutely wasted it, with misguided priorities and missed opportunities. This failure did not contribute to a more productive country; that's for sure. It was those opposite who caused productivity to plummet. It was those opposite who oversaw the worst decade of productivity growth in more than half a century, and now it is those opposite who want to come in here and lecture us about productivity. Maybe they should stick to subjects that they know best, like colour coded spreadsheets, because boosting productivity is certainly not something that they are qualified to speak on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way that they view productivity and the way that we view productivity are two very different things. We believe that workers drive our country forward and that, if they are protected and paid properly, they are going to do the best they can in their workplaces. We value our workers and we know that it's because of them that our country is able to keep moving forward. But those opposite unfortunately see workers as pawns on a chessboard. They think workers are there to serve the business they work for and it's for the business to use them and treat them any way that they please. They want Australians to work longer for less because they don't care whether somebody works hard all week and is hardly able to provide for their family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we look at things differently. That's why our budget was focused on making life better for everyday working people; it's by lifting these people up that we also lift productivity. We invested in people, new industries and better-functioning markets and in boosting competition, and the best example of boosting productivity is giving people opportunities that they have never had before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, hundreds, if not thousands, of people have been able to get a trade, something that will set them up and open countless doors for good employment for years to come. Many more people having a trade means one thing: more productivity in our economy. All of this is possible because of our fee-free TAFE policies and the fact that we are opening more fee-free TAFE places for construction workers, plumbers, chippies, boilermakers, fitters and mechanics—for so many different areas of trades that we need in the Hunter. Those opposite firmly believe that they could boost productivity by blocking wage rises, leaving workers struggling with the cost of living. They think that creating insecure jobs and unsafe working conditions will help productivity growth. We want secure jobs. We want people to have good, healthy and safe conditions at work. We want people to be paid properly for the job they do. Everyone should be able to go home at the end of a long, hard day and feel like it's worth it because they're able to properly provide for themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 10 years, workers were neglected, and the results are clear. The coalition's report card on productivity has a big, fat F stamped on the front of it. They failed workers, they failed to increase productivity and they left us in a hole that we are working hard to get out of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will take time to repair the damage to Australia's productivity growth that was done by the opposition's decade of neglect, but we know that a new approach is needed, an approach that puts workers at the centre of everything we do, and that's what we're delivering on. We've had a focus on helping business to be more productive, but we aren't doing it by neglecting workers, because, if we've learnt one thing from those opposite, it's that that approach definitely does not work. Instead, we have a solid pipeline for business investment, which is now above where it was during the mining boom, and our policies are helping to not only attract investment but to better absorb it and enable it. We want our country to be more productive and we are doing the best we can to make sure that happens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports these amendments made by the Senate. The Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 is an essential piece of legislation. I am grateful to the Senate for its engagement and to senators for passing the bill last month. The Net Zero Economy Authority will support Australian communities to seize the opportunities of the transition to a net zero economy. It will help ensure we successfully navigate this transformation. It will leave no worker, community or region behind as we build the industries and the jobs of our net zero future. The amendments passed by the Senate are constructive proposals. That is why the government is supportive of these additional amendments. They clarify certain elements of the bill, confirm its intent and address matters raised by stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the amendments do not substantially change the intended operation of the Net Zero Economy Authority or the Energy Industry Jobs Plan that it will administer. I will speak to each of the amendments briefly. Amendment to clause 3—the object: this amendment adds reference to communities in the object clause of the bill. The bill, as introduced by the government, already made it clear that, in performing its functions, the Net Zero Economy Authority will prioritise communities, regions, industries and workers that are or will be significantly affected by Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy. The authority's operating model will be to work in partnership with and through local institutions and stakeholders. It will bring significant resources and capacity of the Commonwealth into local settings and be driven by local and regional priorities. The government is happy to support this amendment. It highlights that supporting communities will be a central focus of the authority's work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment to clause 68—tabling of review of part 5: the amendment will ensure that the review of part 5 of the bill, which relates to the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, will be tabled in both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days once provided to the minister. This amendment is minor and responds to a recommendation from the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The government accepts this amendment as a means of supporting transparency and accountability in government operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment to clause 74—annual report: this amendment will require the authority to include in its annual report a section reporting on the operation of the act. This includes describing how the operation of the act responds to the needs and circumstances of communities, regions, industries and workers that are or will be significantly affected by Australia's transition to a net zero emissions economy. The government wants to ensure that the authority operates in accordance with the act to enhance transparency and accountability, and the government supports this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New clause 80(A)—reviews of the operation of the act: this amendment will require the minister to cause an independent review of the operation of the act if a recommendation is made by the board of the authority. The government notes that the Commonwealth government structures policy provides for periodic reviews of new and existing governance bodies at least every 10 years. The government supports statutory bodies being reviewed to ensure they remain fit for purpose. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are happy to go one step further and agree to include a general review provision in this bill. Every report of a review sets out one or more recommendations to the government. A government response to each of the recommendations must be prepared and tabled in both houses of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments to clause 23, on board composition, would require that one board member have expertise or experience in Indigenous advocacy or community leadership. That would increase the minimum number of board members from six to seven. Indigenous advocacy or community leadership was already a field from which potential board members could be drawn. The government is happy to go one step further and require that one board member has this expertise or experience. The amendments to the board's composition confirm that First Nations people are vital partners in the net zero transformation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important. Whilst I support this bill, it can go further and be much clearer. A future made in Australia is vital for our future. I do support the intent of this legislation, but we must be very clear about the detail. The world is decarbonising, with demand growing for commodities and products that will enable global decarbonisation. Australia, with its abundant natural resources and capacity for innovation, can capitalise on this demand and strengthen our economy through green exports. While the opportunities are great, the opportunity cost is even greater. By failing to seize this opportunity to develop green exports, the world will decarbonise and demand for our traditional commodities of coal and gas will decline, undermining our economy. I acknowledge that. So we need to be very clear, when we say 'a future made in Australia', just how we are going to deliver the intention and the goal that is stated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The policy is welcome, but it must be central to and the cornerstone of our economic policy for decades to come. It must be clear what it is aligned to, and that is a net zero world—clean energy, clean resources and clean technology. That is vital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must play to our natural advantage, support both existing and new players and ensure funding is targeted and fiscally responsible to ensure a return on investment.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments that I moved today focus on ensuring that decarbonisation remains the focus of this Future Made in Australia policy. The government has considered my amendments, and I thank the Treasurer and his team for the discussions that we've had in that respect. I believe part of one of my amendments will be offered up as part of a government amendment, which will address some concerns but not all of the concerns that I've expressed. I understand the government will adopt, in part, one of my amendments, which is in respect to First Nations communities and traditional owners being able to participate in and share the benefits of the net zero transition. This is important, and I welcome this move.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I understand they're not going to accept the amendments around making sure emissions reduction is at the core of a future made in Australia. They believe it's already implicit in this bill, but, as we see too often in this place, there is no such thing as being implicit in legislation. It must be explicit. Specifically, the amendments I've moved to the preamble and objects of this act make reference to the Paris Agreement in keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees of warming. We must ensure an investment of the scale of Future Made in Australia is in line with that commitment; it must be linked to that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current bill considers decarbonisation and the net zero economy considerations in only one stream, with the second stream referring to economic resilience and security. But you cannot have economic resilience and security unless you are operating in a net zero economy. Therefore, my amendments expressly state that support under this stream is for economic resilience, climate resilience and security within a net zero economy. These amendments will not only safeguard against the Future Made in Australia supporting fossil fuel projects, which absolutely should not happen, but also ensure that any support under the legislation, whether it be for medical manufacturing or defence manufacturing, is given to a project and business aligned with net zero goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments also mean that sector assessments must take into account direct emissions and decarbonisation potential, recognising that some projects, such as critical minerals value-adding, may add to Australia's emissions but, ultimately, lead to a substantial net decrease in emissions over their life cycle through the decarbonisation that they will enable—for example, electric vehicles and batteries. We must integrate decarbonisation in every aspect of legislation, especially when we are talking about the substantial spending of public money.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this legislation, the Treasurer commits to improving government decision-making on significant public investments to help industry develop the technologies necessary to decarbonise our economy. It's true that we all want to be sure that the government will not sponsor businesses which will never be internationally competitive or will create long-term dependency on public support at a significant cost to the wider economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the next two decades, the world will stop buying fossil fuels and other countries will enforce carbon border adjustment mechanisms. If we're still then dependent on being a petrostate, we will tank economically. We have clear competitive advantages in our sun, our wind and our critical minerals. We have the ability to become a green energy superpower, exporting decarbonised and value added strategic metals and critical minerals which will simultaneously earn income for Australia and contribute to global decarbonisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we jump to subsidising new technologies in nascent industries, we have to identify those in which we have a demonstrable current or future competitive advantage and determine how best to support them, while minimising risks to the taxpayer. All industry assistance comes at a cost to those who are not supported. There's always an opportunity cost in subsidising manufacturing and industry. In recent decades, much of our manufacturing has gone offshore. Supply chains are affecting us every day. We have not been effective enough in diversifying supply, stockpiling, forging alternate arrangements and switching technologies to minimise supply chain disruptions. We need to determine where supply chain issues really do, genuinely, require local manufacturing and where other means might be more economical. We should also remember those areas in which we have a genuine sovereign risk and the potential to develop both a domestic surety and a significant export market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some ways, this act acts as an umbrella to better coordinate the suite of existing initiatives and funds aimed at the decarbonisation of our economy, but the means by which it will intersect and interact with other entities in this space, whether that be the Productivity Commission, CSIRO, ARENA, the CEFC or others, is not yet clear. To ensure value for money, any government assistance should be based on an independent, transparent and evidence based assessment of the risks and the potential benefits associated with each proposal. There should be tight criteria specifying the outcomes to be achieved and mandated performance monitoring against those specified outcomes. The secretary should be compelled to consult with the relevant authorities and entities undertaking those assessments. Only those entities meeting strict criteria for funding in the national interest should receive public support. We want to streamline assessments, minimise duplication and increase accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early indicators unfortunately have cast some doubt on the government's preparedness to adhere to these standards under this legislation. The government has already started to allocate funds under the scheme, and, in some cases, there are real questions around the integrity of the decision-making with those grant decisions. So the amendments I've moved today to this bill will increase clarity regarding sectoral assessments and the extent to which they will consider such questions as relevant to international trade agreements, current national stockpiles and resources and the need for diversification of our resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to national resilience than spending. We can achieve and address supply chain security in ways other than insourcing. I move here an amendment to ensure that funding under the FMIA framework does not proceed unless all other alternatives have been exhausted. We deserve more transparency over fund allocation. This should include processes which don't include NDAs, closed ministerial diaries and redaction of FOIs, processes which involve open calls for tenders, not lobbying firms and negotiations facilitated by former Labor Party staffers, which don't waste the time, money and effort of other companies and which don't cause a loss of trust in government. The amendments I move here address those concerns, and I commend them to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm supportive of the intention of the Future Made in Australia Bill, but, as I said in my second reading speech, in order for this to be successful we need to know that the right people are making the right decisions for the right reasons. The government has set out a framework for future investments, intended to provide reassurance that taxpayer money will be spent sensibly so we can prosper in a global net zero economy, but I have some concerns about whether this framework is strong enough to provide that reassurance, so I'll be supporting all amendments that increase the transparency and integrity of this framework, including the two amendments that I'm proposing here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that the government needs to be nimble and respond to opportunities, but when making investment decisions under the Future Made in Australia, it will be investing our hard-earned dollars, so it needs to have a clear and direct mandate. If the government tells Australians that an investment is being made as part of the Future Made in Australia package, that should be shorthand for, 'We have undertaken a rigorous assessment and acted on the best advice available.' If any old investment can be shoehorned into this Future Made in Australia thing, it becomes a slush fund. It's always tempting for the government to have it both ways—to try to provide assurance about a rigorous process but maintain the discretion to ignore the process that it's putting in place. The amendments I'm proposing are designed to limit the government's ability to avoid using the processes that it's going to great pains to design.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the amendments I'm proposing makes it clear that, if support is labelled as being part of the government's Future Made in Australia package, it must be linked to a sector that has actually been assessed as part of the National Interest Framework. In other words, the government can't say, 'We've got this great rigorous sector assessment process, but we don't have to use it.' Currently the bill requires the government to identify sectors that align with the National Interest Framework and would benefit from government investment to address barriers to private investment, but there's no requirement for the government to only provide support in sectors that have been identified in this way. So the government can stick a Future Made in Australia label on anything it wants, even if it's not in a sector that's been assessed as being worthy of government investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing government to use taxpayer funds for industry policy requires a leap of faith that the government will make good investment decisions. Unfortunately, governments don't have a great track record of making good investment decisions in situations of uncertainty. I recognise that, with the way other countries are responding to rapid economic transition towards decarbonisation, we do have to take some risks, but this amendment is designed to reduce that risk and prevent stupid things from getting through. If the government backs the process it has designed for sector assessments, it should be willing to commit to using it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My other amendment recognises that this is a rapidly changing space. In setting industry policy, we need to be acting on the best and most current information we have about where the global opportunities lie. For example, certain critical minerals have a bright future now, based on promising developments in different battery technologies, but in a few years some may hit brick walls and others flourish. I recognise that good decisions made now on the best available information may not look like good decisions as technology changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the bill is currently drafted, sector assessments are conducted on the direction of the minister within a period defined by the minister, and a report is delivered as required by the minister. The sector assessment then remains in operation without recourse to review. My amendment requires that sector assessments be reviewed every five years to ensure that they continue to be the appropriate areas of investment for Australian taxpayer dollars. While regular assessment may be part of the intention of the government, it's not explicitly required in the bill, which may result in one sector being available for investment long after that's appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Treasurer's office for his engagement on these amendments and acknowledge the work that he's done on their own amendments to improve the transparency of this bill. If the government is not going to accept these amendments, I'd appreciate any reassurance that the Treasurer is willing to give about the circumstances in which Future Made in Australia support could be granted to a sector that has not been assessed as needing public investment. If there are no examples of that then I urge the government to adopt these amendments to help taxpayers believe that their money will be well spent to build a resilient future economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Made in Australia Bill is a welcome step in the right direction from the government, one which establishes strong foundations for world-leading Australian renewable energy, manufacturing and export industries. However, at present, there is a glaring loophole in the bill that needs closing—that is, that despite being touted as a game-changing investment in clean energy industries, jobs and exports, under this legislation there is no requirement for these investments to be clean and green. The Australian Conservation Foundation notes this in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill. I thank them for working with me to redraft this amendment which closes the loophole by ensuring that neither stream of the national interest framework can be used to invest in or support fossil fuel, nuclear power or carbon capture and storage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents in Tasmania and, indeed, millions of Australians right across the country, know we're running out of time to reduce emissions and mitigate the worst of the impacts of climate change. As I said before many times, the fossil fuel industry is rapidly strangling our planet and it is past time this government acted with urgency on the climate emergency. It is simply unconscionable that Australia is currently one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels in the world. In fact, we are currently third behind Russia and the United States. It seems all this government has done so far is double-down, but most Australians know it makes neither environmental nor economic sense to continue to approve and invest in fossil fuel exploration, exploitation and infrastructure. Even the International Energy Agency tells us that oil, gas and coal demand is expected to peak this decade, which means fossil fuel projects are rapidly becoming stranded assets. At the same time, at COP-28 just last year, world leaders agreed to accelerate efforts towards net zero in a just, orderly and equitable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become all too clear that neither the climate crisis nor the economic reality leave room for continued misguided investments in fossil fuels. That's why my amendment ensures that they aren't eligible for support and investment under the Future Made in Australia framework. The same goes for carbon capture and storage. To be clear, I don't object to the technology in principle, but do I hold concerns that, in its current state, it's unproven, and, in too many cases, it is used as an expensive smokescreen to hide the continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last issue my amendment deals with is nuclear power. It's increasingly clear that when talking about a clean net zero future made in Australia, nuclear can't be a part of the solution. We have seen report after report saying nuclear is too slow and too costly to play any significant role in Australia's transition to net zero, not to mention the risks associated with waste management. No. Instead, we need to be prioritising our efforts and seizing on our natural advantages to ensure we don't throw good money after bad. I'm optimistic about these advantages and I'm optimistic about our ability to pull off a just transition and meet our net zero commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know there is so much opportunity for us in the energy transition because we're blessed with abundant clean energy resources and we have a highly skilled and educated workforce. In other words, we have what it takes to be a clean energy super power and to lead the world in this economic and environmental transition. The potential benefits for job creation and skills development, local communities and the environment are obvious to anyone paying attention. We in this place need to make sure it's set up and powered by renewable energy industries and not off the back of continued investment in climate-wrecking fossil fuels or greenwashed nonsolutions such as nuclear and carbon capture and storage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would love to believe we can trust this and future governments not to use this legislation to prop up climate-damaging industries, but I've been around long enough to know that trust in government is built on solid mechanisms of transparency and accountability. That's exactly what my amendment provides for, and I urge all members to support it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's amendments represent some improvements to the integrity and robustness of this legislation and ensure it is futureproofed from politicisation. First Nations communities must be included in the benefits of our transition to net zero, and a new community development principle is a small step forward to this end. No community development principle explicitly provides for the role of women, though, in Australia's future net zero economy workforce, as my amendment does, which I'll address in a moment. It is critical for government to consult widely if sector assessments are to be a genuine partnership between government and industry. Mandatory consultation is positive. The government's second amendment, a requirement for just one consultation, goes some way to this but leaves more to be desired, and the government's third amendment, additional annual reporting requirements, is another step but, again, a small one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians must have confidence in their public spending. This means robust financial reporting which details how supports are intended to be implemented as well as the duration of those supports. My amendments, therefore, would address each of the issues addressed by the government amendments but go further towards a legislative package with integrity and robustness.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first amendment proposes a new standalone community development principle to guide the implementation of FMIA supports towards the inclusion of women in our future net zero workforce, which is critical to our net zero transition. I'm concerned that the absence of such a principle to drive the participation of women in our net zero economy will leave 50 per cent of our population uninvolved and unempowered and create yet another high-vis male workforce.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second amendment would empower the Department of the Treasury itself to initiate sector assessments. One need only look to the Productivity Commission—indeed, in the Treasurer's own portfolio—to a model which possesses an element of independence and protection against ministerial interference. The Productivity Commission, while taking direction for assessments from its minister, can determine areas of the economy to conduct research in, as it deems appropriate. I can't see anything in this bill to prevent a future minister from simply not directing the Department of the Treasury to conduct sector assessments at all should it not be in the political interests of the government of the day.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My third amendment would add an additional eligibility criteria to the net zero transformation stream to ensure that FMIA supports are committed only to projects which would substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and net zero. Projects that receive Commonwealth support must be able to substantiate precisely how they would implement this funding towards what should be the primary goal of this legislation—that is, net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fourth amendment addresses the vast gaps of accountability and financial reporting the Treasury and funding recipients would be expected to produce once the funding has been delivered. Treasury would be expected to detail the intended objectives that each of its recommendations in sector assessments would intend to achieve, including how success would be measured, review potential barriers to these objectives and, importantly, specify a duration for these supports. It is vital that the renewable industries which the legislation seeks to build are sustainable and able to be competitive in the market once their Future Made in Australia support has ceased. I commend these amendments to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are clear reasons to be optimistic about Australia's economic opportunities for the global transition to net zero. Market failures in green industries, including a lack of a universal carbon price, the need to move faster in the transition and spillover benefits of new technology, mean that there are clear reasons why government has a role to play. But it's fair to say that Australia has a mixed record when it comes to industrial policy, and stakeholders from across the political spectrum have raised a number of concerns about the government's proposal to date—about the risk of picking winners, about the degree of ministerial discretion and about how ill-defined phrases like 'economic security' could be used to justify every future minister's pet projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are valid concerns. They don't mean that we should not act; they just mean that how we act is really important. We can't afford to make the mistakes of the past, where money was wasted on failing industries that never had a chance of standing on their own two feet. Instead we need to provide support where there are market failures and where Australia can have a sustainable competitive advantage, and we need a robust and transparent framework to guide these investments, with decisions made wherever possible at arm's length from government. This bill provides for some of that, and I welcome the government's amendments, which will go some way to addressing these concerns. However, there remains a concerning loophole in this legislation which I believe needs to be closed, and my amendment seeks to do this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill creates a national interest framework and the sector assessment process which are intended to provide discipline and rigour around government spending under the Future Made in Australia. Sectors should not receive support until this process identifies a clear need for it. That is a good thing. But, whilst the government has lauded this new sector assessment process, you don't need to conduct a sector assessment before a sector can receive support under the Future Made in Australia. In the current legislation, the sector assessment process is essentially optional. This creates the potential for the framework to be bypassed by a future government and for taxpayer money to be invested in industries and pet projects without clear justification. This point has been highlighted by stakeholders as diverse as the BCA and the ACF—and by many parliamentarians during the second reading debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendment will help close this loophole. It will require that the sector assessment is conducted and that the results are considered by the minister before support for the sector can be made available under the Future Made in Australia. This is a commonsense amendment which strengthens the guardrails around government spending under this bill and is aligned with how the Treasurer has said the process is meant to work. It does not unnecessarily constrain government investing. It does not prevent the government from acting quickly. It does not create an unrealistic expectation that every sector which is assessed will get government support. It simply seeks to legislate the guardrails the government has already told us they want to follow. I therefore urge the government and the opposition to support it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Last month the Capricorn Coast lost a true legend, Brian Dorey OAM, a man dedicated to the service of his community. He leaves a lasting legacy that will be felt for decades to come. Brian served the shire of Livingstone for over three decades as a councillor, fighting hard and working tirelessly to improve the lives and outcomes of his constituents. He had a deeply admirable work ethic which, combined with his unwavering commitment to the people of Yeppoon, ensured he was deeply respected by many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to his long service as a Livingston shire councillor, Brain was a hardworking member of the Yeppoon Lions Club. He lived and breathed a life of voluntary service, a quality that many hold in high regard. As a journalist in the Rockhampton office of<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Morning Bulletin</span> Mr Dorey was able to document, day by day, the region he loved dearly. He's been described as having had a brilliant sense of humour, someone who always loved a chin wag and someone with the tenacity to get the job done. After a long career as a councillor, community man and respected journalist, he will be highly missed by the many people whose lives he touched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will remember Brian as incredibly selfless, a man truly dedicated to the people he served. My thoughts are with his loving wife, Olive, and the rest of the Dorey family in what is a very difficult time. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  26 September 2024 marks 30 years since the ALP adopted affirmative action quotas for women to be preselected as candidates in held and winnable seats. Today, half of the ALP members in parliaments across the nation are female, and I have the honour of sitting in the first federal government whose caucus is majority female.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember when I entered Young Labor, around 1994, when these measures were introduced, and I spoke to women about the challenges that they faced. Politics is partly a meritocracy, but, in practice, barriers emerge for different groups of people, including but not limited to women. There is inertia where certain types of people get promoted or preselected because they are like people currently in positions of power. Challenging preconceptions can be exacerbated in politics, in particular, which is so based on long-lasting networks and cliques. It's a numbers game, and this can make it hard to break in to. Quotas were a way of helping to overcome these barriers, and they've worked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At an individual level, it's given so many women a chance to serve in federal and state and territory governments, with so many firsts, including Julia Gillard but many others. Equally, at a systemic level, it's also improved the quality of decision-making and policy development by ensuring that the people introducing and debating the ideas and voting on the budgets and laws are more representative of our community. I'm pleased to speak today on this anniversary and to celebrate the contributions of my amazing female colleagues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  In his budget-in-reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, recommitted to assisting first home buyers access their superannuation through the super homebuyer scheme. The super homebuyer scheme will allow first home buyers to invest up to 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to a maximum of $50,000, to help purchase their first home. This would allow your super to work for you and assist with the purchase of your first home; it would then be returned to your super at a later date, achieving the best of both worlds: home ownership and retirement security. This scheme would help young Australians get into their first home sooner and live the Australian dream of owning their own home. I think this is a great opportunity for people—particularly for those between 23 and 39 who haven't purchased their own home yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens will never support this scheme. They didn't support the First Home Super Saver Scheme either. It will be only a coalition LNP government that will bring this scheme in. The coalition is committed to putting Australians in charge of their future with their own money. It's your money. It's not the government's money. Only a federal coalition government will give this extra lever to Australians, if we are successful at the next election. Whenever in May the federal election may be, I urge all young Australians to support the coalition in order to make this scheme a reality.</span>

This moment is possible because, 30 years ago, the Australian Labor Party made the courageous decision to implement affirmative action quotas for winnable seats. As a result, we now have the first government in Australian history where women are the majority. I am proud to be a woman of colour, I am proud to be Australian and I am proud to be a member of the Australian Labor Party—a party that not only paves the way for women in parliament but also stands up for women in every household in this nation.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  One of the most rewarding working groups established in the time that I've been the Independent member for North Sydney has been the Ageing Well group. This talented collection of individuals includes subject matter specialists, more mature constituents, carers and adult children. As a volunteer group, they are passionately committed to articulating and elevating the needs and interests of our whole community as we all, hopefully, age gracefully and healthily. At a time when our approach to aged care is undergoing a fundamental shift, it is essential that lived experience is placed at the centre of important policy decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the group hosted a perspective-altering event on death, dying and grief, where the taboos of death and dying were addressed head on. The group was determined this conversation should happen, as one of the key elements of living well is to try and prepare for a good death and a gentle transition to those we leave behind. Our audience came away from the event armed with valuable insights on preparing wills, tips for organising personal affairs, ways of holding uncomfortable conversations and surviving grief so we all grow stronger from loss. I'm deeply grateful to those who participated in the event for their candid and generous sharing of their stories and expertise. To Michelle Chaperon, Jill Nash, Margaret Blake, Bruce Fraser, Christina Sumner, Nikki Wilson and Glenda Hewitt, thank you. As the member for North Sydney, it's a great honour and privilege to help create the space for events like this.</span>

Over 50 per cent of all Labor members of parliament across this nation are women. This stands in contrast to the parties that form the coalition, those opposite, in this parliament. The Liberal Party has recorded its lowest female representation in parliament since 1993, and that is less than one-third.</span>

Selena Uibo has just become the first Aboriginal woman to lead a major political party in Australia, building on the great work of my parliamentary colleagues from the Territory, the member for Lingiari and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span>

                  </a>  Maybe you could listen to this and realise the consequences of your actions. A single mum in Brisbane evicted into homelessness has a daughter studying in TAFE and a son in year 12. She's had a perfect 10-year rental history—never late and always had her bond returned—but can't find anywhere to live. Rather than sleeping in her car, she is burning through her life savings to pay for hotel fees. Here's what she said to me: 'The system is working as intended—a punitive system designed to entrench a permanent underclass. Housing is designed by politicians as an investment, so the goal is money over people. This is not living but existing.' She went on to say: 'We didn't choose this path. We are victims of a government that failed to plan, failed the country and failed the people they allegedly serve. The cost of this mental trauma will be staggering. I see others in this hotel and at the storage facility in the same predicament. Families are being divided as they can't stay together. Children are placed with relatives or friends, sleeping in a car.'</span>

This single mum, like the five million adult renters in this country, will not forget Labor's betrayal. They will not forget that Labor chose to give billions of dollars in tax relief to property investors rather than help people like her. They will not forget that Labor had the power to cap rent increases and refused.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise to acknowledge it's been 30 years since the Labor Party adopted affirmative action and set quotas for women in parliament. It worked. At the time, when we had the debates in Labor, it was about changing party culture. We are the oldest political party in this country. We recognised that if we wanted more women to represent the Australian Labor Party then we had to change our culture, and we did that by setting targets. It's changed a few times over the years. At first, it was a target of 35 per cent, then 40, then to what we see today, which is the situation where we are in a government of majority women. That's because our party took the bold step to adopt the change at a party level, to encourage more women to be preselected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, Deputy Speaker Claydon, you and I, and the member sitting at the front desk there, acknowledged it has been 11 years since we were first elected to parliament. I was the first woman ever to be elected to represent the seat of Bendigo. It is a federation seat, and it took 113 years for a major political party to preselect a woman. I was the beneficiary of that and, as a result, we have a first in my seat. Like so many other seats on this side of the House, we have firsts because the Labor Party took the bold step to change its culture, to set quotas and give women an equal voice in this parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I want to acknowledge the passing of a remarkable Australian, Ray Davis—father, grandfather, husband, veteran and volunteer. I met Ray in his role as a member of the RSL sub-branch in Hornsby, where he ran the Anzac services and remembrance services for many years. He was a great organiser with a great commitment to community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray moved to Hornsby in the late 1970s and immediately immersed himself in community. He became active in scouting—organising camps, phone book drives and fundraisers. He coached his three children's sporting teams and was a very active parent at Our Lady of the Rosary in Waitara. He headed up a couple of successful fetes. More recently, he relished the role of grandfather and would volunteer at sporting carnivals and school events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like his father before him, Ray served our country in the Royal Australian Army Service Corps. Ray joined in 1965 and was a corporal in the Vietnam War, where he was deployed in 1970 and 1971. Ray's service shaped his later years. He had a deep commitment to his fellow veterans and their families. Ray became a qualified Department of Veterans' Affairs welfare officer and took a keen interest in the administration of veterans' entitlements. He gave selfless service to the Hornsby RSL Sub-Branch and the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Veterans Association, especially the Hornsby branch. He encouraged young people to take an interest in Australia's tradition of service. The causes Ray championed were great. To Ray's wife Christine, and to his family and mates: thank you for sharing Ray with our community and our country. May his memory be a blessing.</span>

Let me say: quotas work. As a result of Labor introducing quotas, our caucus is now majority female. I pay tribute to some of the trailblazing women who have helped us to get to this position. Labor is the home of the first deputy leader of a major political party in this country, Jenny Macklin, and, of course, our first female prime minister, Julia Gillard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Labor Party, we know that having women in the room and in parliament works. It gets us the results we need. As a result of having majority women in caucus, we are introducing policies like cheaper child care. We're putting superannuation on paid parental leave—six months paid parental leave—and this has expanded the scheme. We are increasing wages for aged-care workers and early childhood educators, and we are funding front-line services to end family and domestic violence. We are also doing much to reduce the gender pay gap. This week we will be introducing legislation to make sure that early childhood workers get a pay rise before Christmas. This all comes because we have women in the room. When women are in places of decision-making, we do better. I know this as patron of WILD—Women in Local Democracy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

People will feel like prisoners in their own home. They'll feel unsafe. Just last week, we heard of the Townsville Fire basketball team's coach having their house broken in to. Shannon Seebohm wasn't home, but his pregnant wife was. She woke up to a noise, encountered the intruders and screamed at them to leave. Instead of fleeing, these fees charged at her. She had to lock herself in the bedroom for safety. These thieves then ransacked the house, discovered the car keys and stole the family's vehicles, including the Townsville-Fire-branded car. Hours later, the car was discovered, burnt in flames, and the other vehicle was also found abandoned. Sadly, this has become all too regular in my community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few weeks, cars have been stolen from hospitals, the elderly have been robbed at knifepoint, and teenage gangs have terrorised our streets. Youth crime in Townsville is escalating, and the state Labor Party's light-on-criminals policy is making it worse. In Queensland far fewer teens have been locked up for their serious crimes. It's about time we get tough on youth crime. We must end the fail 'detention as a last resort' policy. It has failed. We need people representing Townsville that stand up and lock up these criminals.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  The Australian Labor Party took action 30 years ago to affirm the rights, the abilities and the potentials of all human beings in Australia. Back then, in 1994, decisions were often made without hearing or even considering women's opinions or perspectives. Labor decided that our parliament needed to reflect our nation—action was needed. That's what Labor does. We don't sit around telling Australians that things will work out in the end in some mysterious way; we work the problem. We set goals and targets and get on with it. The first goal then was to have female candidates in 35 per cent of all held and winnable seats by 2002. Labor achieved that in 2004. In 2002, we decided that by 2012, 40 per cent of held and winnable seats should have female candidates. In 2015, the ALP National Conference adopted a new target: half of all MPs and senators should be women by 2025—and that was achieved in 2022. Today, 50.2 per cent of all Labor members of parliament are women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is working for women in five particular priority areas: women's safety; sharing and valuing care; women's economic equality; health; and decision-making and leadership. In each of these areas, we will make things happen. We have the track record for this because we listen, we develop the policies in consultation, and then we fight for them. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, is going backwards. In this parliament it has its lowest percentage of women in 30 years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  In the last week of August I set out on my seventh Tour de Fisher, cycling across my electorate to host 23 listening posts in 23 towns over five days. The overwhelming feedback from locals was that they are struggling under Labor's cost-of-living crisis. Pensioners, self-funded retirees, single parents, families and aspirational Australians are barely making ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, it's disproportionately worse, and the QCOSS living affordability report released just today proves this point. Over one-third of Queenslanders' pay is going to housing. Petrol prices and poor public transport are driving up the cost of travel, particularly in regional places like mine on the Sunshine Coast. Families are forced to choose between school fees, health care and keeping the lights on. As the Leader of the Opposition talks about, people are having to choose between heating and eating. One contributor said to me, 'I keep recycling debt to get by, using my credit card to pay everyday bills.' Families are hurting, but where is Labor in all of this? They throw money and hold press conferences. Why do Australians always pay more under Labor?</span>

The Albanese Labor government is the first Australian majority women government ever—full stop, period. Was this an accident? Hell, no; this was deliberate by design. Thirty years ago the Australian Labor Party took a bold stance and backed affirmative action. The goal was to set a target for women to be preselected for held and winnable seats. We met our 2002 target of 35 per cent and our 2012 target of 40 per cent. And then we finally smashed the 50 per cent target in 2022.</span>

And what has the WA Liberal Party preselected in the west? In Hasluck, it's a bloke. In Pearce, it's a bloke. In Curtin, it's another bloke. In Swan, it's yet another bloke. But there are other seats with new candidates, like Bullwinkle, Tangney and even Moore. They're all blokes. Frankly, I'm astounded. Women want more, and I'm not just talking about the seat.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I want to congratulate Alex Saffy, who won a bronze medal in the men's 100-metre butterfly S10 final at the Paris Paralympic Games. Known as the Bunbury Bullet, Alex comes from our south-west in Western Australia. With his bronze medal win, Alex also set a new Oceanic record for the category. What a great job. He comes from the South West Academy of Sport, and at the age of 16 he made the move from Bunbury to Canberra, leaving behind his family and friends to take up a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport and to begin study at the University of Canberra as an elite athlete. In spite of all that change in his life, I know right now that Alex would believe, as his family would, that this has been worth it. This bronze medal proves that all of the sacrifices Alex and his family have made have really been worth it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was cheered on by his parents, his younger brother, his older sister and some friends as well, who travelled to Paris. Given that this is his very first Paralympic Games, I think it's safe to say that we're going to see much more from Alex Saffy in the future. He's a great young man. There's an extraordinary amount of work and commitment going into his role in swimming and as an athlete and an extraordinary amount of sacrifice from his family as well as from him and from our local community. Congratulations, Alex. We look forward to what's ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Today we celebrate a monumental milestone in the history of the Labor Party: 30 years of affirmative action. This policy has transformed our party and reshaped Australian politics for the better, paving the way for a more inclusive and representative government today. As a member of Australia's first ever female majority government, I've had the privilege of serving alongside some of the most inspiring women in politics. Learning and observing from ministers such as the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Minister for Housing and the minister for infrastructure, just to name a few, has been an enriching experience. Throughout my political career, from local government to federal government, I've had the opportunity to work with remarkable elected representatives. Gender diversity makes Labor better. It makes our government stronger, and it makes our country greater. More women in the workforce, around the boardroom and in decision-making positions makes a difference for the better.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Saturday, as New South Wales heads to the voting booths for local government elections, I'm very proud to support outstanding female candidates for council in Bennelong. And, unlike the others, Labor will have females at the top of their tickets. In Ryde, we have Penny Pedersen and Lyndal Howison; in Willoughby, Cathy Duloy will top the Labor ticket for the first time in that local government area; and Katie Little will spearhead our team in her ward in Lane Cove. Their voices will lead to better decisions for our community.</span>

The more things change, the more they stay the same. Indeed, the article also referred to how, speaking over noisy interjections, Mr Hawke—that was the Prime Minister—blamed previous Liberal and National Party federal governments for the high tax and cost structures faced by farmers today. He said the government was doing its best to ensure that farmers received a fair price for their produce on world markets and was aware of the need to contain costs in the rural sector. Yet Mr Hawke actually went and addressed that rally. There were 40,000 farmers out the front of Parliament House protesting against Labor government policies. My father never used to protest, but he did turn up to that one.</span>

I know that the current Prime Minister has been invited to tomorrow's rally, but as yet his office has not responded to that invitation. Here's the test. Will he go out and address those brave farmers who've had their industry taken away from them? The $107 million to stop the industry—that's what the Treasurer had in his budget. Shame on the Treasurer! The Prime Minister should go and address that rally.</span>

Now that's a test of resolve, from the oldest party in the country—diversity, represented on the seats in this House, in this government. It is no surprise that when the Labor Party adopted the affirmative action quota 30 years ago they planned to smash a ceiling—a ceiling that kept women down and out of this place. In doing so, they smashed lots of ceilings. Have a look at the representation and the diversity on this side of the House in this first ever majority female government. But look at the diversity in language, in ethnicity, in background. This government reflects 30 years of a Labor Party determined to represent every electorate in this country.</span>

I'm proud of the women who came before me and proud of the decades of work that they did, influencing people, having those critical conversations to get a party to make a commitment. Carmen Lawrence said on the day we did this that the Liberal Party would have to follow. Carmen got a lot of things right; it's a pity she didn't get that bit right. It's a pity they didn't listen and learn.</span>

There's certainly no cheering on the factory floors, because—newsflash—heavy industry in Western Sydney needs gas. 'Aussie made' is a farce. The biggest risk for insolvencies of businesses is in Western Sydney, in our region. Heavy industry is at risk of closing under this government's renewable-only energy policy.</span>

Guess what? Brickworks needs gas as well. And they're quite concerned that, if we have a blackout or a brownout over summer, they'll be not operational for up to six days. That's extraordinary, for Australia's biggest brick manufacturer. But you know what? They've got bricks lined up for miles—thousands of bricks not being used, because young Australians just can't afford to build their own homes as the costs are just too high. So these bricks are lined up.</span>

On behalf of the government, the parliament and indeed the people of Australia, I want to thank everyone who contributed to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. In particular, I want to acknowledge the Defence Force members, veterans and their families who have shared experiences to shape the final report that will be tabled later today. For many, this meant revisiting the darkest moments of their lives. There were 12 public hearings, 340 witnesses and 900 private sessions. More than 5,800 submissions were made to this royal commission. It is a measure of the extraordinary courage of those involved and a reflection of their great selflessness and their determination to make sure that others are protected from what they have endured.</span>

I also want to recognise some of the families. I note that Julie-Ann Finney is in the gallery today. She did so much to bring this commission about. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal commissions hold a special status in our democracy. They have power to seek the truth about what has happened in the past, but they also carry a weight and status to drive change into the future, to make our nation face up to our collective failures to not do better—and to demand that we do better in the future. This is why the government will thoroughly consider every recommendation, and we want to work across the parliament on these issues and do what we can to ensure that. Just as our veterans and defence personnel step up for our country, we have an obligation to step up for them.</span>

It's a promise we make to remember the fallen, to honour their sacrifice, to care for the loved ones who are left behind and to ensure that all those who have worn the uniform of this nation have access to the support and services they need and deserve. This will be a difficult day for many Australians, but I pay tribute to all those who have endured a difficult day today in order to make tomorrow better for those veterans.</span>

On behalf of the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the shadow minister for defence and all of my colleagues, I join with the government in what necessarily is a bipartisan response to one of the most critical issues facing our country. Our country, particularly because of the values we adhere to, should always treat with respect and dignity those who have served us in uniform, people who have left their families, parents and loved ones to go and fight in another part of the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we remember back to those who came back from the Vietnam War, the shameful way in which our country treated those people on return had an enduring, scarring impact on them individually, on their families and on subsequent generations. When we think about the way in which we have provided support most recently to those who served in the Middle East, many, particularly on successive rotations, having been away from their loved ones and coming back from that high-impact service that they were performing in the Middle East, to expect them to lead a normal life, picking kids up from school or sport—all of that takes an enormous toll. The fact is that, over a long period of time, our country hasn't done well enough in providing support to those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Prime Minister for his words today. I thank all of those who have been involved in providing evidence to the royal commission. As the Prime Minister said, this will be impactful again today for many.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was with the member for Herbert in Townsville only a week or so ago, speaking to some veterans up there about the impact on them—the way in which the services still don't do justice to the support that's required to help them through their mental and physical ailments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence has let people down. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has let people down. Both sides of politics over a long period of time, despite the best of intent, have let these diggers down as well. So, in providing support to those who have given evidence and to those families who remain, we pay tribute to all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the families that I've met with over a long time, including the Halloran family but many others, whose stories will stay with us forever. We must do better in the future to provide support for those who serve us with great dignity and keep our name as a country so well-respected right throughout the world.</span>

That's why we are investing in housing, in skills and energy and in a Future Made in Australia, because, when we came to office, real wages were falling, inflation had a six in front and was rising and interest rates had already started going up. Since we came to office, we have recognised the pressures people are under, we have recognised that growth in our economy is slow, and we have been fighting inflation without ignoring the risks to growth and the pressures people are under. If those opposite were serious about it, instead of opposing our changes to the tax cuts, instead of opposing our cost-of-living relief, instead of opposing getting wages moving, they would have supported it.</span>

Indeed, we know that many Australians are feeling under pressure right now, and easing that cost-of-living pressure is of course our No. 1 priority. We have kept our focus on delivering relief whilst making sure we put downward pressure on inflation at the same time. Since we were last here just a few weeks ago, we made medicines cheaper on the first of this month, with more of them going into the 60-day list—something that those opposite opposed. We have opened more free Medicare urgent care clinics—once again, opposed by those opposite. Energy bill relief was rolled out to more households, and this month over one million households will get an increase in rent assistance. This week we're progressing our plan for super on PPL as well as HECS relief—$3 billion off the HECS bill of Australians. We are introducing legislation this week to deliver a 15 per cent pay rise for early childhood educators. At the same time, we are ensuring that we keep costs down for families who have their children in child care. A typical childcare educator will be $155 a week better off when these rises kick in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, of course, have opposed every cost-of-living relief measure we've provided. We know they support lower wages, not higher wages. We will wait and see what they have to say about the early educators. They've offered no help, no plans for people doing it tough, just relentless, pointless negativity, including their planned $315 billion in cuts. I am asked: have we rejected it? We sure have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the shadow finance minister made it clear. She said, 'I can tell you exactly what we wouldn't have done—that additional $315 billion of spending.' What does that mean to people? It means cuts to the pension, costing $146 a fortnight; cuts to the single parenting payment—$123 a fortnight; cuts to affordable housing; cuts to Medicare and cheaper medicines; and cuts to fee-free TAFE. She's out there saying, 'We're against that $315 billion of spending.' We're cutting the cost of living. The Leader of the Opposition is cutting Medicare, pensions and funding for housing. That is their objective. We're fighting inflation; they're fighting amongst themselves.</span>

The 2026 census will include sexual orientation and gender for the first time. We value every Australian. That's who we are as a political party and as a movement. Now, the ABS came to the government with potential changes it planned to trial, including changes it had not recommended for the 2026 census. We paused that process to get it right. That is precisely what we have done. The government's position follows further engagement with the community and additional discussions with the ABS. We ensured, for example, that only people aged over the age of consent will be asked questions on the new topic and that people can choose not to answer. Regulations to add this new topic will be finalised before the end of the year. This is how you get a commonsense solution—by working with people in order to achieve the objective that we have set.</span>

That goes back to 1998, and ever since then I have argued the case for equality, regardless of people's sexual orientation, regardless of their identity, regardless of their race and regardless of their faith. What the census is about is recording the state of Australia in 2026, and that's precisely what it will do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  Thanks to the honourable member for his question. Since the parliament last sat, we got inflation data which showed that underlying inflation, monthly inflation and non-tradeable inflation all continue to moderate. We also got new numbers last week in the national accounts. What that showed is that the economy barely grew in the June quarter—0.2 per cent and one per cent through the year. That is the slowest growth in our economy since 2020. The basic story of the national accounts was that weaknesses in the household part of the national accounts and private investment were offset by exports and public final demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The weakness in our economy is the inevitable consequence of three things: firstly, global economic uncertainty; secondly, persistent price pressures in our economy; and, thirdly, the impact of higher interest rates on our economy. The main take-out was that consumption is going backwards in our economy right now, discretionary spending fell substantially and household saving is very low. These are all signs, as we know—or at least this side of the House understands—that people are doing it tough, and that's why our cost-of-living help is so important and why it's so important that household incomes grew in the most recent numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, those opposite don't support cost-of-living help. They want higher interest rates. They want a recession for political reasons, and they were very disappointed when they didn't get one. We know this by their reaction right now and we know this from their reaction last week. We also know that, if we had followed their advice, we'd be in recession right now, and we're not. This side of the House is fighting inflation without ignoring the risks to growth and fighting inflation while recognising the pressures that people are under. We're getting the balance right—budget repair, cleaning up the mess that we inherited from those opposite, turning big Liberal deficits into big Labor surpluses, rolling out cost-of-living help, helping in the fight against inflation and investing in housing, skills and energy and in a future made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While two-thirds of the OECD have had at least one negative quarter in recent times, we are managing the economy responsibly. We're rolling out that cost-of-living help, and we're avoiding recession. Here, there's a very important contrast. The Australian people know that we're helping them with the cost of living, we're fighting inflation, we're cleaning up the budget, and we're investing in the future. But we are in the third year of a three-year parliamentary term, and those opposite still have no credible or costed economic policies to speak of. They won't come clean on what their $315 billion in cuts will do to push our economy into recession and what they mean for Medicare, for pensions and payments or for the other services that Australians rely on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The governor made it clear last week in her public comments that she doesn't agree with the assessment put forward by the deputy leader. The second point I'm asked about is cleaning up the mess. It's ironic when you consider the mess that we inherited—turning those deficits to surpluses and getting real wages moving again. Inflation is half of what its peak was in the year that we were elected.</span>

If those opposite don't agree with that, they don't know the first thing about the economy. I say to the deputy leader: don't take your economic advice from the shadow Treasurer, because everybody who looks at this objectively and factually knows that higher interest rates are slowing our economy. We saw it in the numbers for consumption, discretionary spending, households and dwellings, and we saw it in a number of indicators in the national accounts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, when it comes to the fight against inflation, I take responsibility for our part of the fight against inflation. I take responsibility for surpluses, when those opposite only ever delivered deficits. I take responsibility for $80 billion in savings, when those opposite had none in their last budget. I take responsibility for banking almost all of the upward revisions to revenue, when those opposite spent most of it. I take responsibility for helping inflation moderate further, after we inherited much higher inflation from those opposite and it was still going up. I take responsibility for helping the Reserve Bank governor fight inflation without ignoring the risks to growth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't be taking lectures from those opposite, who left us huge deficits and a trillion dollars in debt. They left us with inflation with a six in front of it—and rising. It's the same people who cheer for higher interest rates and a recession because it serves their political interests, the same people who would have us in recession right now but with no help for people who are doing it tough on lower wages, the same people who can't tell us where those $315 billion in secret cuts are coming from and the same people who don't have a costed or credible alternative economic policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:29</span>):  I thank my friend, the sensational member for Pearce, from the great state of WA, for her question. Last week, we signed an agreement with the WA government to fully fund all public schools in Western Australia. What that means is that Western Australia will become the first state in the country to get public schools to that full funding level that David Gonski set all those years ago. It involves the Commonwealth government chipping in. It also involves the WA government chipping in. All up, it's worth an extra $1.6 billion for public schools in WA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not a blank cheque; this money will be tied to real and practical reforms to help our children who fall behind to catch up and to keep up, to see more children finish high school. That's important, because, over the last seven or eight years, we've seen the number of children in public high schools complete high school go backwards, from about 83 per cent down to 73 per cent. That's what we've got to fix. It's what we've got to turn around. It's what this funding is all about—investing in things like a phonics check and a numeracy check in year 1 to identify children, when they're very young, who are already falling behind and need extra help and investing in things like evidence based teaching and catch-up tutoring to make sure they get that extra help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Catch-up tutoring involves getting children out of a class of 25 or 30, four or five days a week, for 40 minutes at a time, into a class where there might be three or four of them and one teacher. What we know is that, when you do that in the right way, a child will learn as much in six months as they would otherwise have learnt in 12 months. In other words, they catch up. In other words, this works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment will also find extra investments in mental health support. There is an obvious link between health and education. We know children who experience mental health challenges are more likely not to be at school and that by year 9, on average, they're about 1½ to three years behind their classmates when it comes to literacy and numeracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to make sure that this money glows in the dark, and that's what this agreement is all about as well. In the next few weeks, I'll introduce legislation to make all of this happen, to lock all of this in. When we do, we know what will happen—the Liberal Party will vote against this. London to a brick, they will vote against this. They've already said as much. They've said they don't think we should be putting extra money into our public schools. Well, good luck explaining that to the parents of WA!</span>

Despite Labor's pre-election promises, under this government, living standards have fallen by nearly nine per cent. The household savings rate is down 10 percentage points. Personal income tax payments are over 25 per cent higher, and a homeowner with a typical mortgage is over $35,000 worse off. Why won't the Prime Minister admit his government has been a disaster, as more Australian families are working harder and longer but still going backwards?</span>

So we make no apologies for the fact that we came into this parliament at the beginning of this year and we changed the Liberals' tax cuts for high-income earners into Labor's tax cuts for every working Australian, all 13.6 million of them, because we want to make sure that people earn more and keep more of what they earn. We make no apologies, either, for coming in here and increasing the wages of aged-care workers, and later this week we'll have legislation to increase the wage for early educators as well. It's these sorts of measures that have seen the gender pay gap reduced to the lowest level in our history, which is something that we are very proud of.</span>

We make no apologies, either, for making sure that our policies have led to the fact that almost one million jobs have been created on our watch. But we're not just dealing with the immediate pressures by providing that cost-of-living support—all of which has been opposed by those opposite. We're also setting up Australia's future, through the Future Made in Australia agenda and by not being frightened of the future but trying to shape it in the interests of working people so that we not only create the jobs through the shift that's happening in the global economy—through things like production tax credits for critical minerals—but also make sure that we train people for those jobs, through our Universities Accord and fee-free TAFE. </span>

Right now, the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hawaii</span>, a Virginia class submarine, is undergoing intermediate-level maintenance at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>, at Rockingham, Western Australia. This is the first time that an American nuclear powered submarine has undergone maintenance outside of the US or a US base, and it's also the first time that non-US citizens have participated in the maintenance of such a submarine. This is a very significant moment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia evolves its capacity to operate Virginia class submarines and indeed its future submarines from HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>, as it establishes the Submarine Rotational Force-West, a critical element of this will be building its ability to engage in the maintenance of these submarines in increasing complexity. That journey really starts with the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Hawaii</span>. It really is the biggest AUKUS moment this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday, the Prime Minister and I were at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>, and we met American and Australian naval personnel working together on this project. We also met a number of employees of ASC, because this is a great opportunity for Western Australian defence industry. In time, we will see thousands of jobs created in Western Australia's naval industry, and it is why the government announced that we will be funding an additional 200 entry-level positions over the next two years at ASC—graduates, trainees and apprentices—so that ASC can have the skilled workforce that it needs but so, at the same time, this great opportunity can be presented to young Western Australians; it's jobs for subs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">AUKUS is happening. Real jobs are now being created, real progress is now being made and real capability is now being built. This is such a contrast to the thought bubble that we inherited from those opposite. When the Liberals were in government, they opened up a 10-year submarine capability gap, and right now that gap is being closed, as we speak, at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>. While the Liberals were all about defence hoopla, the Albanese Labor government is all about real defence action.</span>

We have found almost $80 billion in savings, and those opposite found none in their last budget. We've banked almost all of the upward revision to revenue in our budgets; those opposite used to spend most of the upward revisions to revenue in the budgets. We've been managing the budget in a very responsible way, getting the budget in much better nick and cleaning up the mess that we inherited from those opposite at the same time as we roll out cost-of-living relief—</span>

So, if they don't want to take my word for it, they can take the word of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has made it very clear that we are aligned when it comes to the fight against inflation. It's one of the reasons we've got inflation down from something that had a six in front of it when they were in office to something that has a three in front of it right now. We know that these price pressures are more persistent than we would like, and that's why it requires ongoing effort. Our primary focus is the fight against inflation, as is the Reserve Bank's. We know that we need to do that without ignoring the risks to growth and the pressures that people are already under.</span>

They'd be running huge deficits, rather than a couple of big surpluses, and that would have implications. We're managing the budget responsibly. It's the third year of a three-year parliamentary term, and they don't have any policies.</span>

He knows that great Aussie ideas lead to great products and great, secure, well-paying jobs. We know the right support at the right time for emerging Australian manufacturers is crucial to securing those jobs. Our $400 million Industry Growth Program is setting us up for a future made in Australia by doing exactly that. There's the $3.1 million that the IGP is providing for Seed Terminator, a family business in Adelaide which is looking to expand its exports. The brainchild of a South Australian engineer, Nick Berry, Seed Terminator's harvester attachment smashes 99 per cent of weed seeds—chemical-free—dramatically increasing crop efficiency. Then there is the $4.3 million the IGP is providing in support of Cauldron Molecules, in the electorate of Calare, to scale up their world-leading hyper-fermentation demonstration facility to full industrial production. As co-founder Michele Stansfield says, critical support helps position Australia as a global leader in biomanufacturing, tapping into a $700 billion global market. Backing Aussie knowhow to make more things here, create more secure, well paid regional jobs—that's our approach.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked if there are any approaches that have been rejected: the coalition have offered those approaches in spades, and they're all awful. Their approach, weighed down by a shameful legacy, was driving out manufacturers in jobs while in government and then refusing to back anything to strengthen manufacturers while in opposition. In their frenzied rush to talk down manufacturing, the mouths are working, not so much the brains. I'll give a few examples from our Future Made in Australia Bill and the debate around it. The member for Sturt declared, 'We are not the party of picking winners,' yet he was in the government that invested billions to bring Moderna and mRNA manufacturing to Australia. The member for Groom asked, 'Do we choose to be directed more firmly by the government, or do we allow the invisible hand to make its way?'—the same invisible hand that, brick by brick, will magically build the nuclear power plants funded entirely by taxpayer dollars. The member for Mitchell, fresh from dusting a Milton Friedman statue, levered off his philosophical manner to warn that Milton Friedman spoke about the misallocation of government capital and the increase in government spending—perhaps he penned that dire warning about misallocating government capital in a commuter car park that was built nowhere near a train station!

With our economy recently recording the weakest annual financial year growth in years, small to medium sized family owned businesses are struggling. Yet these business owners from North Sydney and beyond, and tax experts, have raised serious concerns with me about the Australian Taxation Office's aggressive debt-enforcement action increasingly targeting them. Treasurer, will your government issue guidance or a mandate to the ATO to ensure debt-collection processes targeting small to medium sized businesses are conducted in a way that recognises tough economic times?</span>

I also acknowledge the member for Warringah, who raises these matters with me from time to time as well. This is something that I speak with the Commissioner of Taxation about from time to time, because I understand that in the context of an economy where growth is slow and subdued, and consumption is weak—particularly when it comes to discretionary spending—a lot of small businesses, like a lot of Australians, are doing it tough. We do need to make sure that the ATO does its important work, which is recovering tax debts so that we make sure there is a level playing field between the people who do their best to keep up to date and those who are unable to. We need to make sure that there's an even playing field. But, whenever these activities are undertaken, we need to make sure that they are undertaken in the most sensitive and understanding way that they can be. My advice to small businesses who are in the situation that the member for North Sydney describes, is to engage as early as possible with the ATO to come to the arrangements that they need in order to keep doing the really important work that they do in our economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From our point of view, we will continue doing what we can to support small businesses, whether it's through a bit of help with energy bills, tax breaks or in other ways. We are big supporters of small business. We know it's a tough time for them and we want the ATO to recognise that as well.</span>

It is the source of well-paid jobs and billions of dollars of investment from right around the world, and it will help drive our Future Made in Australia to capitalise on the world's transition to net zero.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's budget in May put the resources industry at the heart of government policymaking. We have committed to $17 billion for a production tax incentive for critical minerals to encourage onshore processing and $3.4 billion for the Resourcing Australia's Prosperity program so that Geoscience Australia can identify deposits of critical minerals and map our future. It was the most significant federal budget for the resources sector in a generation, because we support the resources sector through industry backed policy not by simply attending dinners and parties in the Pilbara.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been alternative approaches, and we have rejected them. For instance, we won't measure our support for the industry by the number of resources ministers we have at any one time. We also won't kick the resources portfolio around like a political football, kicking it out of the cabinet room because of a Nationals leadership squabble. What the opposition are doing is standing in the way of a production tax incentive and doing communities out of jobs and investments.</span>

                  </a>  We have financed seven important resources projects under the NAIF and more under the CMF. The seven resources projects will create more than 7,000 jobs in resources, which is more than double what the opposition managed to do with the NAIF when they were in government, and the total value of those seven resources projects is $13 billion, which is more than quadruple the support those opposite ever provided to the sector via the NAIF.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What those opposite are doing is worse than nothing. By standing in the way of production tax credits, they are standing in the way of jobs in their communities. It beggars belief that those opposite have absolutely no problem with government loans that necessarily assume a higher risk because of the challenges, but they oppose industry led policy that is no risk because it provides investment incentives and is paid out only on success. These economic dunderheads on the other side of the House want to break up Qantas and Jetstar. They want to boycott Woolies. They want government owned and run nuclear power plants, but they won't back industry led production tax credits for a critical minerals processing sector.</span>

Regis Resources has confirmed the Blayney gold mine is no longer viable following the minister's decision to block a critical part of the project against the advice of the legislated authority, the local Aboriginal land council. Why won't the minister release the statement of reasons for her decision that has jeopardised a $1 billion investment and some 800 jobs and creates sovereign risk which will see companies withdraw investment from Australia?</span>

It's interesting that he suggested that the company doesn't believe that the project is viable, because the chairman has just bought 15,000 extra shares and one of the other directors has just bought more than 10,000 extra shares with his wife. The CEO and his wife, through Deckchair Trust, have bought more than 10,000 extra shares. But, just to be very clear here, I have not blocked the gold mine. What I've said is, of this 2½-thousand-hectare site, 400 hectares ought to be protected. I've done it on the basis of advice from the same group of traditional owners as the former minister for the environment—</span>

Of course, family, domestic and sexual violence destroys lives, and it must end. Since the day we were elected, our government have made the safety of women and children experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence a national priority. Our government, along with states and territories, are united in our efforts under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. The national plan is a road map for change and was developed in partnership with victims-survivors and outlines our shared goals of ending violence against women and children in a generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has already invested more than $3.4 billion into women's safety, and this investment is guided by our national plan. Last Friday, as part of this government's concerted effort, the Prime Minister convened all states and territories for the second dedicated National Cabinet meeting on gender based violence. The Commonwealth, along with all states and territories, confirmed further action to tackling family, domestic and sexual violence. Part of this extra effort, announced by the Albanese Labor government, was an extra $4.4 billion in investment to fund action. As part of ensuring support for victims-survivors, frontline legal services will benefit from the largest injection of funding to the legal assistance sector in the last 20 years. Our government will also provide much needed support for family, domestic and sexual violence frontline services through a five-year national partnership agreement, with funding to be matched by states and territories. This will provide long-term funding certainty and focus on specialised services for women, services to support children exposed to family, domestic and sexual violence and services working with men, including men's behaviour change programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the Albanese Labor government is providing $80 million to expand existing programs that support children and young people to address the impact of violence on children's development and wellbeing. Our government will also lead the development of national minimum standards for men's behaviour change programs to ensure that these programs make a real difference. Along with that we will develop a new best practice family and domestic violence risk assistance principles and framework. Of course, the Attorney-General will also be leading work with jurisdictions to improve information sharing and policing response for high-risk perpetrators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has and will taking continue substantial action under our national plan to end violence against women and children. We all have a role to play to end violence in one generation, and our government will work with everyone—governments, business, communities and individuals—to achieve this goal.</span>

The Woodside Barracks, established in 1927, is historically, militarily and economically important for my Mayo community. The base also hosts over 100 Army and Air Force cadets—regional young people, many of whom are interested in a military career. Will the Woodside Barracks remain an operational base, and will you rule out selling off the land as currently speculated?</span>

As the member would be aware, the government has undertaken a review into the Defence Estate to ensure that the Defence Estate is the appropriate platform that it should be for the Defence Force that we need and for the Defence Force to achieve the strategic aims that we need it to in what is a very difficult world. I'm not going to go into the specifics of any defence site and walk down the path of that before the government releases its response to the estate review. We are currently in the process of working that response through. We've received the report from those who have undertaken it. We need to be ensuring that all the implications in relation to personnel associated with the thorough review of our Defence Estate are completely worked through, and that will take some months to do. It is not our intention to respond to the review until some time next year because of the work that is involved in relation to that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I acknowledge what the member has said about the Woodside Barracks and its significance. Of course, pretty much every member of this place will have a part of the Defence Estate within their electorate. Defence is one of, if not the biggest, landowner in the country, so this is an important process to go through. But, as I say, the government is working this through in detail, and I'm very happy to brief the member at greater detail at a later stage.</span>

The Prime Minister's announcement, following a National Cabinet meeting on Friday, was very significant, demonstrating the commitment of the Albanese Labor government to ending violence against women and children in a generation. As the Prime Minister said on Friday, the $4.7 billion package includes $3.9 billion for the five-year National Access to Justice Partnership, and that includes an $800 million increase on current funding levels for the legal assistance sector plus—and this is very significant—a commitment to ongoing funding.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every part of the legal assistance sector will benefit from this $800 million boost, which will be shared between community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, women's legal services, legal aid commissions and family violence prevention legal services. It's the biggest single investment in the legal assistance sector ever by the Commonwealth. This package will provide pay parity for the community legal centre sector so that lawyers and other workers in community legal centres, Aboriginal legal services, women's legal services and FVPLSs—themselves mostly women because most of the workers in this sector are women—will no longer have to accept being paid up to 30 per cent less than their counterparts in legal aid commissions. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal assistance providers such as the Northern Community Legal Centre, which serves the electorate of Wills, are on the frontline of the fight to end gender based violence, but community legal centres, including women's legal centres, are currently turning away up to 1,000 people per day. This investment in legal assistance will ensure that those services can help more Australians. This investment in legal assistance services will ensure that these services can help more women, including First Nations women, safely leave and recover from violent relationships.</span>

Interest rates have come down in the UK, Canada and New Zealand, so why won't the Treasurer take responsibility for the weakest GDP growth outside the pandemic since Paul Keating's 1990s recession? </span>

                  </a>  A couple of things about that: first of all, the honourable member made the point about interest rates in other countries. A number of the other countries that those opposite cite have higher unemployment than us, they have higher interest rates than us and their inflation peaked higher and earlier than us, so, if they want to make comparisons with other countries, make the full comparison. Do they want the much higher unemployment that we see in some of these countries that they cite—Canada and New Zealand and the like? They should be upfront about that when they ask these questions with international comparisons. We know they desperately want higher interest rates to serve their political purposes. We know that they desperately want a recession in this country to serve their political purposes. We know they won't come clean on the impact of their $315 billion in cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about taking responsibility. As I said a moment ago to the shadow Treasurer, before he was benched again, I take responsibility for our part in the fight against inflation, and in doing so I take responsibility in working with all these colleagues to deliver two surpluses that those opposite were incapable of delivering. I take responsibility for $80 billion in savings when those opposite had zero dollars in savings in their last budget. I take responsibility for banking almost all the upward revisions to revenue when those opposite used to fritter those upward revisions away. I take responsibility for the fact that the day that we arrived in office, inflation was 6.1 per cent and now it has a three in front of it. I take responsibility for maintaining this primary focus on the fight against inflation at the same time as we recognise—alone in this place—that people are already under pressure and growth in the economy is already soft and subdued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I say once again that, when it comes to responsible economic management, I will not be taking lectures from those opposite, who left us huge deficits. They left us a trillion dollars in Liberal debt, a budget full of waste and rorts and mismanagement. The same people who cheer for higher interest rates, the same people who want inflation to go up, the same people who would have us in recession right now if we had followed their advice—their time would be better spent coming clean to the Australian people about what their $315 billion in secret cuts means for Medicare, for pensions and for the economy. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  I thank the member for Bendigo for her question and for her tireless championing of regional aviation, particularly the investment in Bendigo Airport. Of course, this government is implementing the most significant reforms to Australian aviation in a decade. Over recent years the performance of our aviation sector has not been good enough—poor passenger services; customers being left waiting for refunds; travellers with a disability facing shameful treatment. Our government saw the need to act, and we are acting. Through the aviation white paper, along with our major reforms to Sydney airport, we are increasing consumer protection through the creation of the first ombudsperson to cover the sector. We are creating a charter of consumer rights, we are increasing transparency on airline performance, we are increasing access to Sydney Airport to boost competition and, of course, we are building Western Sydney international airport. CHOICE have said that they 'strongly welcome' the reforms, the Tourism and Transport Forum called our reforms a 'significant step forward' towards creating a stronger aviation sector, the Airports Association said that our reforms put 'passengers first', and the ASU said that this is our chance to make Australian airlines 'the envy of the world'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked what approaches the government has rejected. What we have rejected, frankly, is the lazy and tired approach that those opposite took when they were in government. When they were in government they did absolutely nothing to reform aviation. They didn't act on consumer rights, they didn't act on disability rights and they didn't act on competition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we all woke up this morning to see the shadow transport spokesperson having a bit of a big idea. She's decided that she wants divestiture of Jetstar, breaking up aviation and seeing Jetstar go the way of Tigerair. You would think any serious political party would have thought deeply about such a significant policy, but this thought bubble didn't last the light of day. While Australians were still having breakfast, the member for New England and Senator Hume refused to back it in, quite rightly, and just after breakfast the Leader of the Nationals quite rightly killed it dead forever. That's it. He not only confirmed that it hadn't been to shadow cabinet; he said, 'Well, it's not coalition policy, because we haven't got the evidence.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By lunchtime, not even Senator McKenzie backed Senator McKenzie, who was forced to front a press conference to walk back her comments. This is another evidence-free and damaging thought bubble from people who have proved once again why they can't be trusted with managing Australia's economy. The only divestment the Liberal Party should have a good look at and now consider is divesting themselves of this loose National Party.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I present the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide final report, volumes 1 to 7. In doing so, I say that the Albanese government welcomes this report. As the Prime Minister said earlier today at the beginning of question time, I'd like to acknowledge the many people across this parliament who have advocated for this royal commission, of which the report is its product. I particularly want to acknowledge Julie-Ann Finney, who is in the gallery today. I know and the Prime Minister knows—and I am aware that so many across this parliament know—that this report would not have been tabled today but for Julie-Ann's advocacy. I have had the honour of meeting Julie-Ann and hearing firsthand her story, and her advocacy has been singularly brave. I want to say to Julie-Ann: this report is for David and for the many others like him who have worn our nation's uniform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government called for the royal commission when in opposition, in December 2019, and the Morrison government commissioned the royal commission in July 2021. Throughout this time the royal commission conducted 12 public hearing blocks, comprising 340 witnesses, 900 private sessions and more than 5,800 submissions. The report and its 122 recommendations over seven volumes and more than 3,000 pages mark the culmination of the most significant, the most comprehensive inquiry conducted into suicide and suicidality in the defence and veterans communities. The government thanks all of those who were brave enough to contribute to the inquiry, those who told their story and came forward to give their evidence. That act of bravery has made an enormous difference. The government also wants to thank the royal commissioners, Nick Kaldas APM, the Hon. James Douglas KC and Dr Peggy Brown AO, for their thorough and compassionate inquiry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we have continued to demonstrate our commitment to improving the welfare of defence personnel, veterans and their families. We've been working to deliver real change each and every day. In August 2022, the government acted swiftly to table the interim report of the royal commission and, in the process, agreed to implement all of its recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wearing our nation's uniform is a sacred act. It is an act of service to all of us. It is an act of humility. Inherent in the act is putting one's comrades-in-arms, one's community and the nation ahead of oneself. Most significantly, it is an innate act of sacrifice—each and every day, where so many of those days are spent away from family and friends—in the sense that in that most critical moment, that darkest hour, there is a willingness when wearing our nation's uniform to lay down one's life in complete commitment to the decisions which are made in this building on behalf of each and every one of us. So it is utterly incumbent upon us to do honour to those who wear our nation's uniform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the distinct pleasure and privilege of meeting so many who have made this choice. I understand what a special group of people they are, who decide to wear our nation's uniform. It is most important that we do everything within our power to make sure that the environment in which they operate is the best that it can be. Our government's priority is to ensure that those who pursue a career in the ADF have a safe and inclusive workplace and are supported from the time they join through to transition and service. The royal commission's final report and recommendations will strengthen our approach to the mental health and welfare of defence personnel, veterans and families. We will now work through the recommendations in a timely and methodical manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, as the Prime Minister said earlier, recognises that today may be a mixed and difficult day, involving significant emotions for people. If you are struggling or in need of extra support, please know there are services available to you: Lifeline on 131114 and Open Arms Veterans and Families Counselling on 1800011046. The government is committed to responding to this report shortly. We will do so soon, in a manner which is timely. We will do so with complete thoroughness, because those who wear our nation's uniform deserve nothing less.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  on indulgence—I, too, would like to recognise the presence here today of Julie-Ann Finney and acknowledge her great loss of Dave. There were around 3,000 Daves—lives lost tragically to suicide—between 1997 and 2021.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility in this nation. If someone signs their name on the dotted line—therefore they offer their life for this land—we have to protect them when they come home. There is something wrong when a person is more likely to die once they've finished their service and get back onto civvy street than they are when they're actually in the service. I hope that, on a bipartisan level, we can work to our very best on this. I'd like the minister—I acknowledge he's here at present—to expedite this process, to get it through and get it resolved out of respect for those who have died.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge those in the chamber who have served—the members for Canning, Herbert, Braddon, Menzies, Leichhardt, Solomon and Spence—and all the other reservists who have served. When people do this, they are making sure that our nation is safe. You can't have a superannuation fund, a house, a business or a future if you don't have a nation, if it's just not present. For us to have that nation, we have to have people, men and women, who are prepared to serve.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who have tragically died are someone's mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter, and that hole in that family's life, in that circle of people's lives, will remain with them forever. The questions as to why remain with them forever. The photos of their family member in a service uniform will stay on the mantelpiece for as long as they are alive and then be handed on, with pride, to family members. Those who serve our nation are from families of honour because they offer their lives for the future betterment of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to this report being handed down, and I look forward to doing what we can, on this side, to work with the minister in good nature and with honour to make sure whatever can be done is done as quickly and as properly as possible, so that people such as Dave are remembered. We can never bring him back, but, Julie-Ann, the respect we can show is that we have taken this very seriously and to the best of our ability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge those who were so fully in support of bringing this forward and the fights that they've had. This was an issue as to which, at the start, there might have been some conjecture, but, once it was in train, there was not one doubt whatsoever that this was an item of the utmost importance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have moved these amendments because I believe that this bill could be of much greater benefit to our nation, and, in particular, country Australia, if areas of priority were expanded to include food processing and agriculture. We saw during COVID how vulnerable nations were when their supply chains were cut and put at risk. Food security must be a key priority of our country, and food processing is one area in which Australia does have a very strong competitive advantage. We've heard about that, time and time again in this debate—competitive advantage. Our processing plants are in close proximity to our primary producers, and it's one area of our economy which requires strong support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned in this House, on a previous occasion, the enormous food processing industries that are operating in the Central West, from Chiko Rolls at Bathurst and canola oil at Manildra to Tic Tacs and Nutella at Lithgow. Our area, in the Central West of New South Wales, is a powerhouse of food processing, and it is of concern to me that this sector has been inexplicably overlooked in this legislation. Food processing needs all the support it can get. Our manufacturers need all the support they can get. They're a huge employer in our area, and it really surprises me that food processing has not been identified as a key area of national priority and support. This package will deliver tens of billions of dollars, but none of it will go to ensuring that Australia has food security and the associated jobs that go with it. It's a glaring oversight of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another glaring oversight of this bill is the lack of support for agriculture. The wealth of our nation has to be based on production. Australia has the best produce in the world. The food basket of our country is located in regional Australia and, in particular, in central western New South Wales, and it defies belief that the agriculture sector has not been identified as an area of priority for this bill. The gross value of agricultural production has increased by 51 per cent in the past 20 years to $94.3 billion in 2022-23, and, if you look back to the global financial crisis and the crisis brought on by the pandemic, you will see that one of the key sectors which carried us through was agriculture. It is a vital plank in the economic foundations of this country, and we must support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some exciting developments happening in agriculture, which I've previously outlined for this House and which the member for Kennedy enthusiastically endorsed, including initiatives that benefit both farmers and the environment, such as the conversion of atmospheric CO2 to soil carbon, which not only increases yield but allows farmers to make an extra dollar as well. So it's highly surprising that agriculture has not been a part of the conversation surrounding this bill. Our farmers and our food processors deserve much better, as do the supply chains that support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Food processing and agriculture need to be areas of priority for this bill and for the billions of dollars that it will deliver, and it will be very disappointing if these key amendments aren't supported. I'm reserving my position on the bill until I hear what the Treasurer has to say, but, if the answer is that maybe food processing and agriculture can be included sometime in the future, that would be very disappointing and would be a real shame. We need to pin the colours to the mast now and come out and emphatically back agriculture and food processing. Let's not wait. Let's not think about it. Let's back these amendments and get it done now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To members of the Liberal and National parties, I would say to you: back these amendments. Tomorrow there are going to be farmers right here in Canberra from all over the country, so I ask you to stand up for them, stand up for our food processing industries and support these amendments. I urge all members of this place to stand up for agriculture and stand up for our food processors. I also urge all members of this House to stand up for the men and women who feed and clothe our nation and the world. I urge all members of this House to back these amendments and support agriculture and food processing in regional Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear. I support this bill's intention because I support measures to get to net zero emissions by 2050. We must focus on this goal if we are to have any hope at all of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. The Future Made in Australia plan put forward by the government is an important pillar to reaching this goal by helping to unlock renewable energy resources and future-focused manufacturing. My community sent me here as their Independent to work towards strong action on climate change but they also sent me here to be a strong legislator, to be their champion for integrity in government decision-making and spending. While in principle I support the bill as a measure towards net zero, I have deep concerns about integrity when it comes to this program because we're talking about tens of billions of taxpayer dollars—$22.7 billion to be exact. In anyone's measure, that is an enormous amount of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, the bill as drafted does not give the public a clear and timely line of sight on where their money is going. Instead, the government have only given a vague outline of how the money might be spent, and, when it comes to the fine print, the guardrails, the rigour, they say, 'That will come later; please trust us.' But without this fine print, without an oversight and transparency framework, there is a risk that money will be awarded to industries and companies without merit because of lobbying efforts, because it could win votes in certain electorates. With that concern comes an erosion of public confidence in the Future Made in Australia Bill itself. The government have not shown us they are putting integrity right upfront when planning to spend this money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to lead the nation through the momentous transformation to net zero, this government needs public trust above all else. And I'm not alone in raising these issues. The recent Senate inquiry into this bill uncovered the following from respected organisations and businesses. The Grattan Institute said that the bill doesn't currently have enough guardrails to prevent the risk of pork-barrelling. The Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce specifically raised concerns about processes under the bill. They said there absolutely needs to be public confidence that the system is not being used for the wrong purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments I'm putting forward aim to address some of these concerns. They are simple and straightforward, yet they would give the public greater assurance about how their money is being spent. My amendments would, firstly, require the minister to give unredacted sector assessments to the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit so there is a fulsome parliamentary mechanism to ensure Future Made in Australia supports are given to sectors where it is appropriate to do so. Secondly, they would require sector assessments to be tabled in parliament within seven sitting days of the minister receiving that assessment. Currently the bill says '30 sitting days'. In practical terms this means that, if the minister were to receive a report on 2 December 2024, it would not be required to be tabled in this parliament until around 25 June 2025, some 127 business days after the minister has received it. In my view this is far too long for tabling a report in order to serve its transparency and accountability function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my amendments would specify what should be included in a Future Made in Australia annual report. I acknowledge that the Treasurer intends to move a government amendment that goes to this point, and I'm grateful for that, but this amendment has less detail than my amendments. Again, it is not nearly enough to achieve its intended transparency objective. My amendment would require annual reports to specify the total amount of Future Made in Australia supports, the recipient of these supports, the purpose of the support, and the kind of support provided and the amount of support provided to and spent by that recipient. These transparency measures are missing from the government's proposed amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, these are simple amendments, and I thank the Treasurer and his office for engaging with me in the way that they have, but I must say I am disappointed that my amendments and those of my fellow crossbenchers, which all speak to this issue of transparency and accountability, have been responded to in a rather piecemeal fashion. If the Future Made in Australia plan is indeed going to seize the opportunities of the move to renewable energy, then the government has work to do to shore up taxpayer confidence and trust in its plans to spend $22.7 billion of the very same taxpayer money. I would argue that my amendments will help fix the holes in the government's current plan, and I urge the government to support my amendments. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The five amendments from the government that are before the House are largely about three things.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the amendments will make the sector assessments more rigorous. They will put in legislation the recommendation for Treasury to consult expert bodies when making these assessments, and this will help Treasury consider what impact or benefit individual industries will have on our net zero transformation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the amendments clarify the importance of First Nations Australians participating in and sharing the benefits of our transition to net zero, with an extra community benefit principle ensuring the benefits of projects on those communities are always properly considered. We're also proposing a minor amendment to the omnibus bill to ensure that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency is considered a public authority of the Commonwealth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are all about helping to make Australia a renewable energy superpower, making sure that it's Australians who benefit from our transition to net zero. Making our future here in Australia is about making the most of our nation's potential and making sure everyone shares in the benefits. This legislation will help us maximise the economic and industrial benefits of international move to net zero, and secure Australia's place at the forefront of the changing global economic and strategic landscape.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the crossbench for working closely and collaboratively with us on the amendments and on these bills. Their thoughtful and creative suggestions will strengthen the Future Made in Australia legislation, and I move these amendments in lieu of their constructive proposals. These two bills together are a major step in implementing the Albanese Labor government's Future Made in Australia agenda to deliver our country's next generation of prosperity, and that's why I commend the bills to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I briefly rise in support of several of the amendments moved by the government, particularly those which go to consultation transparency requirements. The government amendments indicate that Treasury will consult with the Productivity Commission and others when conducting sector assessments under the National Interest Framework. This is a positive step, and aligns with the amendments I put forward during the second reading debate, as well as those put forward by the member for Kooyong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the government has legitimate reasons for retaining ownership of the sector assessment process within Treasury; however, I'm very glad that the government has acknowledged that the Productivity Commission has deep expertise and experience in conducting similar kinds of analyses. For instance, the PC's annual trade and assistance review covers much of the same ground as the sector assessments proposed in this bill, and the commission have established a robust and road-tested set of methodologies for looking at the consequences of different forms of government intervention. The commission will also, I believe, contribute a healthy degree of independence and scepticism to the process. Again, I note the comments that its chair, Danielle Wood, has made in relation to some of the announcements made regarding the Future Made in Australia legislation so far. The Productivity Commission are experts, and we would be foolish not to consider their views. Embedding consultation sends a strong signal of the robustness and independence of the sector assessment process, and should prevent a situation where this or any future government could bypass their feedback in favour of their own pet projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the government and, particularly, the Treasurer and his staff for engagement on these issues, and for a very constructive set of amendments in relation to these areas.</span>

The considerations that the member mentioned in her question will be a part of the Treasury's considerations.</span>

You'll recall, Treasurer, that I moved an amendment to this effect out of genuine concern about women and girls, particularly, being included in the renewable energy revolution. Are you confident that the legislation, as it stands, addresses this?</span>

As a demonstration of our bona fides here, a big part of our skills agenda, for example, when it comes to the energy transformation, is a focus on women. When we say that we want communities to benefit from the additional investment that we will leverage in the net zero transformation, we don't mean 49 per cent of those communities; we mean everyone. We want to make sure that women are big beneficiaries of what we're proposing here. While I've got the microphone: we're also very grateful for the encouragement from the member for Goldstein when it comes to the First Nations community benefit principles.</span>

To remind you, Treasurer, it was a very straightforward amendment. It was simply that it be explicitly excluded that this funding arrangement provide any funding for fossil fuel, carbon capture and storage, or nuclear projects. Although the government did not support my amendment, are you able to, here and now, put into the record of the parliament a categorical statement that no funding will be available for any fossil fuel, carbon capture and storage, or nuclear project or proposal?</span>

The way that we have tried to come at this issue that he has raised in good faith is that the explanatory memorandum now makes it clear that the independent sector assessments in the National Interest Framework will take into consideration the role the sector will play in the net zero transformation, including its direct emissions impact and its role in net zero supply chains. I assure the member that the Future Made in Australia legislation, and the policy more broadly that I announced from this dispatch box at budget time, is focused very firmly on the net zero transformation, on making Australia a renewable energy superpower and on tens of billions of dollars being invested in renewables and industries which are central to that transformation. I believe and the government believes that we can make ourselves indispensable to that global net zero transformation, and the legislation reflects that.</span>

The focus here is not on gas. The focus is on renewable hydrogen. It's about value-adding in critical minerals. It's about looking at sustainable aviation fuels, green metals and the industries that we have identified.

There has been an abundance of rigour when it comes to that investment of $470 million—a combination of different kinds of investments—in PsiQuantum, and that's because quantum computing is an absolutely essential part of the future economy, and we want to make sure that Australia is part of that. As the honourable member rightly identifies in her question, there is an economic element to it but also an element around national security and resilience. In the future economy, quantum computing will play a very big role, and we want Australia to play a role in that as well.</span>

Will the person or body be required to evidence how they have had regard to the principles? If yes, how will this be documented? If no, why not?

Just so you're clear: with consideration in detail, when the Treasurer is going back and forth and answering questions regarding detailed amendments, that is detailed amendments before the House. We've finished the detailed amendments. I don't think the member for Casey has detailed amendments; he has questions. Those are two different things, detailed amendments and questions. Where we're at in the stage of dealing with the bill is that we've agreed with all of the amendments. So the question now is that this bill as amended be agreed to.</span>

The minister has put a bill before the House this afternoon which relates to amendments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, now known as Export Finance Australia. This bill, including the amendment which the government has just moved, seeks to make some amendments to the Future Made in Australia Bill that the government had brought forward. Of course the Future Made in Australia Bill and, in particular, the omnibus amendments, for example, deal with Export Finance Australia.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, for clarification, the manager is correct: the debate we're having at the moment is around the amendment that's been agreed to, so we're not in consideration in detail. It's part of the process, but we've finished the consideration in detail and we've finished the amendments. All the debate the House is looking at now is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  In 2008, the former minister for youth Kate Ellis released a report into the impact of voluntary student unionism on services, amenities and representation for Australian university students. This report suggested that the defunding of student led organisations in the early 2000s had a negative impact on the provision of services and amenities for Australian university students as well as on their ability to participate in university governance and decision-making. By returning funding to student led organisations and providing them with secure funding, we will enable greater services, representation and advocacy for students. It will also ensure more consistent service provisions across the country, making sure that all students, regardless of where they study, have access to the support they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms build on the government's first set of changes under the Higher Education Support Amendment (Response to the Australian Universities Accord Interim Report) Act 2023. The interim report act removed the strict 50 per cent pass rule, which disproportionately forced lower SES and regional students to drop out. Instead of penalising students who may be struggling to adapt to their new adult life, we are requiring universities to provide the support necessary for their success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also expanded the demand driven system to include all Indigenous students. This is a crucial step in closing the gap and addressing the generational inequality that many of our Indigenous Australians face. With this change, the government aims to double the number of Indigenous Australians with a university degree within a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interim act also doubled the number of university study hubs from 34 to 68, including 20 in regional Australia and 14 in the outer suburbs. These hubs were designed so that students in the outer suburbs, such as Cranbourne, Hampton Park and Clyde, have access to university services close to their homes. This is about bringing education closer to the people, ensuring that distance is no longer a barrier to higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 is a step forward in our nation's history. It is a demonstration of our commitment to education as a cornerstone of our future. By reducing student debt, supporting our essential workers to complete their placements, expanding access to university prep courses and ensuring strong student representation, we are laying the foundation for a more equitable higher education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our education system should be a beacon of opportunity, accessible to all, regardless of background or circumstances. This bill takes us one step closer to that vision. It is a step towards a fairer and more equitable higher education system. It is a step towards a future where every Australian will have the chance to reach their full potential and contribute to the success of our great nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, for his hard work on this bill. Thank you for standing up for working-class students and those from the outer suburbs, like Holt. It is truly commendable to see a minister who places communities like Holt at the heart of our nation's future rather than as an afterthought. I commend the bill to the House and urge all my colleagues to support it wholeheartedly.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024. This bill implements recommendations of the Universities Accord final report, which was released in February this year. The Universities Accord involved an expert panel, led by Professor Mary O'Kane, and it undertook vitally important work that produced a long-term plan for our university sector. In particular, I want to recognise panel member the Hon. Fiona Nash, who is Australia's first Regional Education Commissioner and a former minister for regional development. I acknowledge her particularly important role on the panel in advocating for university students from regional and rural Australia. Indi, a regional electorate, has one of the lowest rates of higher education attainment in the country. Just 17 per cent of Indi residents have a bachelor's degree or more, compared to the national average of 26 per cent, and we must close this gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements four recommendations of the Universities Accord. Firstly, it will cap the indexation rate for all HELP loans, more commonly known as HECS, to the consumer price index or the wage price index, whichever is lowest, and backdate this to 1 June 2023. Secondly, the bill provides for the creation of a weekly prac payment, a new form of income support for students who are required to undertake unpaid placements in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work. Thirdly, the bill establishes a new Commonwealth grant scheme for fee-free uni-ready courses so that more students can access bridging courses to transition to university. I was pleased to meet recently with La Trobe University's vice-chancellor, who emphasised that this measure would help more regional students enrol in university. Finally, the bill requires higher education providers to allocate a minimum of 40 per cent of revenue from student services and amenities fees to student-led organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support all of these measures and I want to draw particular attention to the first two: capping the HECS indexation rate and the new Commonwealth prac payments. More than 14,000 people in my electorate currently have HECS debts, amounting to $300 million in total debt. It is a staggering amount for our electorate, and, with more than 10 per cent in indexation applied to these debts in the last two years, it means around $30 million in extra debt in Indi in that time, just because of indexation. I know that rising debts are causing rising concern right across my electorate and, indeed, right across the nation. It is making it harder to balance study and work, harder to save for a home and harder to have a family. Debts are hanging around longer, and it will take many of today's young people decades to pay them off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that ballooning levels of debt will discourage young regional Australians from pursuing higher education, that it will discourage more working Australians from upskilling or making a career change, that it will deny more people the opportunity to build a meaningful and rewarding career and that it will set regional communities such as mine back. The Universities Accord agreed, stating that the status quo risks:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… deterring some people from seeking higher education at exactly the time we need growth in participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regional Australia, I know how desperately we need more teachers, nurses, engineers, planners and agricultural scientists, just to name a few professions. Frankly, if debts continue to grow like we've seen in recent years, then we have Buckley's chance of meeting the government's 80 per cent higher education target by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I support reform to HECS. The Universities Accord recommended significant reform, including ensuring that debts don't increase faster than wages. The government is now delivering on that recommendation, and I heartily commend them for that. But let's be clear: that would not have happened without the strong advocacy of the crossbench. This change came on the back of a petition led by the member for Kooyong that amassed more than 288,000 signatures, making it one of the largest petitions in Australian political history, calling on the government to fix the broken HECS debt system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes in this bill will wipe more than $3 billion in debt across Australia and many millions of dollars in communities across my electorate. It will soften the blow caused by sky-high inflation but it will not fix many of the underlying issues. There is more work to do. HECS is not fixed yet. I support the Universities Accord recommendation and amendments put forward by my crossbench colleagues to change the timing of indexation to deduct compulsory repayments before applying indexation. The status quo is unfairly adding thousands of dollars to Australians HECS debts and it could be fixed. In a cost-of-living crisis, this simply isn't good enough. I support the calls from the member for Goldstein and the member for Warringah to change the unfair timing of HECS debt indexation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the changes to HECS indexation, the introduction of Commonwealth prac payments was another welcome budget announcement. The new prac payment, around $319.50 per week, will support around 68,000 teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students per year to complete their university placements. Recipients will be means tested, and the payments will be delivered by the universities as a type of bursary to students. This was the result of years of advocacy by students and the organisations representing professions that require practical placement to complete their degrees. Income support during university placements was also a recommendation of the Universities Accord, which explicitly recognised the need to reduce the financial hardship and placement poverty caused by mandatory unpaid placements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Department of Health and Aged Care registered nurses require a minimum of 800 hours of unpaid clinical placement. For teachers it's 80 days, and for social workers it's 1,000 hours. As a former nurse, I know that students must complete this practical training before they receive their qualifications. But, especially in a cost-of-living crisis, students should not be expected to work for free. On many occasions, that's exactly what unpaid placements are. Take it from me; I've seen plenty of this. They're working long unpaid hours and they are critical to the whole clinical team. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what should be a necessary course requirement has turned into what is widely known as 'placement poverty'. A 2022 survey by the Council of Heads of Social Work Education, which surveyed more than 700 students, found that the financial burden of placements—often requiring travel, parking and professional clothing or a uniform—could be crippling. There's the cost of undertaking the placement and then the lost income that comes with giving up other paid work in order to undertake these placements. More than a third of students surveyed said they lost their entire weekly income because of placement, with 96 per cent of students saying they didn't have enough money to pay for food, clothes and travel required. The consequences of these challenges aren't just financial. The mental health of many students also suffers with these pressures. These experiences are reflected in the stories of many constituents who contact my office about the significant challenges they face or a family member faces when they're required to find the time to study, work, care for children or other family members and then, on top of this, undertake weeks of unpaid placement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I wrote to the minister on behalf of the constituent who is an enrolled nurse trying to upskill by undertaking training to become a registered nurse. This requires this particular constituent to undertake 20 weeks of unpaid placement, suspending her employment in the process. The constituent noted that if the placement is at a hospital far away from home then they also have to find and pay for their own accommodation, not to mention child care and all the other expenses. For some nurses, this means they must choose between working and completing a degree. As this constituent said, have you ever heard of apprentices not getting paid? I've also heard from a family member of a woman trying to obtain a childcare qualification requiring 60 days of unpaid placement. She highlighted to me the absurdity of a struggling industry that can't attract workers due to abysmal pay getting 60 days of free labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that women are much more likely to have careers in the professions we are talking about—teaching, early childhood education, nursing, social work. According to the latest census, in my electorate, more than 9,000 women are employed by the healthcare and social assistance sector, compared to almost 2,000 men. In education and training, almost 5,000 women are employed, compared to around 1,500 men. And we know only too well about the gender pay gap in this country. Underpaid, overwhelmingly feminised professions, like teaching and nursing, contribute to this. The gender pay gap is exacerbated by the requirement to undertake weeks or months of unpaid placement. We must support women to expand their professional opportunities. The Commonwealth prac payment will provide more financial assistance to help women complete qualifications and therefore improve their income. Truly, this is a step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I strongly support the new prac placements but here's the thing: I don't just want teachers, nurses and social workers to be eligible; the government must consider expanding the payment to allied health students and other important professions that require unpaid placements. I draw attention to allied health because they are an absolutely vital, critical sector of our health workforce, providing crucial services in aged care, the NDIS, schools and our acute hospitals. Unpaid placement hours are a real barrier to training in this profession, and, again, I know—I have worked alongside allied health professionals—we cannot deliver the care that we must without them. As the Chair of the Australian Council of Deans of Health Sciences, Professor Terry Haines, said, placement poverty does not discriminate. For example, occupational health therapy requires 1,000 hours of clinical placement. Dietitians require a minimum of 100 days of placement. Physiotherapy requires 1,000 hours of unpaid placement across 12 months. Medical radiation practitioners require 52 weeks of placement over four years. Again, we can't do without these people. This is why I will move an amendment that will require an independent review on the operation of the new prac payments three years after they commence. This review must consider expanding payments to students undertaking courses that require placements, including allied health courses. I want to see allied health courses included before three years. I absolutely do. But, if this doesn't happen, this amendment will make sure that the government considers including them, and that's really important. This review will also consider whether the new prac payments are effective, whether they are accessible to the teaching, nursing and social work students and working as they should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the bill itself doesn't specify the eligible courses, the means testing method used or even how students will receive the payment. This detail will be laid out in guidelines and regulations determined by the minister. Higher education policy expert Professor Andrew Norton has raised concerns that universities who would administer the payment don't have the resources to run means testing. A mandated review of the payments should consider things like this so we can make any necessary improvements. We want this to work. I want to thank the minister and his office for the productive discussions we have had. I appreciate his understanding of this, and I'd really encourage him to think more broadly about the other professions who need to be included in these payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures included in this bill are important. Progress has been made in acting on the Universities Accord recommendations, but if we are to achieve the 80 per cent tertiary education attainment target by 2050 there's a lot more work to be done. I've already outlined changes that could be made to this bill to ensure it delivers for regional, rural and remote Australia, including changing the date the HECS debts are indexed to come after compulsory repayments are made. Prac payments should be expanded to include degrees in allied health, which are vital to addressing workforce shortages in the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government must also deliver on its commitment to a new needs based funding model that works for regional Australia and that recognises the added cost of delivering tertiary education in regional areas. Regional universities in my electorate are key contributors to the community. They undertake influential research, and they're a driver of regional employment and regional economic development. But the status quo is failing them, their staff and their students, and the government must ensure that they are set up to succeed. It's why I support regional university study hubs, which make it easier for students to succeed while living in regional Australia. I know firsthand what an impact centres in Corryong, Mansfield and Wangaratta have had, and I hope to see a hub finally funded in the Murrindindi shire, where it would make such a difference for students in communities such as Yea, Alexandra and Kinglake, which quite frankly are locked out of further education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I commend the government for its action on some key recommendations of the Universities Accord review, the work is not done. As a regional Independent, I will ensure the education needs of regional, rural and remote Australia are strongly represented in this place and I will continue to push the government to do better. All in all, I'm pleased with the reforms that are here and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  Education changes lives. Like many in this place I am the first person in my family to have gone to university. Unlike some I was not lucky enough to have a free university education—I missed out by a matter of a year or so, I think—but I continue to be grateful that here in Australia we have subsidised universities and that we have what used to be the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and is now called the HELP system. I think if I'd had to pay full fees for university, as they do in some countries overseas, I would not have been able to go to university and I certainly wouldn't have been able to go on and do higher degrees, or like those in overseas countries I would still be crippled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. I was lucky enough to have completed my tertiary education here in Australia and to have a good career and I'm lucky enough to have paid off my HECS debt over time. I often say I should get frequent flyer points at South Australian universities, but I digress!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Boothby I have the main campus of Flinders University and a smaller campus of Adelaide university called the Waite institute, and I have a particularly high number of tertiary students living in the electorate. I hear from them and from their families about the higher HELP debts that they are accruing, the cost of undertaking long, compulsory placements on a full-time basis, how students are having to give up paying jobs to undertake these placements in order to complete their degrees, and how so many of them simply don't complete the degrees because they can't afford to not have paid work. I want something better for those that come after me—for my children's generation and the generations that follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country we want—we need—the next generation to be able to take their place in the workplaces we need: the hospitals, the schools, the advanced manufacturing businesses, human services. We need them to bring their skills and ideas to agriculture, mining and construction, and we want for them to be able to follow the careers that interest them in well-paid, secure jobs. For many of those jobs, tertiary education is the entry point, so we want tertiary education to be an attractive and an affordable option for anyone who so chooses to undertake it, no matter what their background.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is putting in place significant reforms in response to the Australian Universities Accord to provide cost-of-living relief and to make higher education better and fairer for students, including those from low-SES or disadvantaged backgrounds and those from the outer suburbs and regional Australia. The Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 enacts many of the important changes announced in the 2024-25 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making the HECS-HELP system fairer for all Australians and wiping around $3 billion in student debt from three million Australians. Currently the HELP indexation is based on CPI, and last year saw a spike of 7.1 per cent. This meant that the indexing of HECS-HELP debt was higher than wage growth. We don't want to see students and former students going backwards, so we are changing the way the indexation is calculated so that it will be capped at the lower of the consumer price index or wage price index. Not only that, we're backdating this to 1 June 2023, so, for those with a current HECS or HELP debt who saw indexation jump over the past year, this will cut some of that existing indexation. For those who paid off their debt last year, including that higher indexation, the credit will be applied to them as well. For someone with an average HECS debt of around 26½ thousand dollars, this means that their HECS debt will be cut by about $1,200. These changes cover HELP, VET student loans, the Australian apprenticeship support loans and other student loan accounts that existed on 1 June last year. This will benefit around 24,000 people in my electorate of Boothby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area of this bill that is generating the most excitement in my electorate is that, for the first time ever, the Commonwealth will introduce a prac payment to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students to do their mandatory placements. I can't tell you how positive the feedback on this has been. At a street corner meeting last weekend, a current social work student told me she had had to give up her paid work to undertake her prac placement. She was lucky: her husband was working and supported her through this, and her mother was available to look after their two-year-old child. However, I'm sure it wasn't easy for them as a family. Even though she herself would not benefit from paid prac placements, she was so pleased that her fellow students, those following along after her, would not have to do what she had done and give up paid work, because many of them were not in the same situation with family available or able to support them. A lot of students have said that when they do the prac component of their degree, they've got difficult financial decisions to make. Some have to give up their part-time job; others have to move away from home. For a lot of people that can mean delaying finishing their degree or not finishing their degree at all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more teachers, more nurses, more midwives and more social workers. These are some of the important jobs in this country. These are people who are going to teach our kids, who are going to look after us when we're sick or old, who will help women during pregnancy and childbirth and who will support women in domestic violence refuges. Supervised practical placements are an important part of these qualifications to ensure that, when graduates enter the workforce, they are experienced in practice as well as in theory. These jobs have a direct impact on the health, welfare and education outcomes of the people they work on and with. We want these to be attractive courses to study and attractive career options. Reducing these financial barriers of unpaid prac placements will help, and that's why this is important. It's a bit of practical support for people while they do their practical training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked about changes to HECS-HELP calculation and reduction of HECS-HELP debt, and we've talked about the payments for compulsory prac placements for social work students, teaching students, nursing students and midwifery students. But this bill also uncaps fee-free, uni-ready courses right across the country so more people get the skills they need to start a degree. What is a uni-ready course? Many people starting university aren't coming straight from school. They may have left school many years previously; they may not have finished year 12. They may lack confidence about studying. Schooling may not have been a great, successful experience for them. These courses are effectively a bridge between school and university to help people get the skills they need and succeed when they get there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former university lecturer I can tell you that mature-age students are often the most committed and motivated. They know why they're there, they know the value of tertiary education and they've often given up a lot to get back into university. But even students who haven't been out of school for a long time may lack confidence in their ability to study and, particularly, study at a university level where there's an expectation that students will be more self-directed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Uni-ready courses, often called bridging courses, are a great way for potential students to learn about how to study at university and what the expectations are, to practice their skills in a safe environment and to gain the confidence to enrol in a university course. These changes are expected to increase the number of people doing free uni-ready courses by about 40 per cent by the end of the decade and double the number in the decade after that. The flow-on will be more students at university and more well-prepared students at university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also mandates that higher education providers allocate at least 40 per cent of student services and amenities fees to student led organisations. This will strengthen student led organisations and their ability to act for the best interests of students. The bill also includes a definition of 'student led organisations' and allows for transition arrangements to support higher education providers and the student led organisations to put in place appropriate arrangements. Of course, relevant to my home state of South Australia, this bill also adds Adelaide University to the list of table A providers, reflecting the merger of the University of South Australia and the University of Adelaide, which is currently being undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to end where I began: education changes lives. It changes careers. It changes families. It changes communities. This groundbreaking bill is only one part of the Universities Accord, but it is a really important part because this bill is about making education more affordable for all. The reduction in financial barriers for students will particularly encourage people from lower SES communities and regional areas, women, mature-age students and those who disproportionately experience barriers to tertiary education to consider a tertiary course and a tertiary qualified career. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  The final report of the taskforce charged with coming up with the Universities Accord put it bluntly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia must significantly increase participation in tertiary education. This is a matter of urgency. Australia is not meeting its current skills needs and will not meet them in the future unless we produce more higher education and VET graduates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Failure to increase student numbers to meet these needs will do lasting damage to Australia's prospects of national economic success. It will also do lasting damage to social cohesion by preventing generations of Australians from enjoying the career opportunities and higher incomes that tertiary education makes possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a surprise. Businesses and economists were warning about skills shortages years ago. COVID exacerbated the problem, and now we find ourselves without the skilled workers we need, whether it be workers to supercharge the transition to clean, green and cheaper energy or the skilled workforce to build and service the AUKUS submarines, should they ever see the light of day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make up for lost time, the report listed four ambitious targets: lifting the tertiary attainment rate, university as well as vocational education and training, from 60 per cent currently to at least 80 per cent by 2050; increasing the proportion of university educated Australians aged 25 to 34 from 45 per cent currently to 55 per cent by 2050, requiring a doubling of the number of Commonwealth supported students in universities from 860,000 currently to 1.8 million by 2050; planning for 40 per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds to have a tertiary-level vocational or technical qualification in 2050; and providing opportunities for lifelong learning for all Australians to reskill and upskill. None of these targets is out of the question, but they are quite a challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When HECS was introduced in 1989, less than eight per cent of the population had a degree. By 2023, it had risen to 21 per cent. That is quite a climb, but it is also a reminder of the task ahead of us if we are to get to 80 per cent by mid-century, especially when young people are under pressure in ways that most of us were not at their age. Forty-five per cent of Goldstein residents have a degree, which is close to double the national average. Nearly 20 per cent are currently studying at university, which is nearly five per cent more than elsewhere. But these students are living with greater instability, insecurity and uncertainty than earlier generations. Employment is much less secure than it was in the past, and there is no certainty anymore that a university degree will reward a graduate with higher income than someone without tertiary qualifications. On top of all that, they are living amid a once-in-a-generation cost-of-living crisis. Rents have reached a record high, with the median weekly rent in Australia now at $659 a week—9.4 per cent higher than a year ago. The days when it was relatively easy to find an affordable share house are over, as are the days when students could be sure their pay in part-time jobs would keep pace with inflation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many young students in my electorate are still living at home with their parents because they simply can't afford to move out. That because, in real terms, although recently wages have finally grown slightly, the average wage is the same now in real terms as it was in 2011. Meanwhile, the escalation in tuition fees means that graduates have much higher HECS debts in real terms than even a decade ago, and much more than when the system was introduced. When HECS came into being, the idea was that all university degrees would cost the same amount—$1,800 a year, the equivalent of around $4,700 today—significant, but not insurmountable. It's not the same story now. Tax office data compiled by the Australia Institute shows that Australians in their 20s with a HECS-HELP debt in 2005-06 had an average debt of $12,557. From then until June 2023, inflation increased by 57 per cent. Had the average size of debt increased in line with inflation, the average 2022-23 HECS-HELP debt held by people in their 20s should have been $19,546. Instead, according to the Australia Institute, the average debt had risen by 145 per cent and was $30,763. That doesn't even consider the previous government's ineffective and punitive Jobs Ready Program, which saw the cost of a communications degree, for example, rise from around $20,400 to $43,500.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was early in 2023, before that year's federal budget, that it became clear to me that the high rate of inflation was creating hardship for some HECS-HELP debtors, whose debts were increasing faster than repayments. At the same time, real wages had been falling, creating a perverse outcome—as the universities accord report noted—where HELP debts were growing just as relative ability to service debts was declining. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the education minister about recognising the difficulties that high inflation was creating for students and recent graduates by reforming the indexation formula for HECS-HELP debts. I suggested that the formula should be determined based on whatever was lower—the consumer price index or the wage price index—as happens in some places overseas. Although it took a year, to his credit, the minister added this to the work program for the Australian Universities Accord review, which accepted and recommended the change in this year's budget, helped along by a massive petition launched by the member for Kooyong. The result is this legislation, which, by backdating the change to last year, when HECS indexation was pegged to an inflation figure of 7.1 per cent, is wiping out around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. Those with an average debt will see their liability cut by $1,200.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I truly appreciate the efforts of the minister and his staff, and that he has listened to the crossbench on this matter, but the job in relation to HECS-HELP is only partly done. The government has yet to give effect to two other elements of its recommendation for HECS-HELP reform. They are: to reduce repayment times by changing the timing of indexation for HELP loans so that amounts withheld for compulsory repayments can be accounted for before indexation is applied; and reviewing bank lending practices to ensure that banks recognise that HELP loans are not like other types of loans and are not treated in a way that unduly limits people's borrowing capacity for home loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1980s, when HECS came in, the average house cost about 3½ times the average salary, according to esteemed finance journalist and my former ABC colleague Alan Kohler. Today it's more than doubled to 7½ times the average income, and that means that every single dollar that can be scraped together for a deposit matters deeply to a first home buyer. Unfortunately, for new graduates who have started a family, their HECS-HELP debt definitely does not help, because banks penalise people for the amount of HECS owing, adding it to what's owed in genuine debt on a car loan or credit card, for instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister promised to talk to the banks about this inequity and told reporters, as he announced the HECS indexation change:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Assistant Treasurer has written to the banks. He's written to the ABA seeking more information on the way in which banks treat HECS debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have yet to hear about any outcome from the Assistant Treasurer's inquiries. I'm sure that the House would appreciate knowing the result of any discussions and whether lending institutions are prepared to regard HECS debt differently from other debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students and other stakeholders also approached me about another inequity in the system, one relating to the timing of when the annual rate of indexation would be imposed. As the accord review notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Though this timing (which is late in the financial year) assists with the administration of the HELP system, amounts withheld during the year are not applied to reduce HELP debts until the following June. In some circumstances, HELP debts may have been 'acquitted' if not for the application of indexation prior to repayments being recognised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that the way that compulsory repayments and indexation are set up means that the extra tax withheld for HECS-HELP repayments on individuals' salaries does not actually apply until they submit their tax return after indexation has been applied. In just one example, modelled by the Parliamentary Library and based on a graduate who completed their studies in 2010 with a debt of $15,292—the cost then of an average degree—the difference is small but significant. The final payment, if indexed first, would be $679, but it would be just $298 if repayments were made ahead of indexation—a saving of $381 to the graduate. Obviously, the bigger the debt, the bigger the saving. The accord review recommends:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the timing of HELP debt indexation be changed to allow the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to ensure that amounts withheld from debtors' income during the financial year can be applied as a compulsory repayment before indexation occurs …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change must be made, and I urge the minister to finish the job and get it done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of the most severe inflation crisis the Australian economy has faced this century, our laws guiding accessibility to tertiary education must serve our students, not saddle them with more and more debt. We know, and so does the government, that the calculation of a student's HELP loan prior to the processing of their end of financial year tax return amounts to a double-dipping of debt repayments. This results in many Australian students often paying more than they otherwise would have, more than their fair share, if calculation occurred later in the year. We also know—and the government does too—that HELP debt is often yet another barrier for graduates and young Australian families seeking a loan or mortgage. Banks and financial institutions consider existing HELP debt as they assess an individual's eligibility. This practice must end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these two reasons and to alleviate the financial burden on Australian students who choose to pursue tertiary education, I move the second reading amendment as circulated in my name:</span>

                    <a href="101351" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  Education is at the heart of Australia's success. It's part of the story of success in this country. In my electorate of Wills in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, we have so many staff and students in the university sector. I speak with them regularly and often hear them identify many issues around access, equality and affordability within our higher education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that there is a very impactful cost-of-living challenge that we are facing in our economy right now. Everyone is seeing and feeling this. That's why the Albanese Labor government understands the immense pressures that have built up in our higher education system, and that's why the government is putting in place significant reforms to provide cost-of-living relief for students and has a long-term focus on delivering a better and fairer university sector for students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, of course, have always valued the immense importance of a good-quality education. As you'd know, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, as a migrant to this country—my parents escaped a region where there was war and persecution—having that amazing opportunity to get a good education was so special and so important for us. It allowed me to be standing here today, because access to quality education is really the key that unlocks opportunity. It unlocks the opportunity and unlocks the potential that we can fulfil. We can make a contribution if we're able to fulfil our potential through a sense of purpose as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Minister for Education for introducing the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 in response to the Universities Accord. The government has consulted widely and ensured that the views of key stakeholders have been heard on this legislation. The Universities Accord was headed by eminent Australian industry expert Professor Mary O'Kane. Her final report set the blueprint for how higher education could be reformed to deliver a higher education system that could be the envy of the world. A key aspect of that is the affordability of university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will allow students who go on practical placements as part of their degree to finally be paid for the work that they do. I cannot stress enough how important that cost-of-living relief will be to the hundreds of students in my electorate who will get money back in their pockets as a result of this policy. We know for a fact that young women, in particular, are more likely to study degrees with practical placements and receive no wage or payment for the work that is essential to completing their course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can relate to the story of a young woman in my electorate who is studying to become a social worker. Aaliyah completed several units of practical work which had to be completed in order to receive her qualification. I spoke to her about her work, and she said that juggling these shifts along with study and trying to pay for the groceries was a real struggle; it was really difficult. There are many stories like this that I'm sure we hear about all too frequently. But it's fantastic to be able to say that the Albanese Labor government is responding to this issue so that women like Aaliyah will not have to cut back on essentials like groceries just so they can realise their dream of completing their studies, and why should they?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education opens the door to opportunity, as I said. It has unlocked the potential for millions of Australians, regardless of their background. Whether they are from regions or the city, whether they're socioeconomically disadvantaged, whether they're Indigenous Australians, whether they're from migrant families or whether they're from different faith backgrounds, education has been the ticket to a better future. It is that great leveller of society. Many of us in this place have been fortunate, through the facilitation of these policies, to be given the opportunity to get a great education and fulfil our potential. That's why this bill is important. In providing long-term relief to students through the facilitation of a weekly Commonwealth prac payment, it will protect the place of education as a great leveller—not the thing that pushes people into financial hardship, for instance, but the thing that takes people out of that and gives them the confidence to be able to move forward. Per year, this will support approximately 68,000 teaching; nursing, including midwifery; and social work students to complete their university placements. That's not only good for students; it provides cost-of-living relief and is an investment in the future of Australia, ensuring that no-one is shut off from realising their potential and that no-one is left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there's more work to do. In May, the RMIT Association of Pharmacy Students and the Victorian Pharmacy Students Association contacted me on behalf of all pharmacy students in my electorate, asking for the government to extend prac payments to them. I received that request and I obviously listened to their representations. On that issue of prac payments for those particular areas, there is a start in this bill. Importantly, we're listening to the different stakeholders in the community and taking a number of measures that will help every student, not just some students. This includes the really important amelioration of the big hike in HECS-HELP debt last year. Indexed to inflation, it meant that HECS-HELP debts across the country would have increased by 7.1 per cent at their peak. This is why the Albanese Labor government is, with this legislation, wiping $3 billion in student debt for three million Australians. That's hugely significant and that's a direct action to particularly help younger Australians in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of young people who work in my electorate whilst balancing study, whether at the reception of the Glenroy family clinic or at the Hadfield Woolies. The government hears you. We're listening to you and we're acting on this. We know that you want to complete your studies without being financially burdened, and that's why this has been so important. In addition, we know that the cost of living has put a real squeeze on young people having to make choices between studying and getting more work. With inflation at 7.1 per cent and the HECS payments indexed to this inflation, those young people with debts of $50,000 would have been slapped with an additional $3,550 in indexation costs. That's no longer the case. That's real relief for those students and that has been very warmly welcomed by students right across my electorate and the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite a lot of people in the community pressuring young people and saying, 'Don't eat the avocado toast or the kale. If you save on that you'll be able to save up,' that's not going to work. Pulling back on a couple of breakfasts or coffees or lattes—no amount of saving on these types of things is going to relieve the real intergenerational unfairness that younger Australians are facing in the current economic environment, especially with the debt that they're facing. This debt relief is real. It's practical and substantial. Under a Labor government, we've delivered it and it's here to stay, because HECS loans will now be indexed to the CPI or the wage price index, whichever is lower. If your wages aren't growing, your debt shouldn't be, either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this bill couples immediate cost-of-living relief with a long-term plan to ensure accessibility to quality higher education. The government wants to do more than just remove the barriers to education. We want to actively encourage skills and training. That's why the government set a target of 80 per cent of the workforce having a tertiary qualification by 2050. That's the next step, and it's similar to what Labor has always done to deliver world-class results, starting with the Hawke-Keating reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember speaking to the late, great Bob Hawke, one of the great prime ministers if not the greatest Prime Minister this country has seen. Some on the other side might dispute that, but he was a great prime minister. I remember asking Bob—it was over a couple of beers—after he had regaled me with all of these stories about his government's achievements during those periods, 'What's something that you achieved that not many people talk about?' He was telling me all about how he helped end the Cold War by negotiating between Reagan and Thatcher and Gorbachev—he was sort of in the middle of that—and about all of the big economic reforms that he did. I'm not going to do an impersonation of Bob, but he said: 'When I started as Prime Minister, some 30 per cent of students were matriculating'—that's what they used to call finishing high school. 'By the end of my time as Prime Minister, some 80 per cent of people were finishing high school.' I said, 'Bob, I was one of those,' because I did year 12 in 1990, while he was still Prime Minister. So we've all benefited from the policies of the Hawke government, and later on the Keating government, to boost this access to education and to good education, and the Albanese government is continuing this tradition. It's in our DNA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also takes an important step in ensuring that students at universities have a greater say in how their student fees are used. The legislation will support students by requiring that higher education providers allocate a minimum of 40 per cent of their student services and amenities fees revenue to student led organisations, ensuring students have a greater voice in how their services and amenities fees are spent. That's a significant addition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to recognise that this legislation is just one part of the Albanese government's comprehensive reform agenda on education. Whether it's providing fee-free TAFE places for 500,000 students to give them the skills and the training they need for the jobs of the future, expanding access to scholarships for Indigenous students and students from low socio-economic backgrounds, or delivering the largest increase in federal funding to public schools since Federation, the Albanese government is delivering the necessary reforms to deliver a world-class education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, young people will be able to pursue their studies without being crushed by debt. If you are a child of migrants like I am and you are, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, we—and I think people who have come from the regions or from socio-economic grounds that are somewhat disadvantaged—know what it's like to have your parents say: 'No matter what you do, get a good education. Please focus on your studies. Get it done, because we don't want you not being able to fulfil your potential.' Not everyone is going to go to medical school in that context. When your parents say to you, 'Get a good education, get the skills and get the training you need to get a good life and a purposeful life,' it doesn't mean that everyone is going study law or medicine and become a lawyer or a doctor, but it's important that they have the opportunity to study, to go to TAFE or to university, or to get whatever skills or training are required to give them that opportunity. So, whether you choose to go to TAFE or to get a degree or two, you shouldn't face any barriers because of where you come from, what your background is or what your socio-economic circumstances are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education spoke about being the first member of his family to go to university, to go on to higher education. There are a lot of people in my electorate that share that experience. Labor understands that investment in education is an investment in people and an investment in this country's future. When we invest in education it's a statement of what we want this country's future to be. We want to give people this opportunity. We want to give people the key that unlocks the door to opportunity, that allows them to step in and fulfil their potential in whatever they wish to do and that makes their life one of purpose and meaning through that. That's what education does. We don't want a future where education is for an exclusive few and where people are shut out from learning. We want a future in which we deliver that opportunity for any Australian that wants to take that step. We want a future where education is an open door to the success that makes us who we are, where dedication and hard work are rewarded, where education is the foundation for realising a better future for those individuals, their families, their communities and the society more broadly, where no Australians are held back because of where they come from or what their background is, and where no-one is left behind.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  There are a number of topics that we get to debate in this chamber in a particular parliamentary term, but I think it's really important that we take a stand on the sort of nation that we want to be. Today, I've actually had three primary schools come through the House, so to have an opportunity to stand and talk to the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill tonight, for me, is particularly timely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, I think the question we need to ask ourselves as a nation is do we see the education of young people and others across the country as an investment in the future of our economy on the basis that those that are educated and upskilled are able to generate significant personal income that then translates into significant personal income tax takings, or do we want to continue in a mindset where the investment is only warranted where it is into high-return professions, or is the case where those who can afford to learn are given the opportunity to learn while those who cannot afford are left on the sidelines? Like many in this chamber, I am the first person in my family to go to university, and it was drummed into me from a very young age that education was the way out and up. It's a message that I have passed onto my children, but it's not lost on me, as somebody in this House, that, actually, I am the first generation of HECS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I entered university, it was the first time that HECS and a user-pay system was introduced. I can't help but reflect on the fact that the first generation exposed to that regime have actually gone on to continue to thrive. We were asked to abide by a set of rules that enabled us to have a sense of paying back our education, but it didn't hold us back from achieving everything else we wanted to do, including owning homes and setting up businesses. Somewhere along the line, in the pursuit of an ideal that was established back in 1989, we have lost our way as a nation, and we are uncertain about what tertiary education now means to us and why we wish to invest in it or how we wish to invest in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'd like to do tonight is take a moment to say I encourage all of us in this parliament to reset our expectations around education and to be prepared to fight for education as a fundamental human right—a right that all should have access to. For us to enable that, though, we are going to need bipartisan support in this place, and so I do reach out to colleagues right across this chamber to say please weigh up in your mind what you role you think education plays in driving our economy and our society forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it relates to this particular piece of legislation, the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024 implements some of the recommendations of the Australian Universities Accord final report, which was tabled in 2023, and it takes the necessary and long overdue steps to start to improve our higher education sector. It's true: the community of North Sydney welcomes this legislation, particularly the changes to the method by which HELP debt indexation is calculated each year, as this is an issue my community specifically raised with the government within the first six months of my term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing the way the indexation is calculated ensures the perverse indexation outcomes of 2023 are not repeated and that HELP debts will no longer grow faster than wages. I sincerely thank the minister and his team for their engagement on this issue. Many in my electorate have written to me about HELP debt indexation over the last two years, including current school students worried about their ability to afford tertiary education, recent entrants to the workforce who were shocked to find their HELP debt growing despite their repayments and parents who see their adult children struggling to launch themselves into the world under the weight of HELP debt. In an environment where the cost-of-living crisis is being felt by everyone, burgeoning HELP debts reduce young people's capacity for economic engagement and disincentivise the personal investment in education that we, as a society, are looking to encourage. Indeed, the various targets outlined in the final accord report, such as lifting tertiary education attainment rates to 80 per cent by 2050, are incredibly ambitious. I think we need to be clear: that will not be achieved without making the system more equitable, more affordable, more accessible, more inspirational and, ultimately, more aspirational, particularly for people from disadvantaged or remote backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the truth of the reform that we see in this legislation is that it's only part of the story, and there is still definitely more for this government and this parliament to do. For this reason I welcome the opportunity to support the member for Goldstein's second reading amendment, which appropriately draws the House's attention to one fact that I think is often overlooked. That is that the costs of many degrees have increased well above CPI in recent years, resulting in punitive HELP debts which are placing additional financial burden on Australians in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member's amendment also calls on the government to calculate HELP debt indexation after the due date for individual tax returns each year, and on this my community could not agree more. While changing the rate of debt indexation will make a difference and is very welcome, the truth is that my community believes the government should consider whether the equity ambitions underlying this legislation could be furthered by changing the date of HELP debt indexation to allow indexation to be applied to the truly reduced balances—one that takes into account the payments that have been withheld against a debt in any given year. Alongside addressing the rate of debt indexation, changing the date of indexation was a recommendation in the final accord report and is something I have previously written to the minister about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an ideal world I think we could agree: debt repayments would be applied in real time in the same way that they are when you pay off any other debt, be that your credit card or a mortgage. Sadly, however, the ATO have previously stated that this is impossible because their systems can't cope with it. The ATO's systems can't cope with what should be a fundamental truth. My community would strongly advocate that the ATO's systems be fixed, that if we've identified this challenge then we should step in to it and address it, and that indexation should be changed from the current date of 1 June to 1 November each year as a pragmatic middle ground that goes some way to addressing the current inequity. A date of 1 November would allow time for those with a HELP debt to complete a tax return and have the indexation applied to the reduced debt. While it's not perfect, this would at least reduce the extent to which withheld payments are accrued without benefit whilst incentivising those with a HELP debt to complete a tax return before 1 November. Surely, that's a win-win.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community is also pleased to see that the legislation seeks to address the financial hardship that comes with students completing mandatory practical study, including in critical areas like teaching, nursing and social work. Placement poverty is absolutely an issue that is being experienced by people living in my electorate, and it has been raised with me time and again by both students and parents as they struggle to afford to support themselves or their child through extensive periods of mandatory placement, which often take place in locations far from home and necessitate forgoing individual income-earning opportunities. Indeed, according to the government, some 68,000 students studying teaching, nursing or social work and 5,000 eligible VET students will benefit from this Commonwealth prac payment. Conceptually this is a welcome initiative, but the detail on what percentage of existing enrolments it will cover and what increases this might encourage is conspicuously missing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also quite inconsistent with other employment law in other places. As somebody who has run businesses, I remember, with clarity, when it became illegal for me to bring an intern into my business without paying them, whether that was in a communications role or in a marketing role, and I do not understand why that law has not been equally applied across all workplaces. We are essentially putting these students out as free labour in specific areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, the payment the government is pursuing is only proposed to be a maximum of $319.50 a week, which is significantly less than comparable payments, including Austudy. With eligibility rules that require students either to be on some form of Australian government income support or to be able to demonstrate that they needed to work more than 15 hours per week prior to their placement to attend uni, this modest compensation of $8 an hour will be hard to access and probably won't cover what's being lost. It is, of course, better than nothing, but I question whether the payment will actually shift the dial on student decision-making. It will certainly not be enough to cover the cost of city based students undertaking their prac placements in rural communities or, reciprocally, to enable students located in remote areas to experience a placement in the city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, I witnessed this firsthand recently, when a daughter of one of my friends took a social work placement in Orange. Far from home and with no time for another job, my friend's daughter relied on her limited savings and her family to cover her rent and basic living expenses for just on four months, and I saw the pressure it placed on everyone. It's not that anyone begrudged her the opportunity, and everyone was ecstatic that she was headed to a regional community, but the challenge was real. While this legislation provides a good headline, I can't see how it is going to help a young person like my friend's daughter, and, to me, it's a missed opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also many other important studies requiring significant student commitment to unpaid placements that are not covered by this proposal, including medicine, vet science, allied health and psychology. Given that we are in the middle of a mental health crisis, I wonder at the exclusion of what I think we can all agree is a critical and in-demand profession. With mental health in mind, I'm conflicted about accepting that this payment must be targeted using economic imperatives, rather than being driven by student welfare—although I understand there is only so much money to go around. If we are truly to encourage young people to undertake degrees, however, and stem shortages in professions identified as key enablers in our economy, we need to do better than $8 an hour, and I implore the minister and this government to open these payments to other courses as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill mandates that 40 per cent of student services and amenities fees, or SSAF, revenue is to be distributed to student-led organisations. From what I can tell, most organisations are comfortable with this, as are the universities. However, it is imperative that the organisations have a demonstrated capacity to manage the funds. I note that some universities—including the Australian Catholic University, which has a campus in my electorate of North Sydney—currently actually provide student services directly, and, in the ACU's case, there is no student union arrangement. This poses obvious challenges insofar as the ACU has dedicated, trained, permanent staff providing student services and support and no immediately qualified student leadership groups to which the SSAF funds could be redirected. The ability, therefore, to seek transitional relief from this mandate is both sensible and welcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I believe my community will welcome this as a good piece of legislation, one which could be made better by the adoption of the amendments moved by the member for Goldstein and others on the crossbench. For this reason, I commend the amendments to the government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  This bill, the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024, implements the first stage of the Australian Universities Accord, focusing on measures which will have an immediate impact on students in higher education, including changes to HECS indexation, the introduction of the Commonwealth prac payment, the introduction of fee-free uni-ready courses, and changes to student services and amenities fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I was elected in 2019, I have engaged thoroughly with our university sector here in Canberra. My electorate is home to the most universities of any electorate in the country. The Australian National University, the University of Canberra, the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy, the Australian Catholic University and Charles Sturt University all have campuses here in the Canberra electorate. We're also looking forward to UNSW opening their Reid campus in the next few years. What they're planning looks amazing, and there are already a lot of great things happening there. It is safe to say that Canberra is a university town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 53 per cent of Canberrans in my electorate hold a university degree, which is around double the national average, and 43 per cent of Canberrans are currently either studying at a university or in vocational education. Higher education is the third biggest employer in the electorate, following the government sector and defence. It's clear that reform to the sector is important for my constituents, and I'm very proud to be part of a government that's committed to making our universities stronger for their students, for their staff and for the research they produce, which makes our nation and world stronger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, with this bill, we progress some of those core reforms recommended in the Universities Accord. The Universities Accord provided us with a blueprint to reform higher education over the next several decades. It's a long-term plan to make the sector even stronger. Funding and implementing it will take more than one single budget cycle. This bill is the first phase of the implementation of the recommendations. A key part of this is reforming the Higher Education Loan Program, which used to be known as HECS—and I note that, although much better, the acronym 'HELP' has never seemed to have caught on so much as 'HECS'. The changes mean that the indexation of HELP debts will be based on either the consumer price index or the wage price index, whichever is lower. This change applies to HELP loans, VET loans, Australian apprenticeship support loans and other student support loans. We've listened to people who are paying off their student loans, and we've acted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, with CPI as high as it was, millions of Australians saw a significant increase in their student debts at tax time. For many, the indexation essentially added back onto their debts the payments that they had made on every payday over the year. Some saw indexation push their debts even higher than that, and many wondered if they would ever be able to pay off these debts. The changes to indexation will be backdated to loans that existed on 1 June last year. In essence, what that means is that the indexation that occurred based on the CPI rate of 7.1 per cent will be replaced with the lower wage price index of 3.2 per cent. For this year's indexation, instead of the 4.7 per cent it would have been, it will now be four per cent. This will wipe about $3 billion worth of student debt for three million Australians across the country. For someone with an average debt of $26,500, they will see around $1,200 taken off. For someone with a debt of $45,000, their debt will be lowered by $2,000, and, for someone owing $60,000, their debt will be reduced by $2,700. This is what happens when you have a government that listens and better decisions are made. We've taken this action to support students and people with student debts because it is undoubtedly the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also establishes the Commonwealth prac payment. It was wonderful to join the Minister for Education at the University of Canberra Hospital recently to talk to nursing students about the huge difference it will make to them. For students studying nursing, midwifery, teaching or social work, the Commonwealth will support them as they undertake their previously unpaid prac placements. The accord recommended that these are the courses we focus on first, and that's what we're doing. I know I've heard from others in my community wishing to include other courses, and this is a starting point for this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a huge barrier in accessing higher education for many is the costs, and, for particular courses, hard decisions need to be made. When students are undertaking prac placements, they're essentially undertaking full-time work, and many will need to move away from home to undertake the prac in a different location. They need to decide whether to give up their part-time jobs. They may even need to rent in two places at once. For too many students, these decisions will mean either they have to delay their degrees or they don't finish them at all—or they don't start them at all. This payment will support them through their degrees so that our future nurses, teachers, social workers and midwives are able to graduate and enter the workforce, filling those critical skills shortages in some of the most important professions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be practical support while people are doing their practical training. As we heard from the students at the University of Canberra Hospital, this will mean a lot to them and will make it much easier for them to be able to undertake these practical placements, particularly when they are unable to do any paid work while they are doing them. We also heard about people who had not been able to enrol in those courses at all because of the inability to cover those times without an income and that this will make a big difference to those people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give an example of what this will mean, a mature-age midwifery student from the University of Technology Sydney, who is a mother of two small children, told the Minister for Education that this reform will be life-changing for her and that it will help her better balance her studies, her practical work placement and looking after her children. She said that it will also benefit future mature age students who might want to enrol in courses but who previously couldn't afford to. That's what this reform is all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also uncapping fee-free uni-ready courses right across the country so that more Australians can get the skills they need to start their degrees. These courses, often known as bridging courses, help people to succeed when they finally start their tertiary studies. The changes we're making to these courses are expected to increase the number of people completing these free bridging courses by about 40 per cent by the end of the decade and double that number in the decade following that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jennifer Barker from Newcastle is a prime example of how these courses can change lives. As a young mum at 19, Jennifer had worked long term in hospitality and didn't have the opportunity to undertake university study. She saw an ad in her local paper for one of these fee-free courses. She went and enrolled and she now has a science degree, an honours degree, a PhD and was the recipient of a Fulbright scholarship. Today she works as a computational medicinal chemist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to ensure that higher education is available to everyone who wants it and that every person in Australia is able to pursue those dreams and is not held back by the relatively minimal costs which can be such a barrier to people undertaking a bridging course or something like that. We don't want people's chances in life to be decided by their bank account or their parents' bank account or their postcode. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also mandates that higher education providers allocate at least 40 per cent of the student services and amenities fees to student led organisations. This will strengthen student led organisations in their ability to act in the best interests of students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are a major part of our economy. They educate our citizens, conduct groundbreaking research, drive innovation and employ many thousands of workers. Unfortunately, however, our university sector is not currently fit for purpose and requires serious reform. Fortunately, we've got a government and a minister that are up to the task.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How refreshing it is to be standing here talking about reforms we wish to make to the university sector, rather than having to defend the sector from attacks from those opposite. For a decade we saw ideologically motivated attack after attack on our universities, often because they told the government inconvenient truths. We saw the previous occupiers of the education minister's office wage war on the humanities. They picked and chose the disciplines that would be so lucky—not to receive extra funding but to not have their funding levels cut. We do things differently on this side of the House, and this bill is one example of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's education system is already world-class, but it could do a lot better and it could be a lot fairer. The reforms in this bill are just the beginning. We've got an ambitious agenda for higher education, and work is already underway. Some of the big recommendations we're implementing include removing the 50 per cent pass rule that was part of the Morrison government's Job-ready Graduates Package, expanding demand-driven funding to all First Nations students who are eligible for the course they apply for, expanding the number of regional university study hubs across the country and setting them up in the outer suburbs, extending the Higher Education Continuity Guarantee for a further two years to provide funding certainty to universities as the accord process rolls out, and working with state and territory governments to improve university governance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago we announced a review of the Australian Research Council, the first in more than 20 years. We're implementing all of the recommendations of that review, including the most important one: the establishment of an independent ARC board responsible for the approval of grants instead of the minister. This is getting the politics out of ARC grant funding, where it shouldn't play any role. Since then, both of those reports have been turned into legislation, have been passed by the parliament and are now law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also acting on the appalling rates of sexual violence on campuses around the nation. Shockingly, one in 20 students have been sexually assaulted since they started their university studies, one in six have been sexually harassed, and 50 per cent of those feel their voices are not listened to. We've agreed with the states and territories to establish a national student ombudsman. The ombudsman would be an independent body to investigate and resolve disputes, giving students a stronger voice. I acknowledge the really important and groundbreaking work of some students right here in Canberra at organisations such as End Rape on Campus and the STOP Campaign, who put in incredible work to protect students from sexual violence. You spoke up when your institutions failed you, and the government has listened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has always been the party of education and higher education. When Bob Hawke came to government, the number of Australians finishing school stood at 40 per cent. At the end of the Keating government, that number had increased to 80 per cent. The Universities Accord has set us a target such that, by 2050, 80 per cent of our workforce should be not just finishing school but also going on to study at TAFE or university. It's an ambitious goal, but it's one that we are fully committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, his staff and the hardworking public servants at the Department of Education for their work putting this bill together and for the broader reforms already enacted and yet to come. Education is so critically important to the health of our nation, and that's why this bill is so important.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  We know intergenerational inequality is growing, and growing rapidly, and the cost of university degrees and the HECS or HELP debt, as it's known today, plays a major part in that generational inequality. My parents' generation had free university. My generation had a system that did not burden us with too much debt. What I am seeing now, with my children and their friends and so many of the younger generation, is that they are burdened by, I would say, nearly unconscionable debt when it comes to how they are going to face their prospects. This will impact young people's ability to get ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know some 2.9 million Australians have some form of HELP debt, and it takes them close to 10 years to repay it in full, if they are so lucky as to be able to. The current HELP system impacts a number of young people attending university to become our future workforce, impacting on how they choose their subjects and what they are looking at. It also impacts older Australians that are returning to university to retrain or gain further qualifications. We need more people to be considering this. We know current younger generations will have up to 10 different jobs in their work lives—it's changing dramatically—and that will mean retraining. We can't have a situation where, to meet our skills demand—which we want people to do, especially older Australians, where they are in a dying industry or there are new opportunities that require retraining—we are burdening people with so much debt that there's a disincentive to go forward. We know that all too often it's older women in that category of retraining or gaining further qualifications, and that really impacts them and creates a really big inequity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am strongly urging the government—and I support this bill—to do all it can to ensure younger generations and those looking to retrain and upskill can do so confidently without being burdened by an unreasonable amount of debt. We know so much of our economic future as a nation relies on people being able to retrain so we can fill all the areas where we have significant skills shortages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a start, but let's get real—much more needs to be done. That includes further reform when it comes to how and when the indexation of HELP loans occurs. It's just unacceptable that the ATO can withhold a HELP loan repayment from someone's salary or pay on a monthly basis during the year but that that amount is not applied to their HELP debt in real time. Essentially, indexation is applied to HELP loans by the ATO on 1 June each year, but the ATO does not process the loan repayments that it has withheld, that a person has not had the benefit of, until after personal tax returns are processed. So you have this inequity whereby, despite the payments being withheld from someone's pay, they're not applied to reduce the debt, which is ultimately indexed and grows.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst it is a welcome change in this legislation, this system does not make sense—that the timing and how indexation occurs continue to be as they currently are. The government should legislate to either allow for repayments in real time or move the day of indexation from 1 June to later in the calendar year, to reduce the burden on those paying back their debt and stop the double dipping effect, in essence, that it has on people with their HELP loans. It is certainly not a system we see in any other area that the ATO engages in, and it's quite nonsensical that it remains in this case. The government, I know, is well aware of this, and I thank the minister for our discussions around this, but I think we need to hurry up with the change. This really is a burden on top of so many younger people and people that are looking to further their skills, to retrain and do further study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do acknowledge that this bill represents progress, especially progress when it comes to the huge mobilisation of young people in our communities who called on the government to do this. In fact, we first met with the minister back on 1 June 2023 to raise the issue. At the time, we had the situation of 7.1 per cent of indexation, meaning debts were growing at a rate that was incredibly alarming for so many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do? The HELP debt indexation rate will now be linked to either the consumer price index or the wage price index, whichever is lower. That is welcome. That will create a significant reduction. It is also really good to see the establishment of the Commonwealth prac payment. This payment will support students undertaking mandatory workplace placements required for university and vocational education qualifications. It's good progress. We know having to attend that vocational placement is often prescriptive and simply unaffordable for many, so I know that goes some way to alleviating the placement poverty that many have faced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it is still picking winners; we are covering only some placements, not all mandatory placements for certain qualifications. I've raised that with the minister, and the answer was simple—that ultimately it's a budgeting question. At the moment, it's a question of picking priorities. I would argue that this is an important aspect. If we're going to fill skills shortages, we need to make sure any qualification that requires a vocational placement has access to the prac payment. So the bill is a good start, but more needs to be done to reform the student debt system and to support those already in study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that a lot of the work and the progress of this bill are a result of the final report of the Universities Accord, and that important work was led by Professor Mary O'Kane AC, with some expert support from a range of individuals with expertise in higher education. It's important to note the final aspects in that report—that higher education is integral to Australia's future and that 'the knowledge, skills and research it produces enable us to be an economically prosperous, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable nation'. If we do not invest in our future in training and qualifications, we simply will not be at the table of the future economy of a net zero world. And we will really be selling our future generations short if we don't take care of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is already a lot of pressure on many sectors in relation to skills shortages. We need more teachers for early childhood through to secondary schools. We need more doctors and nurses, more engineers and more skilled trade people. It is particularly key as we look to the transition to the net zero economy. In the next five years, 90 per cent of new jobs will demand tertiary education, yet we're seeing a decrease in completion of bachelor degrees, and a worsening skilled worker shortage looms. For example, for AUKUS, we know there is going to be a significant demand for engineers and there's a requirement that they be Australian-born or Australian-citizen engineers. We don't qualify anywhere near the necessary number of engineers through our university system to meet that demand. That's just AUKUS, let alone the requirement we know we will have around the transition to clean energy and the transition that so many of our industries need to do. That's just one other area where we don't talk about it enough, but this is a major problem to many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the cost-of-living crisis and the spike in inflation haven't helped this sector and this debt. They've put many under pressure, and I know, for example, that many businesses in Warringah are also deeply affected by skill shortages. It's where we need to look for innovation and for ways to get efficiencies and to support so many more of our industries. For the government to meet Australia's needs and create the future we want for our society, our education system needs to be equitable, especially for marginalised groups. So I do wholeheartedly support the bill. It shifts the dial ever so slightly on the issue of fairness and an equitable future. I want to thank the many who raised their voice on this issue because it's a real power of democracy to put pressure on government to move on an issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's also important from a gender equality point of view. We know that many women are impacted by this. According to 2022-23 data from the Australian Taxation Office, women make up up to 60 per cent of those who still owe repayments on their HELP debts. The average debt is $26,000, and women's debts are larger because they owe 58 per cent of the overall debt. Writing for Women's Agenda earlier this year, Dr Marg Rogers noted that the indexation of HELP debt 'is more likely to hit women harder because women take longer to pay off their student loans'. She noted that that is unfortunately because women, amongst other factors:</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, still, young women studying at universities are set to benefit from the measures in this bill. The prac payments for those training in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work are a welcome development. From July 2025, eligible students will be able to access some $319.50 per week while they're undertaking a placement; a means test will apply. Placement poverty is a real issue, including for those in Warringah, and I am glad that there is now a program in place to help alleviate that for them. And, yes, of course, many in those sectors are women; these are highly feminised sectors. According to the statistics of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, women make up almost three-quarters of education and health students at Australian universities. In nursing, women are nearly 90 per cent of the workforce in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that this is another step that the government has taken in relation to greater gender equality, and I very much welcome it. Along with paid parental leave, superannuation and child care, it's another step in the right direction, but of course more can be done. Whilst the debt write-off, indexation change and prac payments in the bill are welcome, they're only a start. For example, there are many recommendations remaining from the Universities Accord, and I encourage the government to act on further changes before the end of this year—particularly on that change to the indexation date that I referred to earlier. We know that will make a tangible difference to students, and we really need to go a lot further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've received a lot of positive feedback from Warringah residents and students since it was announced, many who had in fact signed the petition from the member for Kooyong. Many medical students and veterinary students and those studying to become psychologists will miss out, and these are key industries in which we know we have major shortages. I encourage the government to also look at medical students, veterinary students, those studying to become psychologists and all other areas requiring prac placements—at anyone who has a practical element in their degree and cannot access a payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament, the Morrison government also introduced some very controversial changes to the cost of tertiary education—in particular when it came to humanities degrees. I strongly opposed those changes then and I call on the government to revisit and reverse the decision. It inappropriately and substantially increased the cost of humanities degrees compared to others. As a society, we need all levels of education. We really will benefit from having all areas available to many, especially to young people. So I think it's really important that, while the government is making improvements here, it looks to reviewing the changes that were made by the previous government when it came to the cost of university degrees and, in particular, humanities degrees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are a number of amendments that will be discussed that will go to some of the points that I have raised and I look forward to further questions with the minister in relation to that process. But I do commend the government for taking this good first step in relation to this problem.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I'm very pleased to be speaking on the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill and I thank the member for Warringah for her contribution. It was a very measured contribution in which I think she made some excellent points. I also think the member for Warringah rightly pointed out that some really important steps have been put forward in the bill. Obviously the university sector is one that is ever evolving and one where we need to continue to strive. While there are a whole range of issues around access and around student wellbeing and student welfare that need to be captured and dealt with, this bill is a very good piece of legislation that will make some significant changes to the lives of university students in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might start with some personal reflections. I, like many members in this place, had the privilege of attending university—one of the outstanding universities in this country. But my grandparents, especially on my father's side, left school when they were 13 and 14, and I know from my own family that the ability, privilege and opportunity to go to university was not a reality for generations past. They then moved to Australia and were able to provide a situation where my father's generation and our generation were all able to access higher education and further training post school. We all finished school, and my generation went to university. It was a great privilege, and it meant that there was social mobility, that there were options in life and that Australia was a place where, it didn't matter where you came from or what your background was, university was an option, and, if you wanted to strive to get to university, it wasn't necessarily going to be easy, but it was going to be possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's exactly what the HECS system was all about. It was about ensuring that Australia had a system where people could access university regardless of whether they could pay for it upfront. The HECS system was originally designed to be a low-interest loan system where students would not be penalised and students would have the lowest interest possible, but, with the high inflation, what that meant was that students had ever-increasing university bills, and that is one of the key reforms outlined in this bill, which I'll come back to in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I want to mention on this bill is that, inside Macnamara, we have a number of higher education providers, but we also have campuses of two of Melbourne's finest universities: Monash University and the University of Melbourne. Monash Caulfield campus is tucked away in one corner of my electorate, right on the edge, and the University of Melbourne Southbank campus is on the other end. Also the University of Melbourne is building a big engineering precinct in Fishermans Bend which is going to be one of the most exciting prospects for young engineering students in the country. It is going to be truly not only a national but a world leader in education, industry connections and practical applications. It is going to be a world-class institution, and we're very excited for that to be unfolding. There are so many wonderful universities around town, and there are so many wonderful universities in our country. I'm pleased to support them and pleased that they are providing so many opportunities to young students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that access to university is not straightforward and that students are being left with significant debt. We know that a whole range of issues, including student welfare and student wellbeing, are real and live, and they are things that were examined under the Universities Accord, which was the product of 12 months of work by the expert review panel. There were 785 public submissions, 150 meetings with stakeholders and a comprehensive report of 47 recommendations to make our higher education sector fairer and more accessible. I'm not going to go into all of the things that the accord did, but this bill has three important measures that are all about assisting with access to university, the cost-of-living pressures and mandatory training as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first measure, obviously, is the changes to HECS. As outlined in this bill, it will wipe $3 billion of student debt for more than three million Australians, and it will be backdated to 1 June last year. This means in practical terms that, if you've got a HECS debt of $26,500, for example, your HECS debt will be cut by around $1,200, which is significant, especially when you look at the scale and the number of people who will be affected by this. It's a really positive thing, and I think that we need to do as much as we possibly can to reduce the financial burden and financial strain on our students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the advantages of HECS has obviously been that more people have been able to go to university. The government no longer provides universal free university access, but it does mean that literally hundreds of thousands more people can access the university system and get a degree, which is obviously a huge benefit of the HECS system. This bill makes a fundamental reform to that system which changes the way in which the debt is indexed. This bill caps the indexation rate to the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once this legislation passes, individuals will receive a credit to their outstanding student loan debt balance for the difference between the indexation rate under the current legislation and the new indexation rate. For example, last year the CPI was 7.1 per cent, and we're replacing it with the wage price index's lower rate of 3.2 per cent. In my community of Macnamara, nearly 27,000 people will benefit from these changes. I'm really proud of that and I'm proud that, for all of those 27,000 people, they are going to get much-deserved support and financial credit in order to help them deal with the very real challenges around the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second important measure that this bill introduces is around paid prac. For the first time, the government will introduce paid prac to support teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students to do mandatory placements. These are critical workforces. We know that we absolutely need to be doing more to support our teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers. But we also expect them, as part of their training, to go to schools, to go to hospitals and to be in the field working and supporting those who they will be, ultimately, working for throughout their work. We know that part of their training is not just theoretical. In order to turn a student into a teacher or a nurse, we need to ensure that those young people or those trainees have access to practical placements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there are other industries that also have a similar arrangement but we have said that these four will be covered as part of this bill. Obviously, when you have a track record of supporting people through these arrangements then you will always look to do more. Let's make sure that the bill gets passed, ideally, in a bipartisan way. Let's get that support in for teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers and then obviously, in the future, we will look to do as much as we possibly can. I've had conversations with people doing mandatory placements in other fields and I absolutely think we can certainly advocate on their behalf and ensure that their voices are heard inside government decision-making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really proud of these reforms and proud that those four categories of training and paid prac will be covered. Students will be paid for their placement. If you are a young person and thinking about a career in teaching or nursing or midwifery or social work, it's an incentive to really consider those pathways and to know that you will have the option of being supported while doing your paid prac.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities Australia, the peak body for universities across the country, about paid prac, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Commonwealth Prac Payment means fewer Australians will have to choose between paying the bills and studying for the qualifications they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long students in so many fields but especially in these four have had to move mountains to finish their paid prac and continue on with their daily lives. Hopefully, this will mean they get the support they deserve. These are four industries that are ultimately not the highest-paid industries and we desperately need those who go into them. We rely on them, we value them and we want them to look after our young people, to look after our patients, to look after some of the most vulnerable people and those people who need social services. That is exactly what we want them to do and we want quality people in those fields because they make our whole community and our whole society better as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure in the bill is the fee-free uni-ready courses. The Universities Accord was very clear that we need a lot more people going to university and enrolling in VET courses to deliver the large skilled workforce we need for the future, and these reforms will assist more Australians in taking the step of getting into university. The fee-free uni-ready courses are described as a bridge between school and university to equip young people with the skills they need at university. We will be investing $350 million over four years to deliver this new and vital scheme. This is particularly important, as this will assist students who are from underrepresented backgrounds, ensuring university and higher education is accessible for all, which, I believe, is a fundamental core belief of the Australian Labor Party, which has assisted my family and is one that I am proud to work for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this is a bill that supports students. It will support those who have finished their studies by reducing their HECS debt. It will support those who are accumulating studies and it will reform HECS so it always has the lowest form of interest in their loan. It will always be as affordable as possible for our students. We know how challenging it can be for our young people and we want to support them. That's the first measure I'm really proud of. It will help create a bridge between school and university and it will also pay people to do the mandatory prac during their time at university in those four incredibly important professions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Minister for Education for his work in pulling this together. It is an outstanding piece of reform. It is one I'm very proud of, and I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  When it was first introduced in 1989, the HECS scheme was the world's first national income-contingent charging mechanism for higher education. In 1989, only 12 per cent of Australians had a university degree. The idea was that students who benefited from their tertiary education by earning average or higher incomes would then contribute to the cost of that education, primarily by making repayments after finishing their studies such as to enable the creation of additional spots for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The growth in higher education over the last three decades, with the expansion of student loan schemes and the tightening of repayment arrangements, has damaged students' experiences of tertiary education in Australia. It now costs much, much more for students to study at a university. For courses with government subsidies, the expected contribution has increased from about 20 per cent to about 48 per cent of student course costs. Students now finish their degrees with average debts of $50,000 to $60,000. They're taking, on average, about 12 years to repay their debts, and repayment times are trending upwards. This is occurring in a cost-of-living crisis. Graduates are struggling to get home loans. Many are deferring having a family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The burden of HECS debts is greatest on women, who take longer to pay back their debts and end up paying back more. In this country income 10 years after graduation is more strongly associated with gender than with field of study. Men earn $27,000 more than women 10 years after graduation. The lower payment threshold enacted in 2019-20 now reduces the incentive for women to work, and it can create poverty traps for families. A single parent with two children and an income between $46,000 and $100,000 will lose, on average, 70c of every extra earnt dollar due to reduced family benefits, increased tax, Medicare and HECS repayments. The recent Australian Universities Accord recommended significant reforms to make this HECS system more fair. This legislation goes some way towards that but not nearly far enough. We need this government to act more quickly and more effectively to fix the broken HECS system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal funding of Australian universities has now decreased from 80 per cent in 1992 to around 35 per cent today. In 1996 student fees constituted about 10 per cent of universities' income. For some tertiary centres that figure is now 70 per cent. Most university revenue is from domestic and international student fees. Pivoting to a revenue stream dependent on very high proportions of international students, the large universities have now resorted to workforce casualisation and increased class sizes. They've reduced contact hours for students, and they've increased workloads for academic staff. Our universities have lost more than 46,000 full-time academic staff over the last decade alone. At the same time, the dilution of course requirements, larger class sizes, soft marking for international students and forced group assignments have lessened the educational experience for Australian students. Domestic enrolments have plateaued, drop-out rates are at a historic peak, an increasing number of school leavers are deferring commencing their studies and more young Australians are undertaking their tertiary education overseas because it is cheaper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">HECS is a really big part of this problem. In recent years the annual indexation of HECS by the rate of inflation has resulted in significant increases in residual student debt. The outstanding HECS debts owed by graduates have ballooned from $22.5 billion in 2011 to $78 billion in 2023. Many young Australians had no idea what they were getting into when they signed up to university at the age of 17 or 18. Greater inflation has resulted in indexation of 3.9 per cent and then 7.1 per cent in the last two years. The tax office collects HECS payments on an ongoing basis during the year, but it doesn't adjust the balance owing until a tax return is filed. That's after indexation is applied. So graduates have been finding that their debts have been increasing despite their best efforts to pay them off. It is outrageous that payments made during the year are not taken into account when a student's debt is indexed. My generation would not put up with this creative accounting on our mortgages, but we're expecting the next generation to put up with what amounts to cynical gouging by the Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, in 2020 the Morrison government introduced not only a more challenging regime for repayments but also the Job-ready Graduates Package for degrees such as arts, commerce, accounting and business. The cost of these degrees more than doubled overnight, from about $16,000 to as much as $51,000, purely because of the Morrison government's wish to dissuade students from undertaking courses which it, in its infinite lack of wisdom, felt to be of limited value. This, while other courses—nursing, foreign languages and others—cost less than $5,000 a year. The gap between the cheapest and the most expensive courses doubled to more than $10,000 a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The indexation of these fees rubs further salt into the wounds. The truth is that, in a post-truth world plagued with populism and polarisation, we need more, not fewer, graduates with high levels of literacy, the capacity for nuanced thought and debate and the ability to communicate complex ideas. Graduates from varied ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds will be the thought leaders of tomorrow, and they should reflect the diversity of Australian society. The job-ready graduates scheme didn't align with labour market outcomes. It didn't align with national priorities or projected skills shortages. It left a frightening number of students facing debt far higher than was anticipated when HECS was first introduced. That is debt which is vastly disproportionate to the future earning potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The job-ready graduates scheme succeeded in decreasing the number of students undertaking arts, commerce, law and psychology degrees, but only by 1.5 per cent. It markedly increased the disparity in debts incurred by students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, First Nations students and women. Debts of $30,000 to $50,000 are common. Debts over $100,000 are not rare. The program was not just flawed and ineffective policy; it persists as an indictment of the Morrison government's intellectual poverty. It should be dismantled immediately. To add insult to injury, since September 2023, banks must, under updated regulatory guidelines, include HECS debts in home loan application calculations. This means that residual HECS debts reduce graduates' borrowing power by between $15,000 and $104,000. The Universities Accord also recommended that we address this inequity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's in this setting that the University Accord has suggested significant changes to the HECS system, of which some are being enacted through this legislation. A significant initial change is reform of HECS indexation, to cap it to the lower of the consumer price index or the wage price index. This change will ensure that outstanding loans will not grow faster than the average wage. The new indexation cap has a retroactive effect from 1 June 2023, introducing an indexation credit to HECS accounts, which will help more than three million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes are in response not only to the Universities Accord report but also to the sustained and unified efforts of the 2.9 million Australians with HECS debts who have, for two years, represented their need, their want and their desire for the Albanese government to change the system as strongly as they can and the efforts of the 288,000 Australians who signed my petition to fix the broken HECS system. To them are owed the changes in indexation and the refunding of $3 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also creates a support payment to help students bear the cost of participation in mandatory practical training. The University Accord recommended this form of support to students in the care and education sectors, but the legislation affords it only to the approximately 68,000 students who are undertaking teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work studies. There is really no clear or justifiable rationale for excluding students of medicine, radiography, allied health and other health sector professions—students who are also required to undertake compulsory placements. Some of them have told me that they find themselves paying rent in two places. Some of them find themselves sleeping in cars on their country placements. Some have to take time off to save before they can take those placements. Placement poverty doesn't distinguish between different academic disciplines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment will be means tested, and it will be matched to the Austudy rate of about $8 an hour, but all details of the scheme have been left, at this point, to the delegated legislation, which renders it very susceptible to repeal. The government intends that prac payments will be administered by the universities, but they do not generally administer Commonwealth supports. It appears that there may be a cap on the number of supported placements allocated to each institution. We have limited insight into the practicality of the scheme. We have doubts about its equity and residual concerns regarding the potential for it to be repealed by subsequent governments. The scheme should be administered by the government. It should include all care sector degrees necessitating practical placements away from home for anything more than four weeks. It's time to show real commitment to students who are making sacrifices to undertake the courses that we need them to take.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we value education, if we value the skills that graduates bring to our society and if we wish to ensure Australia's future, we have to ensure that all Australian students share in the opportunity to benefit from our world-class educational institutes and that all of us can benefit from the fruit of their studies. Students should be able to make choices in line with their strengths and preferences. Course funding should include an appropriate balance between student and government contributions, recognising both the public and private benefits from higher education. Equal or flat-rate student and government contribution rates should be the starting point, with differentiation based on clear evidence for this. This would be simpler. It would minimise inequality, and it would be more justifiable to the public. For student contributions, graduate employment is the clearest and most valid evidence for differentiation of costs, which approximate the private benefits from education. A government contribution system differentiated by cost of delivery but not employment would ensure that universities supply higher-cost courses of interest to students which are aligned with national priorities. A government which is truly serious about improving educational outcomes and stimulating research and innovation would commit to the full funding of our universities. That would ensure adequate places for all competent students. It should adequately and actively address the inequities in our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot more to be done to make the HECS system simpler and more fair. Let's remember that, in many cases, the graduates who are now experiencing bloated HECS debts are the generation of young Australians who are still making up for time lost during the COVID-19 crisis, a time in which we confined them to their homes and they often received a third-rate educational experience delivered online. That educational experience has not improved in the post-pandemic years. This is a generation which now, in the face of a cost-of-living crisis and a crisis of home affordability and availability, is being burdened with unprecedented levels of personal debt arising from their attempts to equip themselves with the skill sets required for their adult lives. This is a generation which understands that Australian university students contribute more to government revenue than the oil and gas revenue pays in its super profits tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must immediately reverse the gross inequities visited upon art students by the Job-ready Graduates scheme. I will move an amendment to that effect in the Consideration in Detail stage of this legislation. I will also move an amendment allowing for the payments made by Australians to be accredited to their accounts before indexation is applied each year, to stop this government from gouging extra money from the young and the vulnerable. The Australian tertiary education system is, at this time, broken. A government that really believes in it will demonstrate the commitment required to fixing it, and it will do that now.</span>

This bill is incredibly important, and it is an effort from our government to wipe $3 billion of student debt. Three million Australians right across the country will benefit from this, including 22,264 people in my local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will reform our HECS-HELP system to ensure that outstanding student loans never again grow faster than average wages. In doing so, our government is making it easier for young Australians with student debt to prepare for their future, to save for a home deposit, to set themselves and their families up for the best possible future. Our government does understand that at the moment people are feeling cost-of-living pressures. We are determined to support Australians, and we are, through measures like this, reducing student debt through tax cuts for every taxpayer, energy bill relief, cheaper medicines and much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand that higher education is transformative and that access to it is important not just for individuals but for us as a community and a country as a whole. So, for all of these reasons, this bill is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill, our government is providing direct cost-of-living relief for students who in the past were facing the impost of having to do prac placements that they weren't paid for. The introduction of a weekly Commonwealth prac payment will support around 68,000 teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students a year, helping them complete their university placements. It is absolutely clear to all of us that people in these sectors are essential to keeping our communities going, so our government is backing them in, demonstrating how much we value the contribution they are making as students and also the contributions we know they will make over time to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This support will help students directly where the financial impact of a mandatory prac placement may otherwise mean they have to defer their studies or withdraw altogether due to those increased costs and the reduced capacity to undertake paid work. We've heard about this directly from people who have been affected by this—for example, Elijah, a nursing student who lives out of home. He said that having a paid placement would mean a great deal to him because over the six weeks of the prac he'd still have money coming in, even if he couldn't do his part-time job, and that would help take some of the financial pressure off him during a busy time. Claire, a midwifery student, is also a mum to two young kids. Claire was facing the juggle of 16-hour days between her placements and casual work while also caring for her kids. Claire said the paid prac is going to be life-changing for her and an incredible opportunity for her and other mature age students to help make the switch into a degree that they're passionate about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Teaching, nursing, midwifery, social work—we rely on all these professions as a community and country. Our government is backing in students to undertake this work, to undertake these paid pracs and to make sure that they are getting jobs and getting into the industries that we need them in for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill, we are also effectively uncapping fee-free uni-ready courses across Australia, which will help more students make the jump to university study and succeed when they get there. We are establishing the Commonwealth grants scheme funding cluster for these courses, which will act as a bridge between school and university to provide foundational skills. We're also supporting students by requiring that higher education providers allocate a minimum of 40 per cent of their student services and amenities fees revenue to student-led organisations. This will ensure that students have a significant voice in how their services and amenities fees are spent. I know that that's a development that will be welcome news for students in my local area, including at La Trobe University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents a significant step forward in implementing the recommendations of the Universities Accord and building a better and fairer education system. The accord is the largest and the most wide-ranging review of higher education conducted in this country in 15 years. I think it speaks to how this government approaches the challenges that are before us. We do the hard work. We look at what needs to change, and then we get on with it. We do recognise how important it is to be planning for our country's future, ensuring that we're supporting Australians not just for today but for tomorrow. This is the work that will make sure that our tertiary education system is not just fit for purpose now but is actually fit for purpose for the generations to come. I know that will be important to many people in my community, not just to students at the moment but also to those who are thinking about that intergenerational piece and the fairness and the opportunities they want for those to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's wiping of $3 billion worth of student debt will be a game changer for so many Australians. I want to highlight that that will include a number of women. This reform will benefit more than 1.8 million women with an outstanding student loan. As of June last year, women represented around 61 per cent of all people with a student debt. They held around 59 per cent of outstanding student debts. Again, this isn't just good on an individual level; it is good for our entire country and good for Australian women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Commonwealth prac payment in particular will have a very positive impact on gender equality. As I mentioned earlier, this payment is supporting around 68,000 teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students a year to complete their university placements, targeting cohorts of people who can be typically disadvantaged and helping to address these gender segregated industries. We know that these are workforces that are dominated by women and that women want to work in, and this payment will make such a difference to them. Female education is concentrated in female dominated occupations, and these occupations are too often characterised by lower levels of status and earnings. According to 2022 higher education enrolment data, women make up 88 per cent of nursing, 75 per cent of teaching and 85 per cent of social work enrolments. These women training to do this critical work in our community will be receiving direct support through the Commonwealth prac payment. I hope not only that it will support these women but also that we continue to have more men seeing that they can take up roles in these industries and that they can do it without financial disadvantage. I hope we see men pursuing careers in teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard from many people in my community concerned about HECS debt. It comes from young people who are studying at the moment at La Trobe University, which is just over the border in Bundoora; those who are jumping on the train to the University of Melbourne or RMIT; and those heading across the city to Monash. They have all been clear with me that the prospect of student debt has genuinely made them worry about their future. Since our government made the announcement earlier this year that we would be wiping $3 billion worth of student debt, I've spoken to many students, and I know that this decision is one that comes as a huge relief for them. This reform is not just for current students; it is for those with an existing HECS debt as well. People in my community who have had student debt for several years will also benefit from this debt relief our government is delivering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, I know that parents and grandparents have been worried about this issue of HECS debt, and I've had some of them stop me in the street or write to me, telling me that they want to make sure that their kids and their grandkids can set themselves up for the kind of future that they were able to set themselves up for—that intergenerational peace of fairness. I know that they will be relieved to see this, and I want to highlight some of the locals who have contacted me about this, like Paul from research, who sent me an email earlier this year. Paul told me he had never written to a local member before but was compelled to reach out to tell me about his son. Paul's son is undertaking his first year at a university in the city, studying a business degree. Paul told me: 'We're proud of him achieving a solid result after a torrid time in COVID and getting a placement in the course he wanted. Tempering that result is the absolute horror I now feel about the burden he will face in regard to his HECS debt.' The bill is good news for Paul and his son.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For someone who is at the end of their degree—maybe in business or something else—who in the past would have been looking at a HECS debt of about $60,000, their debt will be cut by $2,700 this year alone. Someone with an average debt of $26,500 will see about $1,200 wiped from their outstanding loan this year. For someone with a debt of $45,000, it will mean that their debt is cut by about $2,000. I know that this will make a real difference to those students. It will make a real difference in how they can approach their studies and also in the certainty with which they can approach their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just a one off; it is for this year and for the years to come. Janine from Eltham contacted me in 2023 about the impact of the indexation rate then on her ability to pay her student debt. Janine told me that at that time it meant that she needed to find in excess of $4,000 a year simply to stop her HECS debt growing. Without paying it down, she felt like she would need to do this every year forever. Janine, I am very pleased to say that our government's changes mean that not only are we cutting your HECS debt but also that we will backdate it to last year. We will wipe out what you were writing to me about last year when that indexation came into place. We will make sure it never happens again by setting HECS at either inflation or wages, whichever is the lowest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are others in my community who've contacted me about this. Todd and Sally from Viewbank—who responded to my community survey earlier this year and told me they were concerned about the impact of indexation on their two daughters and their study—Christine from Eltham, Tim from Watsonia North, Wendy from Viewbank, Ian from Heidelberg and Margaret from Rosanna are just some of the locals who have written to me to share their thoughts and who I am very pleased to be able to tell today that our government has listened, that our government recognises how important access to a higher education degree is for them, for their children and for the future of our country, and that we are doing the reform work that will set us up to be able to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we will be wiping around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians, and that will ease pressure on workers. It will ease pressure on students right across the country. It provides significant relief for students while continuing to protect the integrity and the value of the HELP and other student loan systems, which, again, all the evidence shows us, have massively expanded tertiary access for more Australians. It's a system that is worth protecting and sustaining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does cap the HELP indexation rate to the lower of either the consumer price index or the wage price index, and it backdates these changes to 1 June 2023. For students, once this legislation passes, individuals will receive a credit to their outstanding student loan debt balance for the difference between the indexation rate under current legislation and the new indexation rate. These changes cover HELP, VET student loans, Australian apprentice support loans and other student loan accounts that existed on 1 June last year. This will benefit all of those Australians with a student loan. It will fix the issues of last year's spike in the CPI indexation rate of 7.1 per cent, and it will prevent future growth in debt from outpacing wages. As I've said, that is not insignificant for an individual with an average HELP debt of $26,500. Around $1,200 will be wiped from their outstanding HELP loan when this legislation passes. This change provides relief for students at the moment while also making sure that we are setting our higher education system up for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, again, we are backing in students who are studying in some of the most important areas for our country. I am particularly pleased to see the prac payments coming into place, recognising that we do need students to be studying nursing, we do need students becoming midwives and we do need students becoming teachers. We need to recognise that there is a burden that has been put on those people. As I've said, many of them are women choosing to take up these professions and facing a really difficult choice as to whether they can make decisions to study, continue to work part time and also care for their children at the same time. I know that, for all of those people, this decision is going to make a huge difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a good day when we get to set up our higher education system for the future of this country. It is a good day when we get to support students with very real cost-of-living relief. It is a good day when we get to continue to make sure that our country is a fair place into the future and that we are offering the opportunities of higher education, with all that that entails, to Australians now and into the future. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  Nothing is a greater demonstration, perhaps, of the hypocrisy in this place than when it comes to HECS debt—the fact that so many politicians in this place got to go to university for free, graduate without any student debt and often buy a house for a much smaller fraction of their income than people do now, and then those same politicians in this place turn around and declare that it's okay for students to cop tens of thousands of dollars in HECS and HELP debt, in student debt, and pay tens of thousands of dollars just to go to university, often when they're told that the only way they're going to get a job is by going to university. Nothing is a better demonstration of the rank hypocrisy in this place than both Labor and the Liberals declaring that it's okay to charge students tens of thousands of dollars to go to university and cop massive HECS debts that are barely being changed by this government bill, the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Bill 2024. The idea that this is something to crow and brag about, to make a marginal reduction in the indexation rate for HECS debt—that's still going up, by the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that student debt in this country is $78 billion. The government are crowing about a $3 billion reduction, which will be about a four per cent reduction on student debt, which will then go up next year anyway when it is indexed again because the government have not got rid of indexation; they have just tweaked it—as if rearranging the deckchairs on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>. The consequences are very real for students in this country, because when they graduate, they cop a massive HECS debt. Then, when they have to get a loan from the bank, they are told—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Today I rise to speak on an issue that hits close to home for many of us Gold Coasters, one that affects the very fabric of our communities and our economy—that is, small business. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. The Gold Coast is the small business capital of Australia, so we understand this all too well in my electorate of Fadden. We love our local cafes that bring life to the community, the family owned businesses that have served generations, the butcher or the baker that provide us with advice about what we should buy and how we should cook it. The goods and the relationships formed are all essential to our way of life and to the local economy. But under this Labor government, these businesses are at breaking point, struggling under the weight of policies and red tape that seem to disregard their contribution to our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many examples of businesses that are struggling or have closed, but I will use just one example. Black Hops Brewing at Biggera Waters, who I recently visited, are barely surviving. They have been through the wringer. First, they survived COVID, but, now supplier prices are going up, they pay a container tax on every can that leaves their door, and, of course, the dreaded alcohol excise has just gone up and up. They have just come through administration. Let's hope that this time around they can make a go of it, if not for the owners of that business then for the 80 employees, the ones who take that pay packet home to their families to feed them and house them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006, at the age of 26, I started my own small law practice and, believe me, as a small-business owner, I remember all too well the struggle to meet payroll during the GFC that hit shortly after I opened. I remember paying everyone else's superannuation except my own. I understand what businesses are currently feeling. They are hurting. They are hurting because electricity prices have gone through the roof. They are hurting because inflation has seen the cost of goods supplied increased. They are hurting because of impossible-to-navigate industrial relations frameworks. They are hurting because interest rates on their home loans and their business loans have gone up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now economists are saying we are weathering the worst economic conditions since the 1990s, and we have seen an unprecedented number of business insolvencies in the past financial year, 2,036 in Queensland alone. I heard a member opposite speaking earlier about how this was just a very small percentage of all small businesses. But let's just reflect on the fact that that was 2,036 dreams shattered, hopes lost and probably a lot of money down the drain. These are real people whose dreams and livelihoods have been shattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has presided over the highest number of business failures on record. This is not a reflection of the resilience of the Australian small-business community. With the help of a strong coalition government, they showed grit and determination during a once-in-a-century pandemic as they adapted and overcame extraordinary challenges. During that time we had a coalition government that stood by them, providing the support they needed to navigate adversity. Fast forward to today and, under the Labor government, small businesses are being hung out to dry. In my electorate on the Gold Coast we are witnessing first-hand the impacts of policy failures, with local businesses closing their doors—businesses that have survived decades selling out, taking with them the vibrancy and character that not only define our community but also provide a livelihood for so many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, new figures from the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman show a 50 per cent increase in requests for help from distressed business owners. The number signals that there are deep cash-flow issues. Small businesses are trying to draw on their cash reserves to stay afloat, but, quite frankly, they just don't have them. Recent surveys reveal one in four have no cash reserves and 18 per cent have less than a month's worth of cash to meet their obligations. These are businesses on edge. These are businesses that are struggling because of the Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise today to speak to a matter that touches each of us deeply—the health and wellbeing of our electorates—which resonates for me in my community of Pearce. As we all know, good health is fundamental to our quality of life, and ensuring access to comprehensive and timely medical care is essential. Today, I want to highlight the remarkable progress we have made in enhancing healthcare access as we celebrate our current facilities and underscore the urgent need for continued expansion to meet the growing demands of our rapidly expanding region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has invested significantly in expanding urgent care services through the establishment of Medicare urgent care clinics across the nation. This initiative is a strategic move to alleviate the pressure on hospital emergency departments, allowing them to focus on the most critical, life-threatening conditions. To date, 58 Medicare urgent care clinics have been launched, with an additional 29 announced in the latest federal budget. In Western Australia, we have seen the establishment of seven Medicare urgent care clinics, including, in my Pearce electorate, the Ocean Keys Family Practice in Clarkson. This facility, which began operations in August 2023, is a prime example of how urgent care is being redefined. By providing bulk-billed walk-in care seven days a week, this clinic offers a vital service for treating non-life-threatening conditions that would otherwise crowd emergency rooms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These urgent care clinics are more than just a convenience; they're a critical component of our healthcare system. They offer immediate care for issues like minor injuries, infections and other non-urgent conditions. This model not only improves patient outcomes by reducing waiting times but also prevents the overflow of cases into emergency rooms, ensuring that those with the most severe conditions receive the attention they need in a timely manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to another exciting development, we welcomed and celebrated the official opening of the ECU Health Centre in Yanchep two weeks ago. This new facility represents a significant leap forward in our healthcare infrastructure. Located in the heart of Yanchep, in the most northern part of my Pearce electorate, this one-stop shop will provide a comprehensive range of services, including general practice, nursing and allied health, as well as mental health support. This facility not only will address the current health needs of Yanchep and the surrounding suburbs, as well as servicing the expending regional north, but will be a hub for clinical training and research. By integrating health service delivery with education opportunities, it will contribute to the development of the future health workforce, ensuring that our region is equipped with skilled professionals who can meet the demands of a fast-growing population. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Professor Codie Rudd, from Edith Cowan University, who worked tirelessly for a number of years to bring this vision to reality. It was an absolute pleasure to work alongside Professor Rudd during this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these advancements, we must acknowledge the challenges that remain. The northern corridor of Pearce is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. This region is expected to see a population increase of nearly 300 per cent between 2024 and 2046, to nearly 38,000 residents. This extreme rapid growth brings with it a significant rise in demand for health services. While the ECU Health Centre in Yanchep is a crucial step forward, it is clear that we will need more facilities to adequately meet the needs of our expanding community. The demand for health care in Yanchep and the surrounding area is already high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to affordable, high-quality health services is not just a matter of convenience; it is a necessity for maintaining the health and wellbeing of our growing population. Our existing health services have done an outstanding job of supporting our community, but we need to continue advocating for additional resources and facilities. In closing, we must continue to push for the expansion of our health services, and, with the support of the Albanese Labor government, we can ensure that facilities in the northern corridor of Pearce not only meet the health challenges of today but also are prepared for the demands of tomorrow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="267506" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KENNEDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  The cost-of-living crisis is hurting the community of Cook. I'd like to highlight three organisations that are bringing light to people's lives in these trying times. First, the Dandelion Support Network is doing exceptional work for families, babies and children. They are supporting families who are finding themselves in hardship and victims of domestic violence by donating children's and babies' goods. This charity, run locally in the Sutherland Shire, repurposes these items to help families in need, preventing waste from going to landfill. Over 80 volunteers tirelessly manage the sorting, cleaning and compiling of these donated items, ensuring each of them reach a family in need. This support network is led by general manager Gabrielle Humphreys and manager of corporate partnerships James Lavender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been to visit these facilities, and it's one of the best run charities with some of the most hardworking people I have seen. In 2023 alone, more than 2,700 families were helped, and Dandelion is on track to help even more this year. The items provided are prams, cots, baby clothes, car seats and more, donated by local families in the Sutherland Shire and St George areas. On 21 September from 9.30 am to 3.30 pm, Dandelion are holding a donation drive. They're calling on community members to bring any spare baby gear, arts and craft materials, and children's clothes for children up to 16 years of age. I will be in attendance with my family, collecting and sorting these goods, so I'm encouraging all community members to go through your cupboards and bring the stuff down. For those of you who can't make it, monetary contributions can be made via their website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to speak about another community organisation: Project Youth. Project Youth focuses on the prevention of youth homelessness through early interventions such as family intervention with counselling; legal intervention, representing youth at the local juvenile courts; mental health intervention, helping manage the emotions of these young people; and education, including internal school programs for students who cannot attend normal schools. They also have crisis refuges, where Project Youth has provided youth housing in southern Sydney. They have 76 beds, including semi-supported, transitional and independent housing. I've visited Project Youth and met the young people they are helping. They've got a significant presence across our community, with 50 paid staff and 70 volunteers supporting people aged 12 to 24 across Sutherland Shire, Georges River and Bayside. I commend the work they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phoenix Community Project is another organisation I was fortunate enough to meet with. I visited this great local organisation, which has both disability support services and a youth centre. I was particularly impressed with their efforts to provide great education to kids who cannot attend school and have entered the criminal justice system. Only last week I personally met these young people who've undertaken this program, and I've seen what great work this organisation can do with very little funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see the impact this growing cost-of-living and inflation crisis is having on my community of Cook in the work these great organisations do, but they need more funding. Government needs to look at helping these organisations, be it through grants or other funding programs, to ensure this sector is resourced properly amid this growing cost-of-living crisis. Sadly, organisations I met with outlined the real impact of this funding gap and this cost-of-living crisis. For example, Project Youth had over 550 referrals that were received and turned away this year. That's almost a whole school of children who are not given support, who are left to languish in the community. Over 40 young people have stayed in Project Youth's crisis accommodation nine months longer than policy allows them, but there's nowhere for them to go. I call on the government to start looking at organisations like these three organisations in my community of Cook and support the fantastic work they do. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Australia has a deep-seated problem with domestic violence. Forty-seven women have been killed as a result of gender based violence in Australia this year, according to reporting from Destroy the Joint. No-one should lose their life to violence, least of all at the hands of those they love, trust or live with. No-one should live in fear of their life, especially within their own home. We must put a stop to domestic and family violence, and our government won't be satisfied until we have. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government are doing more than ever to end gender and family violence. That's why National Cabinet on Friday agreed to practical next steps, backed by a comprehensive $4.7 billion package. This coordinated approach across all states and territories brings together efforts and funding to deliver much-needed support for frontline specialist and legal services, backs innovative approaches to better identify and respond to high-risk perpetrators, and addresses the role that systems and harmful industries play in exacerbating violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will invest $3.9 billion in a new National Access to Justice Partnership over five years to ensure long-term funding for community legal centres and the legal assistance sector. We're investing $700 million in new matched investment from the Commonwealth, states and territories for a new five-year national partnership agreement on family and domestic and sexual violence responses. Eighty million dollars will be invested to enhance and expand child-centric trauma-informed supports for children and young people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that ending family and domestic violence can't be done without the support of states and territories. National Cabinet saw the first ministers agree to develop new national best practice family and domestic violence risk assessment principles, and support enhancements to the National Criminal Intelligence System to better support information sharing to assist police in responding to high-risk perpetrators. They have also committed to trial new deterrence models and domestic violence threat assessment centres to prevent homicides. States and territories have also committed to reviewing alcohol laws and their impact on family and domestic violence victims to identify and share best practice reforms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government also previously invested $925 million in a permanent new leaving violence payment, providing those eligible for the payment with up to $5,000 in financial support. The permanent program builds significantly on previous government investments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Ending Violence against Women and Children, alongside the member for Bass and Senator Waters, I've been proud to bring a wide range of perspectives to this place to discuss how we can prevent domestic violence. We have heard from leading advocates like former Australian of the Year Rosie Batty and key organisations involved in groundbreaking domestic violence prevention pilots, including Our Watch and Respect Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday we will mark National Survivors' Day here in parliament for the recognition and commemoration of the journeys of victims-survivors of sexual assault and institutional abuse across Australia. National Survivors' Day will be held on 12 November, and I encourage all of my colleagues in this place to mark the day within their communities to show support. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge World Suicide Prevention Day, which is marked on 10 September every year, which is tomorrow. World Suicide Prevention Day is a powerful day of global observance and understanding for people who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or have lost someone to suicide. Ten million people across our country have been impacted by suicide, 3,000 Australians die by suicide each year, and 55,000 Australians attempt suicide each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Suicide prevention is something that we—the community sector, the parliament and the government—can and must work together on. We must reduce discrimination, stigma and prejudice associated with suicidal behaviour so that people can seek the help that they need without fear of judgement. Many organisations do important work for suicide prevention, including Lifeline and Suicide Prevention Australia. Organisations like StandBy provide critical support for people in communities who are bereaved by suicide in supporting their grief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide was tabled here in the parliament, and we are more aware than ever of the need for action to prevent deaths by suicide. I just want to quickly acknowledge Julie-Ann Finney, who was in the chamber today for the tabling of that report. She lost her son David to suicide. He lived in my electorate, and I met with her quite early on. She has given her all to this, and seeing this report would mean so much to her and so many in our community today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I want to talk about the media bargaining code. When in government, the coalition put in place the news media bargaining code, and what this did was say, 'If you are a social media company and you are taking the intellectual property of Australian media publishers, you must pay for it.' Simple, right? If you are using the product of journalism that doesn't come for free and you're using that to build your business, you should pay for it. Famously, of course, the Treasurer at the time, Josh Frydenberg, went toe to toe with Mark Zuckerberg and had a series of interactions with Mr Zuckerberg. Facebook threatened to withdraw from the country; they did not. They paid for Australian journalism. That's what should have happened and what did happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My speech tonight will largely consist of quotes from government ministers, because it's a confusing picture; it's a picture of delay and malaise. If we go back to 18 December last year, the Assistant Treasurer said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But let us be very clear: we already have the power to designate digital platforms and we are prepared to use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We want to see news outlets and digital platforms come together and negotiate in good faith.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's saying there that he has the legal power through the news media bargaining code to force the tech giants to the bargaining table. That's what he said in December.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 March this year, Meta announced that it would stop paying Australian media companies for their intellectual property. On that day, the Minister for Communications and the Assistant Treasurer put out a joint statement. Let's hear what they had to say on that day, which was more than six months ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Meta's decision to no longer pay for news content in a number of jurisdictions represents a dereliction of its commitment to the sustainability of Australian news media.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They went on to ominously say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has made its expectations clear.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That kind of implies something is going to happen, doesn't it? That was 1 March, more than six months ago. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This will be devastating to Australian publishers. It will have a profound impact on the quality of news media in this country—in terms of its impact and reach in the Australian community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 April this year, the Assistant Treasurer said that social media companies had a 'social responsibility'. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There needs to be a place where people can go and get fact-tested, reliable information. In Australia, journalism is one of the critical sources of that information.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If people are going to Facebook or other social media platforms for that information, then they should be able to get it there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day, 25 April, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, the communications minister was quoted as saying she was confident the government would 'get a result' in the code negotiations. How long is that? That's 4½ months ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 3 May in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, the communications minister said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We remain committed to the outcome, which is that we have a strong, sustainable public interest journalism-based media in Australia. And we're committed to the code process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 May in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, the Assistant Treasurer said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Meta seems more determined to remove journalists from their platform than criminals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're talking tough. He's saying that Meta is treating journalists worse than criminals. Again, it implies he's going to actually do something, doesn't it? That was 5 May, four months ago. He went on to say to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government has publicly and privately made our position to Meta very clear: Australian news media businesses should be fairly remunerated for news content used on digital platforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was four months ago that he said that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 June, the words of the Assistant Treasurer were a little bit softer. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, he said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I am awaiting Treasury's advice and will have more to say once I've considered both briefings.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he sort of bucked himself up on 28 June, when he said to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> that the government would 'not be held ransom by multinational companies who blatantly threaten to avoid' Australian law. Again, he was talking tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 July, not long ago, he said a 'whole-of-government response' was expected shortly. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… it won't end there, and you can expect us to have something to say about that in the near future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 March the government said that all resources and all ministers would be deployed on the issue, but on 3 December it was revealed that Meta had offered to speak to the Prime Minister. He said no. On 4 September it was revealed that the only minister who had engaged with Meta was the Assistant Treasurer. This issue has gone on for far too long. The powers are there. The government needs to resolve this issue and protect Australian journalism.</span>

                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I want to raise an issue which has serious environmental and economic impacts on our nation: tyres or, more importantly, the importation of second-hand tyres; the importation of blemished and old stock tyres; the lack of Australian design rules on tyres, the opportunity to create a circular economy; and the cost to local councils and communities of millions of dollars a year through the illegal dumping of tyres. These were issues I raised with the previous government but didn't even get the courtesy of a reply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I met with tyre industry leaders, including Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia; Silvio de Denaro from the Australian Tyre Council; David Hickey from One Michelin Group; and the former vice president of Goodyear Dunlop, Lou Mandacini. We all agreed there was a great opportunity to address the urgent need for cleaning up the waste and illegal dumping of tyres in our nation, illegal dumping costing millions of dollars every year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although local tyre manufacturing in Australia ceased back in 2010, there are many involved in the industry who are committed to taking responsibility for tyres through the supply chain. This includes voluntary participation in Tyre Stewardship Australia, a scheme which was proposed to drive sustainable outcomes for end-of-life tyres. Tyre Stewardship Australia and the VACC support a view that businesses operating in Australian retail tyre markets should be required to demonstrate a professional commitment to achieving a sustainable outcome for end-of-use tyres. It involves the participation of many family-owned and operated businesses, including tyre retailers and recyclers who operate in our electorate and across the country. It's the involvement of these small businesses that make the voluntary scheme operationally possible, but they are paying the price for the free riders who avoid cost and compliance responsibilities by illegally dumping tyres. You would think this sort of program would be something supported by both sides of politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the most recent year, 2022-23, Australia's recovery of used car, bus, automotive tyres has gone backwards. It dropped to 80 per cent from the 2019-20 peak of 90 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent equates to 1.3 million car tyres being stockpiled and illegally dumped in landfill or hidden in warehouses on industrial sites, unsuspecting landowner properties and even in our national parks. There is a significant cost for local governments in having to collect illegally dumped tyres, and this runs into the millions of dollars each year, ultimately costing ratepayers millions of dollars that could otherwise be used on improving services. We have already seen where illegally collected tyres have been stored in warehouses and then set alight, costing millions of dollars in emergency services and health costs, as well as the damage done to our environment and the price the communities have to pay as they deal with this thick wretched smoke for days. This is why the TSA supports their voluntary scheme becoming a mandatory one—one which, if properly regulated, would mean all of the participants in the tyre industry pay their fair share.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO research also recommends enacting not only a regulated tyre stewardship scheme but one that also includes the banning of landfilling and onsite disposal of end-of-life tyres and conveyor belts to support the value recovery and market development. A regulated scheme would open up opportunities for an enhanced tyre recycling industry in which more end-of-life tyres could be recycled and manufactured into value-added products in Australia, such as in concrete, footpaths, playgrounds and as a tyre product fuel. This would create economic and employment opportunities while also contributing to net zero emissions targets and the creation of a circular economy. This is particularly relevant given the recent announcement by the Treasurer and the environment minister that the Productivity Commission will inquire into the economic benefits of a circular economy. As the Treasurer noted, by reusing and recycling more of our waste, we can create more opportunities right through the supply chain for Australian companies and Australian workers. The tyre industry certainly has a role to play in this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tyre industry has been pretty clear it is prepared to be part of the government's plan to boost circularity across the Australian economy with the benefits of supporting an established industry that will help create sustainable and stable Australian jobs growth. I welcome the work being done by the environment ministers in this meeting, but I believe Australia should stop the importation of second-hand tyres and ensure that tyres that do come to this country are fresh and meet our proper design rules and standards. If the EU can do it, Australia should be able to as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  In a world where access to information is right at our fingertips, the debate about the role that social media plays in increasing the rate of youth mental health distress is one that elicits strong opinions. As the mother of three young adults, I've had firsthand experience of parenting digital natives. I am often blown away by how tech savvy they are, and I empathise with the many parents who fear they can't now control the type, accuracy or rate of information their children consume. This parental fear is understandable, yet, as the adults in the room begin a conversation that will ultimately determine how younger people across our society access social media, I've been asked by the youth of North Sydney to speak for them and make it clear they believe our government must base policy decisions on evidence, not simple political expediency. Young people in my electorate are very attuned to the challenges faced by their generation, and they want us to look closely at the risk factors and major generational and societal changes driving these challenges, rather than simply scapegoating social media as the primary factor in increasing mental health distress, as opposed to it being one influence, for, while some social media contact can be harmful, this channel often provides meaningful connections and reliable information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, I've focused on finding ways to facilitate a conversation which leads to effective, meaningful and positive change. Recently I heard speakers from the youth mental health organisations present research findings on social media's impact on youth mental health. The speakers emphasised the importance of recognising that this is a complex debate and that, if social media is banned for young people, alternative accessible mental health supports will need to be provided. They also challenged the idea that any technical ban would be enforceable or effective, and they encouraged all in attendance to focus on exploring the potential for content controls rather than channel bans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These findings reflected the anecdotal evidence I'd heard from my North Sydney Youth Forum, which brings 15- to 17-year-olds from across North Sydney together to discuss important topics. Working with the youth forum, I launched a community survey to understand how people are feeling more broadly about the debate. We received hundreds of responses from people of all ages, and it has opened a broader conversation which will now form the basis of a community forum. This intergenerational forum will bring young people together with their parents and carers and experts in the space to explore the topic further. Effective policy can only be developed once we understand how technology is used by young people and which patterns of usage are associated with benefits or harms, and that will rely on our capacity to listen to those whom this policy reform will affect.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  In Broadmeadows we love our coffee and we love giving support to young people and to people with disabilities to gain skills and experience for employment and for life. That's why I'm delighted to welcome our area's newest social enterprise, the Bean and Brite Cafe. Located in the Hume Global Learning Centre in Broadmeadows, the Bean and Brite Cafe is a partnership between Banksia Gardens Community Services, the Brite organisation and Hume City Council. The cafe offers training and employment opportunities for young people and people with disabilities. It also offers amazing coffee and delicious food. At Bean and Brite, employees can gain vital work experience in what may be their first paid job, helping them further develop their skills in a real-world environment. The new cafe joins an existing stable of dynamic social enterprises in the area, including Banksia Gardens' Common Bean cafes, located at Kangan TAFE and at the DPV Health GP clinic, and the Brite Cafe on William Barak Boulevard at the Northcorp Industry Park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like its hospitality siblings, the Bean and Brite Cafe is about inclusivity and creating opportunities. It's about tailored support, quality training, breaking down barriers and helping people to reach their full potential. The cafe, through its partner organisations, will tailor training programs to develop essential skills in cafe operations, customer service, food preparation and teamwork. Each team member receives personalised support to ensure that they develop transferable skills, experience and confidence to participate in further work, training or study. The experience team members gain will help nurture a sense of accomplishment and pride in professional development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these social enterprise cafes serve as hubs for social interaction and meaningful connections. Specifically, the Bean and Brite Cafe operates within the Hume Global Learning Centre, a busy hub that also includes the Broadmeadows public library. By welcoming both staff and patrons from diverse backgrounds, the cafe helps promote social inclusion. The Bean and Brite partnership is a shining example of what can be achieved through cooperation between dynamic local organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Banksia Gardens Community Services is a wonderful organisation that has developed a raft of innovative support programs primarily targeted at young people at risk of disengagement from the education system and struggling to enter the workforce. Brite is also a great organisation that I have worked with for many years, dedicated to support, inclusion, training and employment for local people with a range of disabilities. It makes so much sense that these groups would come together to maximise their skills, commitment, passion and outstanding human capital to build this enterprise, and I want to congratulate Hume City Council for its support of this great project.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  On 29 August I attended the Moon Festival celebration for the CASS seniors group in Hurstville. As it is every year, it was a fantastic event with people coming together to celebrate the very special time of year that is Moon Festival. There was moon cake. There was chocolate this year, as well. There was dancing and, most importantly, there was a lot of fun. I want to thank Tica Lee, the vice-chairperson of CASS; directors Teresa Chiu and Winnie Fung; and Ivan Wong, the general manager, who does an incredible job in managing so many aspects of CASS's activities. CASS has existed for more than 40 years, and it helps thousands of people in our community every year. Congratulations to CASS on another great Moon Festival event.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 August St George District Netball Association held their annual presentation day. It's always a great day. There are games. The finals are played, and everyone comes together for the presentation to acknowledge teams and players that have done exceptionally well during the year. Thank you to Marlise Edmondston, the vice-president and acting president, who is doing a lot of the heavy lifting at St George District Netball Association at the moment. She does a fantastic job, as does Lara Mina, the secretary, who has been involved with the association for many, many years. It was great to see representatives from the Titans, from Oatley and from Kyle Bay all being represented and coming together at the Rockdale courts for a terrific presentation day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 August I attended the Roselands Raptors medallion day at Bennett Park. It was great to chat with Kylie Kegg, the president; Fiona Ross, the registrar; and other members of the committee. Medallion day is something that is run by the Canterbury District Soccer Football Association. All the kids, in addition to perhaps getting trophies from their own club, also get a medallion from the association. It's something I haven't seen before, and I think it's a really good initiative. Kids came from all over Sydney for the medallion day event, and Bennett Park was seen to advantage. Thank you to Roselands Raptors for hosting me on the day, and congratulations on hosting a really large event, with people from all over Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lugarno FC is an iconic football club in our local community, and its player numbers are at record levels. More than 800 people signed up this year. On 24 August it was terrific to attend their presentation day and to catch up with the president, Sue Dick, who has been involved with the club for decades; the secretary, Michael Jarevski, who has served in different executive capacities over the years; and many other members of the executive. We were presenting awards for younger kids. Seeing the excitement and enthusiasm on their faces reminds us of why community sport is fundamental to our community and why Lugarno FC is such a great organisation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  There are more mums in Point Cook, in my electorate, than in any other suburb in Australia. It was the perfect place to host new families from Melbourne's west at my Welcoming the Babies event at the Saltwater Community Centre last week. We all know that being a new parent is both rewarding and challenging. Our Welcoming the Babies event allowed new parents to connect with each other, with local support groups and with local government support services in our community that are there to help. I want to thank everyone who participated in making the event a success: Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia, the Dil ki Baat women's group, Safety Seats, Tweddle Child and Family Health Service, the Australian Breastfeeding Association, Baby Presents, Wyndham City Council Maternal and Child Health Services, Services Australia and St John Ambulance Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government knows that the early years are the most important part of a child's life. We're supporting families to give children the best possible start, from expanding access to cheaper child care to delivering a wage rise for early childhood educators while keeping fees low for families. I know that it's been a tough time for families in our community. That's why the top priority of our government has been delivering responsible cost-of-living relief that doesn't add to inflation. Every family at the Welcoming the Babies event—indeed, every family in my community, from Newport to Point Cook, from Williamstown to Truganina—has been benefiting from cost-of-living relief measures introduced by our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Our tax cuts have increased the pay packets of 84,000 workers in my electorate by an average of $1,676. A family with a combined income of $120,000 will pocket an extra $2,300 a year, making a real difference to household budgets. Low-income workers have received three consecutive pay rises, including big rises for people in the care economy, like aged-care workers and childcare workers. Investing in and respecting the work of early childhood educators and carers will ensure that we continue to attract the best people to these sectors and we continue to deliver quality learning and care during the important early years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also delivering energy bill relief for every family, providing a $300 energy rebate for every household in Melbourne's west. We've also frozen the cost of PBS listed medicines—a big win for families. This means no-one will pay more than $32 for a script, and those with a pension or concession card won't pay more than eight dollars for the next five years. Australian families have already saved $525 million as a result. We've also strengthened Medicare, making it easier to see a bulk-billing doctor so new families can get the health care they need. Our actions have enabled an estimated two million additional free visits to doctors and are helping to take the pressure off families in Melbourne's west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all the families, community organisations and services who brightened the day by coming along to the Welcoming the Babies event, despite the rather typical Melbourne weather. I'll get to work on more face painting and storybooks right away and look forward to welcoming the newest members of our family again next year.</span>

                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  The Victorian Labor state government never ceases to amaze. It is spending billions and billions of dollars on the Suburban Rail Loop—wasting money. If we are elected to government federally, the coalition will not provide a cent for that project because we know that money needs to go into our roads. Here we have the roads minister, Melissa Horne, coming down to south-west Victoria and passing the buck on the Princes Highway. When we were in government, we gave $60 million to fix the Warrnambool to Port Fairy part of the Princes Highway. What has the state government done with that money? We said that because it's a road of national significance we would put in 80 cents for every dollar that was invested in that road. The state only had to put in 20 cents. We put in a further $80 million, yet she's saying that investment in that road didn't go up under us. What has happened since federal Labor got in though—and this is what she should have called out—is that they have dropped their contribution from 80 cents back to 50 cents, and that is why we're not seeing anything being done on that road. It's Labor versus Labor, and that means nothing is occurring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other great tragedy is that she talks about the maintenance budget. The maintenance budget for roads right across Victoria under the Victorian state Labor government is $964 million. That has been cut. That maintenance budget is for every single state government road right across the state. So, while they're putting $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion into the Suburban Rail Loop, they don't even put $1 billion into maintenance across the whole road network in Victoria. It is a disgrace. To come down to south-west Victoria and pass the buck—and that is what this headline in the Warrnambool<span style="font-style:italic;"> S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tandard</span> says: passing the buck on the highway is an utter, utter disgrace. It is only a coalition government federally and at the state level that can invest in these roads and that can invest in the Princes Highway because we understand how important it is to the local community; it is obvious. Labor, both federal and state, do not get that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also say to the minister that it was great that you were down at the Port Fairy wharf so that you were able to see another investment from us: $1.4 million invested into that precinct by the coalition government. We'd love to see you match that as well. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  On Saturday I was honoured to attend the Geebung RSL for a ceremonial day commemorating our Defence veterans who served in Afghanistan, East Timor and Iraq. It was a moving service, and I was pleased to see those in attendance paying tribute to those who've served our country in more recent years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the good work being done by the Geebung RSL sub-branch and, broadly, the RSL sub-branches in my electorate of Lilley who are reaching out and engaging with younger Defence veterans in our community in particular. There is thriving advocacy going on, particularly in Sandgate, and I congratulate those responsible for that proactive and important work. I am pleased that the Albanese government is supporting outreach like this through the Building Excellence in Support and Training—BEST—grants program. In my electorate of Lilley, the Sandgate RSL sub-branch has received $16,033 to support the work they do with our Northside veterans through the BEST program. The funding ensures that this important work can continue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Festival season is in full swing in my electorate of Lilley, and our glorious spring weather ensured that local residents were out and about on Brisbane's Northside last weekend. Built on the site of an old pineapple farm in 1964, St Kevin's Catholic Primary School at Geebung celebrated their 60th birthday with their 1960s-inspired spring fling on Saturday. I was pleased to join the school, its 350 students and their families as they donned their minidresses and their bell-bottom trousers to get into the spirit of this fundraiser, which sought to finance a new playground for the school. I was also happy to oblige when asked to bust out my best 1960s dance moves in a dance-off with the other politicians there. As federal Minister for Sport, it seemed only fitting that I chose to do the 'swim'. I will spare the chamber the re-enactment; the footage already lives forever online!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next it was off to the Brighton Bulldogs football club for their gala day. The club, which started with one under-12 team in 1966, fielded their first girls team back in the mid-seventies. They've now grown to more than 50 teams in 2024; they're thriving. I give a special shout-out to the division 7 men, who won the grand final, and the women's division 2 and women's division 4, who finished the season as premiers on top of their respective tables. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Nundah Festival is one of the highlights of the Northside festival calendar and was again a roaring success with thousands in attendance. It is a beloved tradition in the community. The Nundah Festival draws visitors from all corners of Brisbane and is where families, friends and neighbours come together to celebrate the spirit and diversity of Nundah. It was a great day; I can't wait for the next one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With my time remaining, I congratulate the Brisbane Lions on their thumping victory over the Carlton Blues on Saturday. May they now go to Greater Western Sydney on the weekend and reap some sweet justice on behalf of the Broncos against Greater Western Sydney. Good luck, boys. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  To all of the Australian Defence Force members, our veterans and your families: the freedoms that we enjoy today are on the back of the hard-fought battles, wars and sacrifices that you have made. Today the final report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide has been handed down. To the families—mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, children—and the mates who have had to bury their friends and loved ones I say sorry. I am sorry that you have had to endure such pain and that your loved one has succumbed to their war within back here on home soil. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This royal commission has shone a light into the darkest corners of Defence, Veterans' Affairs and the community. I think that the report today will make some significant highlights and that the government, with the coalition, will make sure the recommendations are implemented in a timely manner and that our bravest aren't succumbing to their war within. Many veterans in Townsville—many veterans around the country, their families, still-serving members—have contributed to this royal commission. Families who have had to relive the trauma of their loved ones who have died have contributed. As we've heard from the commissioners, it is on the government to make sure that they read this royal commission report and act on the recommendations that they have made. This morning, one of the commissioners said that there is nothing new in this report that we don't already know and that hasn't been done through other reports, but those other reports weren't acted upon. We will work closely with the families, the loved ones, Defence members, our veterans and the government to make sure that these recommendations are implemented. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those families that may be living this trauma again, I want to say that it's okay not to be okay, but it's not okay to suffer in silence. I'm sorry you've had to endure this. I'm sorry you've had to bury your loved one. It's a failure that I take responsibility for—and one that everyone that serves in parliament should wear as well—that we have had to come to a place where we've had multiple reports and another royal commission. We need to act now. We shouldn't be burying our bravest, those people who put on the uniform in the service of this nation. We should work together to implement these recommendations to protect our people who protect us. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  For 11 months the world has stood witness to the awful violence and suffering that has occurred and is occurring in Israel and in Gaza. This horrifying and brutal instalment of a long-running conflict began with a barbaric attack by Hamas on civilians in Israel, which included the taking of hostages, many of whom are still not free. Since that time, the government of Israel has inflicted carnage on a trapped and defenceless civilian population in Gaza. More than 40,000 civilians have died, the majority of whom are women and children. Indeed, more children have been killed in Gaza than in all other conflicts for the last four years. Russia's illegal aggression in Ukraine over the last 2½ years has resulted in the death of 11½ thousand civilians, including 630 children, from a population of 38 million. In Gaza, in less than a year, from a population of only two million, 40,000 civilians have died and more than 14,000 children have been killed. That is simply outrageous, and it is completely unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those circumstances, it's important that people know the Australian government has been resolute in its efforts to influence an end to the violence by continuing to speak, act, vote, apply sanction measures and join with like-minded nations in pushing for a ceasefire at every opportunity. Alongside that persistent effort, the Australian government has contributed more than $70 million in humanitarian funding. But I completely understand that, as people see the bombing and suffering continue, their message to me and to all of us here is that that's not enough. I accept that message because, until the violence stops, all of us should be prepared to consider what more can be done to achieve a ceasefire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to everyone who is part of activism in the cause of peace and nonviolence. I'm grateful for the heartfelt commitment of the many groups and many more individuals who've reached out to me as part of that effort—the Perth Mums for Palestine, the Fremantle Palestine Group, Jews for Palestine, Doctors for Palestine, and the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, and more than 1,000 individuals. Activism in the cause of peace is vital, and it has long been a part of my life and has long been a focus for my community. Activism, as part of civil society engagement, is an expression of our values as a democratic society. We must remember that, by its nature, activism will not be neat and tidy. Indeed, often it will be robust and noisy and provocative. You can't be an activist in the cause of peace and nonviolence if your activism isn't undertaken in accordance with those values. All the groups I've mentioned have engaged with me wholeheartedly and stridently in pain and distress and frustration—which is completely understandable—but always peacefully and always with respect and in good faith. I honour that. Their input will always shape my work in this place.</span>

Last week, thousands of organisations rallied behind National Child Protection Week. For me as a dad, there is nothing more terrifying than the thought of something happening to one of my sons. For Bruce and Denise Morcombe, this fear became reality when their 13-year-old son, Daniel, was abducted and murdered. As many Australians know, Daniel was simply waiting at a bus stop in Queensland, on his way to buy Christmas presents for his family. Following this unthinkable day, Bruce and Denise, in the midst of their grief, saw an opportunity to make a difference. Together they started the Daniel Morcombe Foundation to educate other children on how to stay safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Child Protection Week is not only about responding to the current issue but also about proactively equipping children with the confidence to recognise and escape unsafe situations. For the last eight years, the Daniel Morcombe Foundation has helped keep kids safe through Australia's Biggest Child Safety Lesson initiative. This year's lesson was livestreamed across Australia from Manly State School in my electorate of Bonner. Australia's Biggest Safety Lesson provides an easy way for teachers, parents and carers to confidently discuss enthusiastic and affirmative consent. What does this mean? It means teaching our kids the importance of not crossing blurring boundaries and ensuring that consent is always truly, freely, clearly and wholeheartedly given. It was awesome to see this event livestreamed from Bonner to thousands of students across Australia. Thank you to our hosts, Coco and Finn, for keeping us informed and engaged. Remember: always ask for consent and wait for enthusiastic and affirmative confirmation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge David Crisafulli and the Queensland LNP opposition, who, yesterday, standing alongside Bruce and Denise, committed to establishing a public sex offender register. Named 'Daniel's Law', this register is a tangible step to making our community safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, thank you to Bruce and Denise for your continued advocacy and commitment to helping our kids stay safe. By teaching our young ones the skills needed to recognise, react to, and report unsafe situations, the Daniel Morcombe Foundation has not only become a powerful symbol of hope but also undoubtedly saved lives. While nothing will bring Daniel back, Bruce and Denise have courageously turned a tragedy into a powerful platform to raise awareness and bring change. It was an honour to be part of last week's Australia's Biggest Child Safety Lesson. I look forward to continuing to work with this driven team.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  Yesterday, I attended the 25th anniversary lunch of the Para District sub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association SA Branch, a sub-branch that I have been honoured to have been patron of since its inception in 1999. Between 1951 and 1972, some 287,000 young men were called up for compulsory training in the Australian Army, Air Force or Navy. Of them, more than 63,000 were conscripted into the regular Army and over 19,500 served in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Borneo and Vietnam. Of the 15,300 who served in Vietnam, sadly, 210 lost their lives, and another two were killed in active service in Borneo. As has been highlighted time and again, military service is life-changing for so many who serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's reports about the royal commission into veteran suicide that revealed there were more than 1,600 suicides of Defence veterans between 1997 and the year 2020 highlights that we must better support our veterans. The Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, currently before the parliament, is a welcome step that will simplify and harmonise the claims processing for veterans, which has been one of the real difficulties for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the years have passed, our Nashos are ageing, and too many have passed away. For many, their military service also took its toll on their wellbeing. All too often, their claims for support were rejected, and claims processing was very difficult and sometimes demoralising. But through their National Servicemen's Associations, they have often found the friendship, support and understanding that has helped them get through their own individual struggles. As someone who has been associated with them for the past 25 years, I have seen many of those struggles firsthand, and I have watched them age. Some of them are still trying to pursue claims that they initiated years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having attended their 25th anniversary luncheon yesterday, I once again saw them come together and support each other. I say thank you to the Nashos who have served our country. Thank you for your service to our nation. Thank you for supporting one another, particularly when you were going through difficult times in your lives, and thank you for the many friendships that I have personally made through this association. For me, it has been a privilege to have been associated with the Para District sub-branch for the past 25 years and to have been their patron.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country is run like an arm of the fossil fuel industry. When the fossil fuel industry says, 'Jump,' the major parties ask, 'How high?' For decades the fossil fuel industry and multinational mining corporations have taken this country for a ride. Their tax rates are among the lowest in the world, especially when compared with countries who have a similar economic make-up to Australia. Last year Australia's oil and gas industry paid a tad over $17 billion in taxes. That may sound like a lot of money, but let's compare that to Norway, another country that exports a lot of fossil fuels—namely, oil and gas. Norway imposes a corporation tax of 22 per cent on fossil fuel companies but then a further 56 per cent special tax on petroleum operations. This tax setup has been in place since 1996 and last year generated the country $127 billion in revenue. That is how we should be taxing the fossil fuel companies in this country, but instead they are operating on a model of environmental destruction and then asking us to not even tax them fairly for the pleasure of doing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's say we tax the fossil fuel industry fairly. Let's say the mining industry paid just a bit more than the nine per cent in royalties they've been paying in Queensland over the last 10 years while at the same time they exported $634 billion of resources. Let's say we fix the tax system so that teachers aren't paying more in taxes than the oil and gas industry does, which is not a made-up statistic, as research from the Australia Institute has shown us that this is what is happening right now. Let's say we fix it. What could we do with that revenue? We could dramatically improve people's lives and protect the climate. We could bring dental and mental health into Medicare, saving people hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in healthcare bills every single year. We could wipe all student debt and make university free once again, providing everyone in this country the chance to pursue higher education without fear of the cost or being left with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt. We could raise JobSeeker above the poverty line and move on a path towards making sure that no-one in this country ever has to live in poverty. We could invest in renewable energy and the transition to a green economy so that Australia can live up to its potential as the powerhouse of the world, with ample wind, solar, batteries and new and emerging green technologies. We could be a world leader in tackling climate change instead of playing catch-up to the rest of the world, as we always seem to do. We are robbing ourselves of countless economic and social opportunities because governments refuse to challenge the power of the fossil fuel industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot leave workers in the fossil fuel sector in the dust when this industry eventually ceases to exist, which it will. It is fundamental to a just transition to a renewable economy that workers in the fossil fuel sector are taken care of. We all have bills to pay, and these workers are no different. When we talk about a just transition, we need a job-for-job guarantee. A renewable economy still requires mining for critical minerals, and it is of fundamental importance that workers are centred in this transition. The climate crisis is caused by corporations, not by workers. We are running out of time to tackle the climate crisis and, the longer we leave it, the closer a large-scale rapid transition looms. We need a big plan that looks after workers and communities alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous industry collapses like steel in Newcastle and car manufacturing in Geelong and Adelaide have given us important insights into what we should avoid. Without transition plans in place at the time corporations announce plant closures, only a third of workers are able to find full-time employment again, another third can find only insecure work and the final third remain permanently unemployed. We cannot leave communities to face this alone. By making the fossil fuel industry finally pay their fair share of taxes, we could change this country immeasurably for the better. We could fund a just transition for workers, bring dental and mental health into Medicare, wipe student debt and lift countless people out of poverty. The only thing stopping us from achieving this goal is the cowardice of the major parties.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I want to start by giving the Greens a dose of reality that will be hard for them to swallow, so I apologise in advance for any sobbing or whingeing you may hear coming from them. The fact is that as long as people want to buy our coal we will continue to sell them our coal. I want the last piece of coal ever to burn to come from our mines in the Hunter Valley because it is the best, most efficient and highest quality coal in the world. There will be no abrupt or enforced transition away from coal. Here is another fact for you. The vast majority of coal that we mine in my electorate in the Hunter is exported. So, while it's true that the market is moving away from using coal to power our country and this government has done amazing work to make sure this is happening as smoothly as possible, even after our last coal-fired power station is closed in Australia our coal will still be mined and exported for decades and decades to come. We will mine it and we will sell it until the day there is no-one who wants to buy it. So you can put your unrealistic pipedreams of a rapid transition away from coal to bed because it is just as much of a fairytale as the coalition's nuclear policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, the member for Brisbane has moved a motion without actually doing his homework. If he had done his homework before getting all worked up about how much he despises the mining industry, he would know that the most recent budget reports that the resources sector contributed to two-fifths of the company tax in the 2022-23 financial year. He'd also know that the mining, energy and water sector is estimated to have contributed $42.4 billion in tax in the 2021-22 financial year. I think he really needs a reality check. Instead of demonising the industry, he needs to open his eyes and think about all the ways that we really do rely on the mining industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is fact No. 3. We can't move towards net zero without the mining industry. I hope the Greens political party are listening today, because there is much to learn here. Without mining there are no solar panels, wind turbines or batteries. I'd like to see the member for Brisbane try to build a wind turbine without traditional resources like iron. It's not just us that will be relying on mining our rich deposits and critical resources so we can power our future; countries around the world will be as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, every single person has a reason to be grateful for mining. Without mining we don't have the iron we need to build fridges, public transport or aircon. We won't have the copper we need for car brakes and plumbing. Without mining there is no gold for circuit boards, TVs and mobile phones and there's no aluminium for tinfoil hats or beer cans. That's right: if the member for Brisbane had his way, he would stop you from being able to crack open a few tins with your mates because he doesn't want us to be able to produce aluminium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member for Brisbane, I say: Don't be ungrateful. Go thank a miner in your electorate or thank all of the miners around Australia for what they do. Get out of your inner-city office and have a look at electorates like mine in the Hunter that make our country run. The fact is that we need mining. Everywhere you look, we rely on mining in some way. Even as we continue to make amazing progress on reducing our emissions, mining is going nowhere. Thank goodness for that, because look at what we gain from it. Mining powers our economy. The sector directly employs more than a quarter of a million Australians, many of these in my electorate in the Hunter. The mining industry also supports more than 1.1 million indirect jobs. Mining has made my electorate what it is. Almost everyone knows a miner or has a family member who has worked in the mines or knows someone who has connections in the mines. It has provided good-paying, secure employment for generations and is firmly part of the identity of the entire Hunter region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Greens can continue to hate on mining, but they live in a dream world if they think somehow they will convince us to rapidly transition away from mining. It's here to stay. The final fact of the day is that mining is definitely here to stay. I say to the miners in my electorate and all around Australia: thank you for the hard work you do, the long shifts and the time away from your families, friends and loved ones. Keep up the great work. We support you. We will continue to support you in the future. I look forward to continuing to see many of you in the Hunter but also around Australia as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hopefully the member for Brisbane can go and thank the miners in his electorate, because there are a lot there that do great, critical work for our country. I think you could go and say thank you to them, because mining matters. Thank you to all the miners in the Hunter. Cheers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  Big mining corporations are raking in obscene profits by selling off resources that belong to all Australians. What do we get back? Next to nothing. Over the last decade, mining giants have extracted $634 billion worth of Queensland's resources. You'd think that would mean well-funded hospitals, schools and public services, right? Wrong. These corporations have only paid nine per cent in royalties. That's crumbs compared to the billions they've pocketed. It gets worse. Ten of the biggest mining companies in Queensland pay zero corporate tax. These resources are ours. Mining companies pay royalties for the privilege to dig them up, but they do not own them. We do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at Norway. They collect 55 per cent of gas and petroleum revenues for Norwegians' benefit. Here in Australia we collect a measly three per cent. Even Texas, of all places, charges 25 per cent royalties on coal and gas. Qatar exports roughly the same amount of LNG that we do, and yet they collect six times more revenue than Australia. It's Robin Hood in reverse. The government lets these massive mining companies take our resources for basically nothing. These corporations hoard the profits, often in overseas companies. Take a look at our gas exports. Australians have missed out on $13 billion of royalty revenue in the last four years because the government gave it away for free. In terms of gas, we only collect royalties from the North West Shelf. All other offshore gas projects are free game. If you're mad, you should be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the kicker: right now schoolteachers are paying more in income tax than the entire oil and gas industry. In the last 10 years, Australian teachers have forked out an average of $9.5 billion a year in tax. What about the oil and gas industry? They've forked out a measly $4.6 billion in petroleum resource rent tax. The government pretends it can't afford to properly fund public education, but it's happy to squeeze the teachers while letting the richest and dirtiest corporations off the hook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia the government is giving massive mining companies a free ride while everyday Australians are expected to scrimp and save and break their backs to pay for the bare minimum, like dental care or university fees, which just keep climbing. In fact, the government collects more from HECS payments than it does from the PRRT. We have a system that demands that teachers, who are absolutely vital to our children's futures, pay thousands of dollars for their degrees, work for less than minimum wage during placements and then face underfunded and overcrowded schools. On top of all of that, their profession ends up paying more tax than the oil and gas industry—an industry that is actively harming our kids' futures. Make it make sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are subsidising the fossil fuel industry with their hard-earned tax dollars and they're getting nothing in return. In the last year, governments across Australia have handed out $14.5 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies. That's the equivalent of almost $30,000 of our money every minute of every day. It's time these corporations paid their fair share. In Queensland we can raise mining royalties to 35 per cent across the board. That could raise $61 billion over four years, even as we transition away from fossil fuels, to fund the future, to fund renewable energy and to fund the things that all Australians need to have a good life. Just stop giving handouts to mining corporations that squander our future, and, instead, fund public schools, fund GP and health clinics and fund social and affordable housing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past fortnight, we have watched in awe as Australians have competed to the highest level in the Paris Paralympic Games, in which 160 Australian Paralympians competed across 17 sports, 61 athletes making their debuts. Our Paralympians range in age from 15-year-old para-swimmer Holly Warn to 69-year-old Jimmy Huo in para-table-tennis. Behind each athlete is a story of determination and resilience, of support and sacrifice by family and supporters and of triumphs and disappointments. Members of the Australian Paralympic team won 63 medals. They have shone, and we heartily celebrate this excellence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to recognise each individual's journey, medal winner or not, and the support provided by their coaches, families, supporters and sports administrators—in other words, all the people who have provided that scaffolding in their lives. Here are some of their stories. Four women represented Australia in para-equestrian events. Stella Barton from Melbourne was the second Australian to ever compete in grade 1. Having ridden since the age of seven, Stella was ready to retire; however, in a sliding doors moment on her final farewell ride, internationally renowned coach Mary Longden convinced Stella to team up with coach Sally Francis and chase national selection. At Versailles, Stella competed magnificently to finish seventh in the grade 1 freestyle equestrian. Congratulations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a star-studded para-cycling team, including South Australia's Meg Lemon. Meg was working as a clinical dietician in rural communities when at age 25 she was hit by a car while riding her bike to work. The accident left her with a permanent brain injury and significantly weakened the right side of her body. During rehab, para-cycling gave Meg a new sense of purpose, and she won bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics. In the lead-up to Paris, Meg resparked her passion in nutrition and has been working as a dietician at the South Australian Sports Institute. In Paris, Meg won a silver medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Co-captain of the Australian team and Queenslander Curtis McGrath was serving as an Australian Army combat engineer in Afghanistan in 2012 when he stepped on an explosive device and lost his right leg above the knee and left leg below the knee, so he is a bilateral amputee. He vowed that when he recovered he would represent his country at the Paralympic Games. By 2014, he was world champion and has become a multiple Paralympic gold medallist and a para-canoe legend. He added more gold in Paris—what a legend!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have large and successful para-athletics and swimming squads, and it has been exciting to see Australian Paralympians in sports as diverse as archery, rowing and judo, not to mention our wheelchair basketball and rugby gladiators, the Rollers and the Steelers. My particular congratulations to our Higgins Paralympians: swimmer Col Pearse, who won silver; 1,500-metre runner Reece Langdon, who won bronze; and triathlete Liam Twomey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support from government and the AIS has also helped. The AIS has partnered with Paralympics Australia, national sporting organisations and the National Institute Network to focus on overcoming a range of barriers and building a sustainable future for para-sport in Australia. The sector is united to ensure that para-athletes are integrated into broader sports planning and that the system evolves to meet their needs. Strengthening the support offered to current para-coaches and identifying and developing coaches of the future is another key focus for improvement. Medal winners at the Paris Paralympics will receive payments from the Australian government at parity with successful athletes in the Olympics, a welcome development indeed. Congratulations and thank you to all our Paralympians and all who support you. You have thrilled and inspired us over the last fortnight.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  Australia has a proud history at the Paralympics. Since the first games in 1960—to which Australia sent 12 athletes, winning a total of 10 medals—Australia has always punched above its weight in the Olympics and Paralympics together. This year, 4,000 Paralympians travelled to Paris, where Australia was represented by 160 athletes: 152 with an impairment, two athletic guides, two boccia ramp operators, two cycling pilots, one triathlon guide and one rowing coxswain. They were supported by 198 staff, including two handlers for a triathlon. Our youngest athlete is 15 and our oldest athlete is approaching 70. Sixty-one of these athletes made their Paralympian debut this year for Australia. We had another characteristically strong showing, with 18 gold medals and 63 medals overall, for a ninth-place finish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate each participant on their participation in these games. I personally watched a lot of the competition and found it to be inspiring, particularly those who have overcome health and mental challenges to perform at an elite level. The opportunity for people to use sport to overcome differences and a great display of the power of sport to connect and grow people through competition were on display over these last couple of weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly inspired to watch, and am particularly grateful in congratulating, Cronulla local and Paralympics legend Dan Michel. Dan won a silver medal in Paris. Dan, you made all of us proud in your finals appearance last Tuesday morning, winning your second Paralympic medal—a silver medal—in the final against South Korea. I would also like to give a shout-out to Dan's ramp assistant, Ashlee Maddern. Dan has represented Australia on more than 25 occasions, and these were his third Paralympics. On Dan's arm a tattoo reads, 'Much effort, much prosperity.' The effort Dan has put into this sport since the age of 16 demonstrates the truth of this tattoo. He entered the games for Australia in the unprecedented position of being world No. 1 in the BC3 individual and, paired with Jamieson Leeson, world No. 1 in the BC3 pairs. Dan claimed Australia's first individual medal in boccia in 25 years, securing the bronze in Tokyo, and he has followed that up with a stunning performance to secure the silver for Australia in Paris. As a duo in the boccia doubles, Dan and his partner, Jamie, go by the nickname Dan and Jam, and, along with their ramp operators, received the award for Team of the Year at the 2023 AIS Sport Performance Awards, the first Paralympic team to ever win this award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dan, you've done exceptionally well, and you make everybody in our electorate of Cook proud. I'd like to congratulate you on your recent silver medal and being an inspiration to us all. You've shown us that sports are a great way for people living with a disability to participate. Forty-one per cent of Australians participate in sports at least once a week. This is in stark contrast to Australians with a disability, of whom only 24 per cent participate in sport weekly. Participation is important for not only physical but also mental and social wellbeing for Australians, and we do not want to freeze out Australians living with a disability from these mental and social improvement opportunities. I encourage people living with a disability to follow the example of Dan and to consider sport and what it can do for them physically, mentally and socially. I think we need to look to the NDIS and other government support programs to help people with a disability improve their participation in sport so that it starts approaching that of ordinary, average Australians. Role models like Dan and the other Paralympians are critical to further improving these participation rates. I welcome their leadership.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I rise today, full of pride as an Australian, to congratulate our amazing Paralympic team, who have just competed at the 2024 Paris Paralympics. These remarkable athletes have once again shown the world the true spirit of determination, resilience and excellence that defines our nation. With the closing ceremony taking place overnight, marking the end to the games, our Paralympians are returning home with 63 medals, including 18 gold, 17 silver and 28 bronze. But, medal or no medal, all of our athletes wearing the green and gold have done our nation proud. From the moment the Paralympic flame was lit, our team have embodied the very best of what it means to be Australian. They have faced challenges with unwavering courage and have inspired us all with their commitment to pushing the limits of what is possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a few Canberra locals amongst the winners. For Canberra, we saw adopted local Vanessa Low win gold in the T61 long jump. She did it in style too, breaking her own world record in the process. We saw Australia's mixed medley team win an incredible gold. Canberran Jesse Aungles was joined by Timothy Hodge, Emily Beecroft and Alexa Leary in the final, with Keira Stephens and Callum Simpson playing crucial roles in the heats. We saw 18-year-old Alex Saffy, a proud product of the AIS right here in Canberra, win his first-ever Paralympic medal in the 100-metre S10 butterfly. These incredible achievements are not just about medals; they are about the stories behind each athlete and their journey. They are about overcoming adversity, defying the odds and showing the world what athletes with a disability can achieve. I also want to acknowledge the support teams—the coaches, families and friends who have stood by our athletes every step of the way. Their encouragement and dedication have been instrumental in these successes, and we owe them our gratitude as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians love our sport, and we love our para-athletes. I'm so proud to be a member of a government that is investing in our Paralympians. In June, I stood beside the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sport to announce that the Albanese government was doubling the funding for para-sports. The $54.9 million in additional funding is the biggest ever Paralympics spend by an Australian government. In August, Minister Wells announced that, for the first time, the Australian government would provide para-athletes with the same financial incentives for winning medals as Olympians. Gold medallists will receive $20,000, silver medallists will receive $15,000, and bronze medallists will receive $10,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paris 2024 Paralympics will be remembered not just for the broken records and the medals won but for the moments that have united us all in pride and admiration for our athletes. To our Paralympians: thank you for representing Australia with such distinction. You are true champions—not just in sport, but in life—and you're an inspiration to us all. Just like our Olympians a few weeks before, you've inspired the nation and made us so proud to be Australian. Thank you, Paralympians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Overnight, the 2024 Paris Paralympics closed, and what an 11 days of celebrating our Paralympians and people across the world it was. We had 150 para-athletes competing, and they did us proud. The one thing that I found really invigorating when I watched the Paralympics was the fact that there were massive, raucous crowds there. When the swimming was on, there wasn't a seat to be had in the place, and the athletes competed in front of crowds that were 70,000 people and more. It was wonderful to see. It was a time of 11 days of stories, where people's lifetimes of hard work, endeavour and dreams came to fruition. We know it's so much more than winning medals; it's that sense of endeavour, aspiration and self-worth that comes with doing what you can in your life, committing and dedicating yourself, having a dream and trying to make it come true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I'd read out some quotes today from athletes from across the world who competed in the Paralympics. One is from one of our own Paralympians, Tim Hodge, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Olympics are the epitome of human excellence and the Paralympics are the epitome of human resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to read out a few more quotes because these athletes inspire us all. Yang Yue from China, who claimed the gold medal in the women's F64 discus, shared an important message to her daughter:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I want to tell my daughter this: it pays to persevere. If you persevere for long enough, your dreams may just come true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was Ezra Frech from the USA, who won two gold medals in the para-athletics. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I believe I was put here on this earth to normalise disability, change perceptions about what is possible as an amputee, winning back-to-back golds, leading the Paralympic movement until 2028. That's why it was written. The universe gave me the script and all I had to do was this, this and this was going to happen tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hannah Cockroft, following her win in the women's 100 metres T34, had a heartwarming moment that reminded her of the impact of her legacy. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the call room this morning someone told me, 'I watched you in 2012 and that's why I am here today.' I really hope there are some girls at home who are doing the same because that's what it's all about. Hopefully, today, some new dreams have been born.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was Zakia. She became the first ever medallist for the refugee Paralympic team. She used her platform to send a powerful message:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Afghanistan is my country, and today the Taliban are in power in my country. It's important to me to show strength to the Afghan women and girls around the world. I've worked hard for that, to show them the medal. I hope the world does not forget the women and girls of Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One last one I'll mention is Ali Truwit from the USA, who lost her leg in a life-threatening shark attack in 2023. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I was faced with a life-changing trauma, I worked to see the positive and focus on gratitude and let that carry me. When you are truly faced with death and you understand what a second chance at life means, you want to make the most of it. So, I have worked to do that and it's not without an incredible, incredible support system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can see that the Paralympics are far more than just a competition. They represent what it is to be human, what it is to have human resilience and what it is to show dedication and commitment and overcome adversity. I congratulate and thank every single athlete who was at those Paralympic Games and all those who aspire to be there and aspire to be at the Olympics in the future. Congratulations and thank you.</span>

The performances have been extraordinary and the results are 18 gold medals, 17 silver medals and 28 bronze medals. Obviously every medal is inspirational and a personal triumph, but there have been 160 heroic tales, many before they got onto the track or into the pool in Paris.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the greats of the past, like Kurt Fearnley, Dylan Alcott and Louise Savage, we now have new household names: Madison de Rozario, Alexa Leary, Lauren Parker and Vanessa Low. That's just a snapshot of some of our new superstars. I love that phrase: you can't be what you can't see. I'm sure that there are hundreds of children across the country who are now dreaming of their own athletic journeys. Maybe some of them we will see competing in Brisbane in 2032. As the Prime Minister said to the para-athletes at the launch of the Paralympic team here in Parliament House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The impact that you'll have isn't just while the race is on, or the tournament or the event, it is ongoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There will be young boys and girls watching you who'll think to themselves 'I can do that'. In doing so, you lift not just them up, you lift the entire nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two things struck me at that launch: the athletes' palpable pride and the affirmation of the Paralympics Australia president, Alison Creagh, who is on the board of the Brisbane Olympic Games with me. Alison detailed the impact the athletes would have, should have and, we now know, did have. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… winning medals is just one part of the job. For Paralympic athletes, there is a broader context. Paralympic sport has the power to profoundly change lives and to enrich our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It does this by breaking down stereotypes around disability, confronting discrimination and demonstrating the power of diversity and inclusion. It inspires all Australians—with or without a disability—to apply our best selves to all our endeavours in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In this way, Paralympic sport is not just important for people who live with disability, it has a unique way of speaking to a far wider audience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words are very true. We've all been inspired by the indomitable spirit, courage and dedication these athletes have shown—not only during the games but in the years of training leading up to their events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government is a proud supporter of this team. On the day before the Paris games began, the Albanese government announced that our para-athletes would receive the same financial rewards at the 2024 games as the Australian Olympians. That means that Paralympian gold medallists have received $20,000, silver medallists $15,000 and bronze medallists $10,000. This is a just and necessary step. Equity: if you can see it, you can be it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a well-deserved break, I know the para-athletes will be looking forward to both Los Angeles in four years time and Brisbane in 2032, in less than eight years time. And I say, in a completely unbiased way, that I know the Brisbane games will be the best Paralympic and Olympic Games that the universe has ever seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has directed nearly $55 million—the biggest investment ever by an Australia government—to address systemic and structural performance barriers for para-athletes. This is part of the drive for 2032, called <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ustralia's</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> high performance </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2032+ sport</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> strategy</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> The Australian Institute of Sport has led a review to identify and better understand the barriers to entry and progression of para sport. These include systemic, attitudinal, policy, environmental and technical issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To combat these barriers, multisport para hubs will be established in each state to provide enhanced pathways and support systems for athletes and coaches. The hubs will enable access to fit-for-purpose equipment, to support athletes if they move to a different sport and, crucially, to lead to a coordinated and connected national classification system—and I know the University of Queensland is doing some great work there. This initiative is also supported by the nearly $250 million upgrade to the Australian Institute of Sport here in Canberra—so many opportunities in front of us.</span>

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  It has been such an inspiration to watch our incredible Paralympians represent our nation in Paris over the past fortnight. There were 4,400 athletes from around the world competing in 549 medal events across 22 sports. The Australian Paralympic team returns home with an amazing 63 medal wins, made up of 18 gold, 17 silver, and 28 bronze.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paralympics have a special place in our hearts. They represent all that is great about our proud sporting nation. They remind us of the ability sport has to inspire, to motivate and to bring out the best in all of us, and they show what is possible when you dream and dedicate yourself to a goal, despite the challenges you may face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Casey electorate has been represented by Healesville local Bridget Murphy, who is competing in the para dressage with her horse, Macey. Bridget is part of an all-female equestrian team and made her Paralympic debut in the grade 2 category—something she has dreamt of since she began riding as a child. Bridget developed her riding skills with the Yarra Valley Equestrian and Mount Evelyn Pony Club and was training at least twice a week with her coach, Monica, in the lead-up to the games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing Bridget on our screens was a very proud moment for the Yarra Valley, with her whole team based in our community. They live in the Yarra Valley, her horse, Macey, was bred in the Yarra Valley and her coach is from Coldstream. It's so important to remember, as we celebrate these athletes, that there is always a dedicated team behind them—coaches, trainers and support staff who work tirelessly to ensure our athletes have the best possible chance to succeed. Next to their support staff is their families and friends. I don't think that there could be a prouder moment for a parent—for Bridget's parents, but all parents of our para-athletes—than watching their children compete. We should celebrate our athletes and celebrate their families. We all know that so many of the families sacrifice so much as their children are growing up—time and money—so they can chase their dreams. It's a huge honour for Bridget but also a huge honour for her family and her friends who have been following her journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridget competed in a test on Wednesday evening, and she was then chosen as one of three riders to represent Australia in the team event on Friday evening, alongside Lisa Martin and Stella Barton. She completed her time at the games in the individual freestyle event on Saturday evening. Congratulations, Bridget, on representing Australia and our Yarra Valley at the Paralympics. You earned your place through your dedication and talent. You have made our nation so proud. I'm so looking forward to catching up with you when you are back home, on home soil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all of our Australian Paralympic heroes. You have inspired a nation, and you've inspired many Australians. I have no doubt that, as we look forward to 2026, there will be some young Australians with some physical challenges that will have seen the Paralympic athletes compete in the last two weeks, and they'll be inspired to compete in 2026. They give hope to the next generation to compete at the Paralympics. That is what we need to continue to build as a society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been lucky enough to play sport my whole life—nowhere near this level, I would say. What I know about sport is that it brings people together. It brings community together, and we need to celebrate. We can sometimes take for granted the journey we've gone on as a society, but we need to celebrate today that every Australian, regardless of their abilities, how they were born or the challenges they've faced, is able to enjoy sport at a community level, at a national level and at a Paralympic level. That is something we should be proud of as a country.</span>

In Wide Bay this year, there have been 14 fatalities on our section of the Bruce Highway between Gympie and Maryborough. At Bororen, we've seen the chaos, mayhem and massive disruption following a tragic, fatal crash that cut the highway for five days. It's obvious how much work still needs to be done to make the Bruce Highway safer from Gympie going north, but this work has become much harder due to the Albanese Labor government's decision to cut funding to National Highway projects from 80 per cent to fifty-fifty with the states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister claims to have driven every inch of the Bruce Highway and says, 'You can't build a road with a media release; you need to build it with dollars and workers and a plan to get it done.' He's right, but only offering 50 per cent of that cost will never get it done. The only way state governments will be able to afford projects like the Gympie bypass is if funding arrangements go back to the way they were under the coalition. The coalition delivered 80 per cent of the bypass costs by contributing over $1.2 billion for sections C and D of the Cooroy-to-Curra upgrade, compared to Labor's $655 million contribution to sections A and B. It's important to note that, when he was federal transport minister, Prime Minister Albanese funded section B because the then state Labor government had planned to flood eight kilometres of the old Bruce Highway with its failed Traveston Crossing Dam, and he only agreed to fund section A because the state LNP government wanted it done and offered 50 per cent of the project's cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RACQ has found that 1,400 kilometres of the Bruce Highway between Gympie and Cairns is undivided, with large parts rated at two stars, out of a five-star safety rating, and that those travelling on the same stretch of highway are five times more likely to be killed than those driving between Sydney and Melbourne. This is truly appalling. The government must restore its 80 per cent funding share and work with the Queensland government to prioritise and fast-track projects to make the highway from Gympie to Cairns as safe as it is from Gympie to Melbourne. No-one can afford the years of procrastination and delay that this government will cause with its funding cuts, which not only increase risk but guarantee tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have personally seen what a difference an upgraded, world-class, four-lane, divided highway makes. In Wide Bay, from Cooroy to Gympie, we have that road. As I said, that's partially a result of the Labor government, but it's predominantly a result of the coalition government. I worked as an accident investigator on the old highway, and I saw what happened. I dealt with it and delivered those terrible messages to the families of the people who were tragically killed on that road. This is a serious matter. This is infrastructure that the government provides to the people of Queensland. This is infrastructure that is killing the people of Queensland, and we need to do better. Everyone needs to do better. State, federal, Labor and coalition—we all need to do better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for bringing this motion forward. The National Highway in Queensland, better known to Queenslanders as 'the Bruce', is often in the news for all the wrong reasons. It's not uncommon to hear of the road being cut due to flooding or even a landslip during the Queensland summer, or after a weather event. Lately there have been way too many headlines regarding devastating road accidents on the Bruce. These accidents are tragic, and I send my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives or were seriously harmed in these recent accidents. I give a special shout-out to the police—like the member for Wide Bay, in his former profession—the ambos, the firies and other workers who respond to such carnage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government stands behind our Vision Zero program—that is, zero deaths and zero injuries due to road accidents by 2050. The Office of Road Safety coordinates federal, state/territory and local government efforts that work towards this goal. To quote the Vision Zero principle:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This means creating a system where the system designers and operators, including engineers, planners, lawmakers, enforcement agencies, post trauma crash care workers and others—share responsibility with road users for designing a road system that does not allow human error to have a serious or fatal outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt this would be beneficial to the hundreds of thousands of drivers on the Bruce Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife is from Cairns. I used to teach up near Cairns. I used to be a union organiser who covered the area from Rockhampton up to Moranbah. So I've driven the Bruce way too many times, and I know that the Bruce Highway will benefit from the Albanese government's investment of over $10 billion directed towards safety improvements, including the $1.35 billion Bruce Highway Safety Package. That includes widening high-priority sections of pavement for wide centre line treatment, installing barriers at high-priority locations, installing safety barriers at high-risk sites and implementing improvements to signage and lines. Reflecting the heavy usage of the road, there are also plans to increase the capacity of this important corridor. I note that the Gympie Bypass is about to open, I think, next week or the week after. I look forward to that, as someone who's got a sister who lives in Gympie. The substantial investment in Bruce Highway improvements was continued in the last budget. An extra $467 million was directed to the highway, including an additional $154 million for improvements along the Bruce Highway North Corridor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Queenslanders, members of the most decentralised state, we know that there's a focus on the safety of the Bruce Highway. As a result, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has written to her Queensland counterpart to request that the state government expedite these proposals to accelerate these crucial safety works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has a proven record of commitment to road safety and, within that, a focus on improving the safety of regional roads. We've doubled the Roads to Recovery funding, from $500 million to $1 billion annually. The resulting projects, which support the construction and maintenance of local road infrastructure assets, are delivered by local governments, obviously sometimes by their employees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding for the Black Spot Program is also progressively increasing from $110 million  to $150 million per year. This program directly targets dangerous and risky locations where crashes are occurring. It funds improvements, such as traffic signals or roundabouts, to help reduce the risks of crashes. This is driven by data, not by colour coded spreadsheets. That's important, because the LNP don't know. Obviously, they're yepping from Yeppoon and are addicted to pork. So it's good to get the data driving what's going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's more funding for the Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program. That will increase to $200 million annually. We've introduced the National Road Safety Action Grants Program. We've also committed $16.5 million to the car safety ratings program over the next five years. This enables independent vehicles and safety assessments for both new and used vehicles, giving the customers important data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all these proactive measures, those opposite don't think that a $10 billion federal investment in the Bruce is sufficient. They're focused on the 80-20 split with the Queensland government. This is despite the conclusion drawn by the independent review of the Infrastructure Investment Program that recommended a fifty-fifty split. Our commitment is to shared accountability and investment maximisation. The government's investment of more than $10 billion in the Bruce is only worth $12 billion on an 80-20 split. However, if we do the fifty-fifty, we end up having about $20 billion to invest in the safety of Queenslanders and all Australians, and that's a good thing for the Bruce and for the nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  Queenslanders are no strangers to the dangers of the Bruce Highway. Research from the RACQ should send shockwaves through this parliament. It reveals that motorists travelling on the Bruce Highway between Gympie and Cairns are five times more likely to be injured or killed in a car crash than those driving on the Hume Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bruce Highway, at 1,679 kilometres long, is the backbone of Queensland, connecting every major city from Brisbane to Cairns. It carries essential freight, keeps businesses moving and underpins our economy, particularly in regional areas. Yet it is fast becoming known for its deadly toll. In my electorate of Capricornia, the statistics on the Bruce Highway are nothing short of alarming. There are only two overtaking lanes for every 100 kilometres, 31 narrow bridges and over 230 road defects. It is no wonder this stretch of road has some of the highest rates of fatal and serious injuries in this country. The most concerning section, between Sarina and Mackay, has an average of 9.9 fatal and serious injury crashes every 100 kilometres. These aren't just statistics. It is a devastating reality for too many families across our great state. Every year lives are shattered, dreams are cut short and communities are left grieving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just a matter of weeks, the Bruce Highway has become the scene of some of its most devastating tragedies. Four serious crashes have claimed three lives in just three weeks. Among the victims were Dioneto Pereira de Souza, a 29-year-old Rockhampton man who had just become a father for the first time; Scott Cassidy, a 50-year-old father of six from Townsville; and a 21-year-old Rockhampton man whose life was cut short in a horrific highway explosion. Recently I had the privilege of speaking with Leyland Barnett, who is a Rockhampton constituent and a dedicated safety advocate. Leyland's 21-year-old niece, Emily, tragically lost her life in a head-on collision on the Bruce Highway, caused by dangerous roads—a day that, as Leyland describes, their family will never forget. These people, like so many others, are not just statistics. They were everyday Queenslanders much like you and me. They woke up in the morning and got behind the wheel and set out on the Bruce Highway for work or travel, never imagining they wouldn't return home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queenslanders are crying out for action, but, instead of delivering the funding to fix this critical artery, Labor has failed to meet the urgent needs of our communities. Those opposite made a devastating decision, cutting the funding model for the Bruce Highway from an 80-20 contribution to a mere 50-50. This reckless change will not just delay the critical upgrades that this dangerous highway desperately needs; it will likely cancel them altogether. The consequences of this funding cut are real. Without the necessary financial backing, essential upgrades will be postponed or scrapped altogether. Every day that these upgrades are delayed, more lives at risk. We are not talking about abstract figures here; we are talking about real Queenslanders who may never make it home because this government has chosen to balance the books at the cost of human lives. Far too many families are losing loved ones on our roads, yet Labor is cutting critical road funding and failing to assist councils to make these safety improvement to local roads. It's shameful for the minister for infrastructure to claim credit for road safety funding in a cynical attempt to distract from the rising fatalities on our roads throughout Labor's term in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of the track record of investment which I have delivered for the Bruce. Unlike Labor, I know what improving roads does for communities. This includes $106.4 million for black spot areas, $72.6 million for maintenance funding, $126.4 million to upgrade the northern access to Rockhampton and $11.5 million to improve the highway in north Sarina. This investment was made possible because the coalition government believed that investing in roads was investing in lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in Capricornia are also not seeing a return on the wealth they create to improve the roads in our region. In the 2022-23 financial year, the Fitzroy region alone contributed $18.1 billion in royalties generated by the hard work of local miners. This substantial revenue was funnelled into Treasury, only to cover cost blowouts on projects in metropolitan areas. Labor are letting the Bruce fall into disrepair to fund city developments, and it is costing lives. We owe it to the memory of those who have lost their lives on the Bruce, and to every person who continues to travel this highway, to acknowledge that human cost of inaction. These are not isolated incidents; they are a part of a growing pattern of tragedy that we cannot afford to ignore. I call on this government to restore the former government's 80 per cent funding share of projects to allow for urgent upgrades to be made.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accidents that occur on our national highway, the Bruce Highway—'the Bruce', as the member for Moreton  and other Queenslanders call it—in recent weeks are tragedies, and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those impacted and with the Queensland police and other emergency service personnel who attend these crashes. Every death on a road is one too many. However, the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads' own safety data shows that the Bruce Highway is getting safer as upgrades are completed, and the rate of fatality or serious crashes per 100 kilometres travelled dropped from 14.7 to 11.2 recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want to see more and better road safety on the Bruce. It's absolutely vital for Queensland, and it takes the collective efforts of every level of government to reduce the road toll. I can assure the member for Wide Bay that the Albanese government is working closely with the Queensland government. The Prime Minister has spoken with the Premier about this, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Catherine King, has asked the responsible minister in the Queensland government, Bart Mellish, to bring forward projects. The Queensland government needs to know. It needs to step up in relation to safety projects and safety works. Future priorities are critical. We need to hear from the Queensland government in relation to that. It needs to identify what the priority projects are and work with local government to get support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm Chair of the Queensland Black Spot Consultative Panel and I know that road safety is a high priority for the Albanese government. We're working to make improvements. We're investing record amounts of money in the Bruce Highway, with $10 billion for the highway as part of our more than $20 billion contribution to infrastructure in Queensland, including $1.35 billion for the Bruce Highway safety package. In the last budget, we invested $467 million in the Bruce Highway, including an additional $154 million for improvements along the northern corridor of the Bruce Highway. This builds on our record during the previous federal Labor government, when we boosted investment in the Bruce Highway to $7.6 billion in six years, compared to only $1.3 billion over the 11 years of the Howard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also accelerating projects along the highway. We recently finished the Cooroy to Curra Bruce Highway upgrade in the member for Wide Bay's own electorate. This was something that started under the Rudd government but was left to languish for a long time under the coalition. We got shovel-ready, and then they wanted to down tools. To the member's credit—and I'll give him credit—he convinced his coalition government colleagues at the time to speed up the delivery of the project, and now it has finally been completed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government takes road safety very seriously. It's a top priority to improve regional roads. We've backed this in with a record amount of funding for the Black Spot Program and $200 million for the new Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program. We've doubled the Roads to Recovery funding from $500 million to $1 billion per year, on top of the bilateral funding that we're delivering. In addition, we've created the new National Road Safety Action Plan Grants Program, providing grant funding to program initiatives that assist in delivering our commitment to Vision Zero. We're working with states and territories to develop a shared set of nationally consistent road safety data and recently finalised the intergovernmental road safety data sharing agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls on the government to restore the former government's 80 per cent funding share of projects for the Bruce Highway. What beggars belief here is that we're not actually reducing funding; we're just calling on the states and territories to increase their share of funding, consistent with last year's independent review of the infrastructure investment program. So it's a bit disingenuous for those opposite to claim we're reducing funding, particularly as they had an appalling record on infrastructure delivery, with more press releases than roads getting rolled out. In addition, we've given more than six times the funding of the previous Howard government on the Bruce Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Returning to a fifty-fifty funding split was recommended last year by the review. I'll give you an illustration of that in my own electorate. If we had adopted the 80-20 model, when it came to the Warrego Highway and the alternative upgrade to the Mount Crosby interchange on the Warrego Highway in Ipswich, instead of getting $138.5 million from the Queensland government, we would have got only $35 million— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  I rise today as a matter of urgency to support the member for Wide Bay's motion. The Bruce Highway is the lifeline for countless individuals and families across my electorate of Dawson. This vital artery is more than just a road. It connects us to our jobs, our schools and our loved ones. It's how our farmers deliver fresh food to our tables, how truck drivers keep our economy moving and how miners contribute to our shared prosperity. Yet, while the Bruce Highway serves as a crucial conduit for our livelihoods, it is simultaneously the site of horrific and avoidable tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics speak for themselves. Analysts from the Australian Road Assessment Program, conducted by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland, have revealed a chilling truth. Motorists travelling on the Bruce Highway are five times more likely to be injured or killed in a crash than those driving between Sydney and Melbourne. They are five times more likely to be injured or killed, just for living in regional Australia instead of a capital city. This is an alarming disparity that cannot continue to be ignored by those on the other side of the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The section of the Bruce that runs through Dawson, from Mackay all the way up to Townsville, has been identified as the most dangerous section of the highway. Out of a five-star rating system, more than half of this section of road has a safety rating of two stars or less. Just over a month ago, I launched a petition to back our Bruce, which now has over 1,000 signatures and testimonials from people who have experienced the devastation of the Bruce firsthand. That's 1,000 signatures, and they are still flooding in—1,000 stories, 1,000 more reasons why we have to act now to fix our Bruce Highway. Is 1,000 Australian lives not enough for the Albanese Labor government to care?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both aspects of this verse are true, but I'm less concerned with the speech about the oxen than I am about labourers and workers. In fairness, St Paul was probably referring to those who work for the gospel, but the principle still applies—that is, that workers who are owed their wages deserve them and have worked hard for them. They are not a gift from the boss, although the unconscionable number of wage theft cases may have you thinking otherwise. </span>

                  </a>  The government's 'right to disconnect' laws recognise this and are one way to help workers from undue expectations and pressures after work. Australians deserve not only their wages but a right to a living wage—that is, a wage that allows them to keep pace with the cost of living. It's no secret that the cost of living has made life incredibly tough and challenging for many Australians. This, coupled with flatlined wages growth, has created the perfect storm for millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By any assessment of their last term in office, the opposition and their colleagues showed that they had no regard whatsoever for the real wages of Australians. They were content to let business profits and the pays of executives soar while those on basic wages struggled. Thankfully, with the election of the Albanese government, those days have ended. This government understands the struggles of paying for the weekly shop, the rising cost of utility bills, the price of a tank of petrol and the cost of school shoes. That's why we introduced the fairer tax cuts, especially targeted at those on modest wages, and that's why we've given every Australian household $300 towards their electricity bills. We've also introduced 60-day scripts and have frozen the cost of those scripts for the next 12 months.</span>

                  </a>  But we have actually gone further than this, delivering real wages growth for working Australians. I'm proud that this government's workplace policies are getting wages moving again, with annual wages growing for the past three consecutive quarters. Indeed, nominal wages growth is 4.1 per cent in the year to the June quarter 2024, while annual real wages grew by 0.3 per cent through the year to the June quarter 2024. This result comes off the back of inheriting real wage decline of 3.4 per cent at the time of the election. That figure is a shameful indictment of those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the Albanese Labor government has unashamedly advocated for the wages of Australia's lowest paid, in three consecutive submissions to the annual wage review, ensuring that real wages of low-paid workers do not go backwards. In relation to some of the most vulnerable and underpaid, we've gone even further—much further. We've supported pay rises for aged-care workers of up to 28 per cent and a 15 per cent pay rise for early childhood education and care workers, delivering wage justice for these vital workforces. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is about choices, and it's also about priorities. Underpinning this is a government that is fundamentally about values, because those shape your choices and priorities. This government unashamedly values the work of everyday Australians, whatever workplace environment they find themselves in, and this government unashamedly values the right to a proper wage, a living wage, that moves and grows over time in a manner that allows people to pay for life's necessities and a few of life's other things. Of course, there's still much more to do to undress what has been done and what needs to be done for the pressures of everyday Australians. The real movement in wages of working Australians under this government is a good step, because all workers—from the time of Saint Paul to now—need to enjoy the benefits of their labour. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  It must be a Monday in parliament, because we've another motion from the government patting themselves on the back, telling the Australian people how lucky they are and how they've never had it better. Every week I get to stand up and have the opportunity to actually share what's happening with the challenges of the community, although I was a little confused when this motion came through, because it spoke about nominal real wages. I've spent a bit of time in business, did a degree and know a little bit about economics. I'd never heard the term 'nominal real wages'. The reason I'd never heard that term is that it doesn't exist. 'Nominal real wages' is not actually a term that's used, because nominal wages looks at total wages and how they've increased. They might have increased 4.1 per cent in the year to the June quarter. But real wages looks at your nominal wages, includes inflation and then works out, on those statistics: 'Are you going forward? Are you going backward?' I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the member for Werriwa. I don't know whether she wrote this motion herself. Many times, ministers will write them and people will sign them. Potentially, the Treasurer and his department think that 'nominal real wages' are a new term we are going to look at. Maybe it's an honest mistake. I'd be concerned if the Treasurer doesn't know the difference. Potentially, he is looking to spin and he has put 'real' in there because many people talk about 'real wages' and think that that's what they take home. I'll let the Treasurer inform us of whether that's an honest mistake and he's not across the economic detail or if he's deliberately trying to provide a little bit of spin for us.</span>

One statistic they didn't want to put in, another important measure of how the Australian people are going, is disposable income. They don't like talking about real disposable income. The real household disposable income fell two per cent over the year on a per capita basis.</span>

                  </a>  From March 2022 to June 2024, real disposable income fell 8.7 per cent on a per capita basis. That per capita basis is crucial, because that is what everyone is feeling in the community of Casey and all across the country. That's the actual number of what they're feeling. While real wages are important at the macro level—obviously migration and other factors show that—at the micro level, households are struggling and they know that. They know that because everything is going up. Health is up 11 per cent since the election; education is up 11 per cent; food is up 12 per cent; electricity is up 14 per cent, even after the rebates; housing is up 15 per cent; rent is up 16 per cent; financial and insurance costs are up 17 per cent; and gas is up 33 per cent. Yet the government, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister pat themselves on the back and tell us that we've never had it better. As we go through this motion—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  There were 249,179 small businesses across regional Australia as at 30 June 2023. That is a big number—a quarter of a million small businesses—and that's just in New South Wales. We know that right across the country small business absolutely dominates the economic landscape, because it is in small businesses where they employ most of the private sector. Most of the people paying tax receipts are employed by small businesses. Small-business owners and operators, we have to applaud them. We have to thank them because they are the ones who pay their workers first and who often go without. They go without pay in many instances. They go without holidays. They make sure that the lifeblood of the Australian economy endures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that across my Riverina electorate—and all politics is local—the Riverina small businesses absolutely dominate. Indeed, they contribute these gross domestic products. It's $739 million by Bland Shire, centred on West Wyalong. Take the figure for Coolamon; it's a quarter of a billion dollars. In the Cootamundra and Gundagai region it's $833 million. In Junee it's $464 million. There's $234 million contributed by Lockhart, and so on and so forth. In Temora it's $549 million. Then we come to Wagga Wagga and it's $6.8 billion. They are big figures. Indeed, what we should be doing is enhancing small business, not hampering it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that the Labor government has constricted and constrained small business by its policies, by making sure that, for instance, the instant asset tax write-off is limited. I know this was increased ever so slightly in the last budget, but it was far higher under a coalition government. What small businesses were able to do, if they were, say, a tradie, farmer or small-business operator who required a vehicle, was go and write off the entire cost of that vehicle. But when it came back to $20,000 under Labor those provisions weren't possible because you can't purchase too much of a car for $20,000 unless it's one of those clapped-out clunkers. We all remember the clunker policy that Labor introduced in 2010, but we won't go there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that small business should be preserved and protected, but, unfortunately, Labor does not. What they have done with their industrial relations policy and high-taxing regime is put every roadblock in the way of small businesses. No-one feels this more than those in regional Australia, and no-one feels it more in regional Australia than our farmers, who grow our food and fibre. You only have to look at last year's budget to see the largest amount of money for agriculture, for that vital sector, was $107 million for shutting down the live sheep trade. So there's Labor. They're paying more than $100 million to shut down a sector of small-business owners and operators who will be here, out the front, tomorrow. And I welcome those Labor members, particularly those West Australian Labor members, if they're not prepared to address the rally, to go and at least listen to the rally. If they care about their constituency and if they care about small businesses, listen to what those small-business owners and operators, particularly the Keep the Sheep farmers, have to say about Labor Party policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 2½ million small businesses in Australia, 60 per cent were in greater capital city areas and 31 per cent were in regional areas. I have to say that I'm proud of the third, or thereabouts, of those in regional areas. I'm proud of all small businesses. As a former small-business minister, I'm proud of what they do. I would say to those small-business owners and operators to look at the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's website, ASBFEO. It is a website well worth going to because, no matter who's in government, there's something there for those small-business owners and operators to help them get through the myriad of tax reform and legislation as far as IR is concerned.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  The member for Riverina and I can agree on that point at least. There is a lot of support out there for small businesses, no matter who's in government. The department gets on with the job, the website exists, and there's a lot of advice available for small businesses. The fact is that in developing this private member's motion, the member for Casey went to great lengths to specify the precise number of insolvent businesses this year in various states across the country, but he failed to mention two very important points: (1), what these figures mean as a percentage of total small businesses in each state; and (2) the policies behind those figures. The member for Casey conveniently ignored these points because he knows that the proportion of insolvencies out of the total number of small businesses is below the long-term historical average under the Albanese Labor government. Let me repeat that. Under the Albanese Labor government, the proportion of insolvencies out of the total number of small businesses is below the long-term historical average. I will leave it to those listening to speculate as to why the member for Casey would ignore two such important points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the deputy Liberal leader, energy prices are pushing businesses into insolvency. We hear this from the member for Lindsay incessantly. Both members voted against energy bill relief. Apparently, energy hardship is hitting small businesses harder than COVID-19, according to the deputy Liberal leader. It was the deputy Liberal leader, in the same breath, who said that only the opposition leader has a plan to get Australia back on track. What is that grand plan? It's not caps on fuel costs. The opposition leader has a 100 per cent voting record against them. And it's not rebates on energy bills. We know that the opposition leader and deputy Liberal leader, and, in fact, every member of the coalition, voted no to energy bill belief. The opposition leader's grand plan to get the country back on track is hiking energy bills with nuclear power stations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO and every credible economist agree that nuclear power will take too long to deliver in Australia and will hike up energy bill prices if it ever gets off the ground. Power bills will go up under nuclear power; in fact, your power bill will go nuclear. It will cost double that of renewables. Renewables are taking off now. They're affordable. They are the choice of the market. Yet, the opposition leader is on this fantasy of nuclear power. Don't misunderstand me. I know and accept that small-business people are doing it tough right now, but the Albanese Labor government works alongside them to get the relief they need while the Liberal Party simply pushes them under. From 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government eased energy hardship by delivering $325 of energy bill relief to nearly one million businesses nationwide—bill relief that the Liberal Party and the National Party, including the member for Casey, voted against.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off. A small business—one that earns under $10 million—will be able to immediately deduct eligible assets costing less than $20,000 until June next year. This is expected to save small businesses around $290 million. The instant asset write-off was a Labor initiative. When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister, he axed it. Then the Liberals brought it back. I'm pleased to say the instant asset write-off has bipartisan support from both Labor and the coalition, but we simply cannot accept when they say that Labor does not support it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to this quote about this instant asset write-off scheme:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It allows businesses to invest in productivity. It allows them to invest in machinery that increases their performance which keeps prices down for consumers, and it allows them to continue to grow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great quote. If you want any evidence of what a great quote it is, just ask the member for Casey. It's his quote. Here he is with a private member's motion before the House talking about the Labor government's approach to small business, and here he is quoted saying he supports our plan for instant asset write-off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nearly 2.5 million small businesses across Australia, and they employ nearly five million Australians. The Albanese Labor government supports every single one of them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="306489" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Today we face a critical debate on a pressing issue that affects us all: the state of Australian small business. I rise today to emphasise the urgent need for acknowledgement and action on the motion that's been proposed by the member for Casey, which highlights the dire situation small businesses are grappling with. Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and in Fadden we know this all too well. Our local businesses, whether the corner cafe that serves as a gathering place for our community, the family-owned store that's been a staple for generations or the small, vibrant boutique that adds character to our streets, are all crucial to our economy and to our way of life. Yet under the Albanese Labor government they are now at a breaking point, struggling under the weight of policies and red tape that seem to disregard the contribution that these businesses make to our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent data paints a troubling picture. In the last financial year alone, Australia has seen an unprecedented number of business insolvencies. In Queensland alone, 2,036 businesses have succumbed to financial ruin. This is not just a statistic; it's a reflection of countless individual dreams and livelihoods that have been shattered. The Albanese Labor government has overseen the highest number of business failures on record, surpassing even the troubling figures from 2011 and 2012. This is a record that didn't need to be broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a reflection of the resilience of Australian small businesses; let's not forget they recently weathered the storm of a once-in-a-century pandemic with grit and determination, showing their ability to adapt and overcome adversity. During that pandemic, we saw a strong coalition government that supported businesses through what was an extremely difficult time. But fast forward to today and Labor have once again shown their true colours, with small businesses being left out to dry, struggling to survive under the weight of higher energy bills, complex and impractical industrial relations laws and spiralling inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate on the Gold Coast, we have witnessed firsthand the impact of these policy failures. Local businesses are closing their doors, and with them go the vibrancy and character that define our community. Sadly, many of our favourite local businesses have closed. It's clear that the current government's approach is not working. Small business are asking for support, for understanding and for policies that truly address their needs. We need a government that not only acknowledges the problem but acts decisively to deliver on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our small businesses deserve better. They deserve better support, better policies and better government that prioritises their survival and their growth. Today's motion is a call to recognise the struggles of our small businesses and to demand a change. I recently spoke to a local businessman and said to him, 'What is it that's causing this problem at the moment that all of these small businesses are suffering?' He said it was like wave after wave of pressure that was coming. It's the power prices. It's the industrial relations laws. It's the higher prices they have to pay to their suppliers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've recently heard of the increased risk to doing businesses, business to business, because other businesses are suffering and struggling to pay suppliers' bills. This puts an enormous amount of pressure on many small businesses. Time for payments is blowing out. Payments are just not being made at all. These are the risks that people in small businesses take on. They take them on for the reward of running their own business and having their own timetable, but they shouldn't have to suffer at the hands of this Labor government's approach to how to kill a small business. For the sake of small and family businesses across our nation, I urge the government to offer the support to our small businesses that they so desperately need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  Before I became a member of this place, I ran a small, family owned business: the one my father started in 1987 out of the back of a van. He worked hard to build it up. It paid for my education and my upbringing and it has employed scores of people over the years. My entire life has been one living in and around a small business. I get small business owners and I get small business. I know the sacrifices they make and the reward that sacrifice can bring. Small-business people are my people, and I'm their person in this government. I know the challenges small businesses face and I know how important they are to our local communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses employ locals. They give our town centres vibrancy and they help grow our local and national economy. I'm constantly meeting with small businesses across Bennelong, listening to their stories of innovation, hard work and resilience. Connecting with local businesses is something I've been doing for quite some time. As a councillor, then mayor, through the good times and bad, I've been working with and alongside businesses and business chambers in Bennelong. I helped support them during COVID when I was mayor; I worked with them to make our town centres more vibrant, with more events and infrastructure; and I engaged with them nearly every day in my new role as their federal MP. I'm close to local small business and I know that small businesses are doing it tough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The post-COVID boom is over, inflation is stubbornly high and interest rates are biting. But we are a government that's offering help. Our government's policies are targeted and designed to improve the long-term resilience of small businesses. This year's budget provides more than $640 million in practical and targeted support for small businesses. The Small Business Debt Helpline is a free, government supported phone line with experienced small-business financial counsellors who can provide advice at a difficult time. Our government is also finding an expansion of the National Tax Clinic program, with an additional five clinics across the country to provide small businesses and individuals with better tax advice and help. Small businesses can also access the tax concierge service through the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, funded to provide support where there may be disputes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, $62.6 million was delivered by this government in energy efficiency grants to eligible small and medium businesses to help them save money on their energy bills and help them lower their emissions. There was also $18.6 million delivered to help small businesses adapt and build resilience through digital technology. There was a 20 per cent bonus tax deduction for employers who incurred costs to train and upskill their employees and a 20 per cent bonus tax deduction for small businesses that wanted to invest in technology and digital operations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've changed the rules to make it easier for small businesses to have more access to Commonwealth procurement and for small businesses to be paid on time, and we've delivered energy relief to one million eligible small businesses across the country. We've had to. Small businesses collectively employ more than five million Australians and contribute more than $500 billion to our nation's economy every year. Our job in government—every government's job—is to back our 2½ million small businesses to ensure that they have the confidence and certainty going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the number of corporate insolvencies has risen recently, and this is a concern for us all. With the unwinding of COVID-era relief, the number of corporate insolvencies is exceeding previous peaks. But, despite that recent increase, ASIC data indicates that, as a proportion of total companies, the level of corporate insolvencies was 0.33 per cent in 2023-24, which is lower than the long-term historical average of 0.42 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will continue to work alongside small businesses to monitor the economy and developments in this space and to provide support to small businesses as they navigate through these difficult times. Small businesses can have confidence that our government is committed to supporting them. As I said, I understand the challenges they face. I've grown up in a small business my entire life. I'm part of a government that is taking action to support them. We're providing practical support, targeted investment and sustainable policy to ensure that small businesses remain a major part of our economic growth, and that they transition from small businesses to bigger ones.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I want Australia to be the best place in the world to start and grow a business. And we can be, but currently we're not. If we are going to realise this opportunity, we must listen to the businesses we already have in this country and really understand what they need in order to do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you talk to businesses, as I have recently in Wentworth, they talk about what makes them successful. We've got a lot of great businesses that are doing well. They say, 'Look, to even survive or to thrive I need to focus on my customers, I need to focus on my suppliers and I need to work with my team.' What they say to me constantly is, 'Government needs to get out of the way or make it easy for me to do my job.' That's really what this parliament needs to do much, much better on because, frankly, businesses are having a hard time right now. Small businesses are having a disproportionately hard time right now, and we in this parliament are not doing enough to support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that in the data. We see that the number of insolvencies in Australia is higher than ever before. Of those that survived, we still see that almost half of small businesses are considering closing in the next 12 months. But we also see that in who is going into business. We see that small businesses are now only 30 per cent of the economy, when back in 2006 they were 40 per cent of the economy. We see that the proportion of young people under 30 operating a small or family business has halved since 1976. Fewer people are seeing small businesses as a pathway for their careers. This is really tragic. It's tragic at a personal level for people, but it is also a problem at an economy level. The e61 Institute has shown that productivity, an issue that we have in this country, is driven by new and emerging businesses—young, dynamic firms. But, if young people aren't starting these firms and aren't going into business, we won't have those drivers of productivity which help the entire economy. We need to be fostering these businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four things that I think we as a parliament need to fight for. These are the four things that I'm fighting for for small and medium businesses. Firstly, we need better access to business finance to build the innovative businesses of tomorrow and to back our Australian businesses. Australia has a chronic investment shortfall for young firms despite having one of the largest pension schemes in the world. In the last decade the proportion of private equity investment and superannuation funds has halved from 60 per cent to 30 per cent. This will be made worse if self-managed super funds are taxed on unrealised gains. But it's not just high-growth tech firms that are struggling. It's also about young people with a great business idea but without their own home to offer as collateral, who are struggling. When banks tell me that business lending is red-hot right now, the data tells a different story. It shows that business lending is going to the bigger businesses. It is not going to the small and medium businesses that it needs to go to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the award system has become far too complex and needs urgent streamlining. Most businesses are not maliciously underpaying workers in the small and medium businesses I talk to, but, frankly, they are struggling with the complexity of the award system. My niece came to me and asked if she was being paid right as a cafe worker. It took me 20 minutes, and I've employed a lot of people in my time. We need to have a simplified award system, and this government could be the government to lead on this. We need to take further steps to make it easy for people to employ people, and make it easy for employers and employees to know if their pay is right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the government needs to be an ally of small businesses, and that means not being an enemy. It means really looking at the regulatory settings to ensure that they're proportional and appropriate for small businesses. Government could also better use its own procurement practices to make sure that it doesn't procure from big businesses who aren't paying small business on time, as well as opening up more procurement to small businesses who are trying to get a leg into government procurement, though it's a very complex system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, we need to simplify and improve the tax system for small businesses. We need permanent tax supports in place that incentivise small businesses to invest and grow, rather than this annual politicking that we see each year around instant asset write-offs. We also need to harmonise or remove payroll tax. It hits business twice—both as a financial tax on each additional worker and as an administrative tax—due to the discrepancy across the different jurisdictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges of small business aren't new, but they are growing, and we in this parliament need to step up. The major parties are timid on these issues, whether it be tax or fundamentally making awards work for businesses and for employees. They need to step up on these key issues, and I will continue to push them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I rise today to address the critical issue of small businesses in Australia and the Albanese Labor government's unwavering commitment to their success. While we acknowledge the challenges faced by our small businesses, particularly in the wake of COVID-19, I must emphasise the remarkable resilience and entrepreneurial spirit that has emerged in these trying times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To competently address the allegations made by the member for Casey, we must put the current situation into perspective. The Commonwealth Bank's recent research reveals an inspiring trend: since the pandemic began, one in three Australians has started or plans to start a small business. This entrepreneurial surge has been nothing short of remarkable, with new business entities increasing by 20 per cent in the 2022 financial year alone. When we consider insolvencies as a proportion of the overall number of businesses, which is growing significantly, they are not at historical heights. In fact, they are not even back to pre-pandemic levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the Albanese Labor government's comprehensive approach to supporting small businesses by demonstrating how this year's budget reflects our dedication, providing more than $640 million in practical and targeted support for small businesses. We have extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off until 30 June 2025, providing $290 million in tax relief to help business invest and grow. We are delivering a $325 energy bill relief rebate for eligible small businesses, as part of a $3.5 billion energy bill relief package. We are providing financial counselling and mental health support by committing $10.8 million to extend the Small Business Debt Helpline and the NewAccess for Small Business Owners program. We are investing $25.3 million to strengthen the Payment Times Reporting Scheme, ensuring fair and timely payments to small businesses. We are providing $2.6 million in dispute resolution support to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to help resolve disputes. We are investing $34.5 million in cybersecurity initiatives, with programs like Cyber Wardens and the Small Business Cyber Resilience Service. We are funding 20,000 additional fee-free TAFE and VET places, focusing on skills and education in industries where small businesses are prevalent. We are expanding the National Tax Clinic Program, with five additional tax support clinics across the country, offering expert tax advice to small businesses. We are also allocating $3 million to implementing Franchising Code of Conduct reforms, improving protections for franchisees. These measures demonstrate the Albanese Labor government's ongoing commitment to the 2.5 million small businesses that collectively employ more than five million Australians and contribute over $500 million to our nation's economy every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government understands that small businesses are the engine room of our economy. We are not just helping them survive; we are positioning them to thrive in a post-pandemic world. Our policies are targeted at improving their long-term resilience and providing practical support for those facing challenges. The entrepreneurial boom we have witnessed is a testament to the Australian spirit. It is our job to nurture this spirit and provide the right environment for it to flourish. That is exactly what we are doing with our comprehensive support package. But the recovery isn't easy. The government is here to support small business every step of the way. We will help them adapt, innovate and succeed. Our commitment to this sector remains unwavering and we are confident that with the right support and policies Australian small businesses will continue to be the backbone of our economy for many, many years to come. The future of Australian small businesses is bright under the Albanese Labor government, which is dedicated to ensuring they have every opportunity to reach their full potential.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news is that the pay gap between men and women in Australia is shrinking. The motion I move today recognises the significant progress that the Albanese Labor government has made to address the gender pay gap and, in doing so, advance the economic empowerment of Australian women. It comes despite the opposition's efforts to block and repeal many of Labor's measures. Labor is delivering better and more equal pay for Australian women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gender pay gap represents more than just a number. It reflects a range of deeply ingrained structural barriers that women face in the workforce, barriers that restrict our earning potential, limit our career opportunities and contribute to ongoing gender inequality. I recognise the connection between women's financial autonomy and their overall wellbeing. Financial independence is a key factor in ensuring a woman's safety and security. It gives them the power to make choices about their lives and their future. Closing the gender pay gap is key.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came into government in 2022 we promised to close the gender pay gap between men and women, and we are making significant progress. Recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the gender pay gap is now the lowest on record. It fell from 14.1 per cent in May 2022 to it now being 11.5 per cent. That's significant. Under Labor, women's average weekly earnings have increased by $173. This isn't by chance. It is deliberate. It's by design. It's the result of real action and taking bold steps to break down barriers and make real progress. We have banned pay secrecy clauses, we have reformed the bargaining system, we have enforced transparent pay-gap reporting and we have delivered pay increases for aged-care and childcare workers, predominantly feminised industries. Our efforts to lift wages in sectors like aged care and child care, which are dominated by women, are absolutely helping. We have funded a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood educators and care workers. This is a largely female workforce who have been, for far too long, underpaid for the essential work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also introduced better and fairer tax cuts. Labor's tax cuts have put more money in the pockets of 90 per cent of working women. We have also committed $1.1 billion over four years to pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave from July 2025. This will ensure that women do not fall further behind than their male counterparts in securing their financial future simply because they took time out of the workforce to care for families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we're investing $427 million to provide financial support for students for mandatory nursing, midwifery and social work placements. These are mostly staffed by women. By reducing the financial burden on them to do their placements we are making it financially easier and fairer for women to complete these important qualifications. We're also expanding paid parental leave to 26 weeks by July 2026, giving families more flexibility and more choice. We are working hard to increase women's participation in science, technology, engineering and maths by investing $38 million over eight years to foster a more diverse and skilled STEM workforce. We're also allocating $55 million over four years to establish the Building Women's Careers Program. By supporting women's progression in leadership roles, we are insuring that women indeed have a seat at the decision-making table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In total, it is a comprehensive plan that is driving progress and demonstrates that women are at the heart of Labor's economic plan. I commend the government for its ongoing commitment to improving the lives of Australian women, making them fairer and more equal. This progress benefits everyone, not just women. It's good for men, it's good for families, it's good for the economy and it's good for our entire community. It's good news, but we know that the work is far from over.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I rise to speak on this issue in relation to the gender pay gap. I want to first of all acknowledge that data recently released by the ABS does show that the national gender pay gap is the lowest on record. It's now fallen, based on those statistics, to 11.5 per cent. This is good news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected, I've spoken on many occasions about the need for the government to do more for women, particularly on paid parental leave. That is why I am very pleased that the government has now agreed to include superannuation, for example, on government funded paid parental leave from 1 July 2025. That was supported by those on my side and, similarly, the expansion of paid parental leave—with access to up to 26 weeks of leave by July 2026—is a measure that's been supported by the coalition. This is to be commended because for far too many years now women have been financially punished for the intrinsic role that they have in bearing children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are measures that will go some way to assisting women with both the gender pay gap and the disparity between Australian women's average superannuation balances and Australian men's. Women's superannuation currently sits at about two-thirds of the superannuation balance that males have, and this is particularly concerning when it is recognised that women also tend to live for a lot longer. We are now in a situation where, I think, this is at a crisis point. We're now in a situation where we need to be pulling out everything we can to help women increase their superannuation balances to ensure their security into retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This then moves us into a space where the government has significantly failed and continues to fail women and Australians overall, and that space is housing. In March 2022, this Prime Minister went into the election and said that mortgages and rents would be cheaper under Labor, but, after two and a half years, that is simply not the case. In fact, the average Australian mortgage holder has paid $35,000 more in interest than they were paying two and a half years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of the housing crisis is particularly costly to Australian women. I just had a look at a study that was done by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute recently, and it revealed a couple of points that I will quickly summarise. Women are less likely to be able to save for a deposit on a home. For those who do manage, it takes far longer; on average, it takes a year longer for a single woman to save for a deposit than it does for a single Australian man. Women are, therefore, far less likely to own a home to support them into retirement. Also, older women who are paying off a mortgage experience much higher levels of stress than their male peers, which obviously impacts both their health and their wellbeing and places further demands on our health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most severely, as housing does become less affordable, the number of women experiencing homelessness continues to rise, with the rate of increase for women being much higher than the rate for men. In that space, women over the age of 55 in Australia are now the fastest growing demographic of homeless Australians. This is something that needs to be addressed urgently, and there are measures that this government could put in place that would help to achieve that. For example, homeownership is shown to be one of the greatest safeguards and one of the best ways to improve quality of life into retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is mind-blowing that the Labor government won't allow women the choice to be able to withdraw their superannuation if they so wish to be able to purchase a home. It is significantly impacting women, particularly older women over the age of 55 and 60 who may have experienced a divorce and then are unable to buy their own home with the proceeds from the family law settlement. That's why the coalition supports this very sensible policy, and I call on the Labor government to also support this if they are in fact serious about women. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on this private member's motion relating to the gender pay gap moved by my friend and office neighbour the member for Swan. Isn't it just excellent news that the national gender pay gap continues to fall under this government and has fallen to the lowest on record, some 11.5 per cent? It's no coincidence that this has occurred underneath the Albanese Labor government. We made a commitment to close the gap, and this is exactly what's happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to my role as an MP, I worked as a professional in the community sector for 32 years in roles supporting children, young people, women and men to learn and grow and find a job. In short, these roles achieved self-determination that leads to economic participation. I've held these roles at a national, state and local level. I recently have spent the better part of the last decade working with women who are experiencing economic hardship due to domestic, family and sexual violence or an acrimonious separation. Despite the responsibility and seniority of these roles, I have always earned considerably less than my husband and other men I know who work in the community sector. It frustrated me greatly and made me feel my work and that of my female colleagues was not valued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has taken real action to drive down the gender pay gap. An extra 510,000 women are now in jobs since the Albanese government came to office, with 60 per cent of these jobs full time. Women's average weekly earnings have increased by $173 a week since May 2022. We've also modernised the bargaining system, enforcing gender pay gap reporting and importantly delivering substantial pay rises for aged-care and childcare workers. These are heavily female dominated industries, and these workers absolutely deserve the pay rise they are getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best part is that this is not only good for women but also good for the economy. In its report, the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, led by the Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, identified that Australia loses $28 billion per annum due to women being underemployed or unemployed. That is why closing the gender pay gap is a key ambition for Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality, which outlines the Australian government's vision for gender equality—an Australia where people are treated with respect, have choices and have access to resources and equal outcomes no matter their gender.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside reducing the gender pay gap, another key part of continuing to progress gender equality is the development of a 10-year national plan to end gendered violence. The first-ever national plan will work to end domestic and family violence against women and children in a generation. This investment includes a range of measures that work to mitigate the impact that domestic family and sexual violence have on women and their safety, self-determination and financial independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Albanese government, my colleagues and peers for focusing on women in their economic plan. Women are the heart of Labor's economic plan. That is loud and clear. This is good for women, good for men, good for children, good for the community and good for the economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  The coalition supports women's economic security. The coalition has always supported women's economic security. In government, we delivered more than $5.5 billion in funding for women through our women's budget statements. Our policies boosted workforce participation to record levels, reduced the gender pay gap and empowered more women to run their own businesses. That's really important because that's income. We continue to support the closing of the gender pay gap. We welcomed the first annual release of gender pay gap data from corporate Australia this year from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. And we put corporates on notice. They need to be doing more than just talking the talk. We don't need to see more morning teas and cupcakes with pink icing; we need real policies to promote and support women across Australia. Those opposite were happy to spend time and money on social policies such as the Voice campaign, but are they willing to do the same to reduce the gender pay gap for good?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so important that we close not only the gender pay but also the superannuation gap. Far too many women are being left behind with less in their superannuation balance in retirement compared to their male counterparts. We hear it time and time again. That's women aged 55 and over, which is my age. That is very confronting for many women in that age bracket because we are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians. That's scary if your relationship or your marriage breaks down and there are legal proceedings. Women in this age group are finding themselves in insecure housing. It's so real for those who are struggling with cost-of-living pressures right now. They're paying ridiculous rent under this government's watch. They're paying ridiculous amounts of money and watching their lifestyles go backwards under this Prime Minister.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports the principle of super on government funded paid parental leave. We support that principle. We have a strong record in supporting women's economic security. It's important to note that Labor is 14 years late to this policy. The coalition actually took paid parental leave policies to the 2010 and 2013 elections, which included paying superannuation on government funded paid parental leave, only for them to be opposed by those opposite and their political partners, the Greens. We extended PPL in government and are working to improve the government's current proposal to extend its recent extension to 26 weeks. While this helps support women and families in the long run, it doesn't help families struggling with the cost-of-living pressures right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be real: superannuation is important, but increasing homeownership is critical to boosting women's economic security. We know that the key to economic security is housing security, with no or little mortgage payments in your retirement years. When heading towards that 60 to 65 mark, you should be able to gear up the rest of your life to have secure housing and not pay huge rent to a landlord. That's why we believe in homeownership so much on this side; in fact, we have a shadow minister for homeownership. We believe Australians should be able to use their superannuation to draw down on a deposit to buy their own home, which is the biggest purchase they will make in their lifetime. With growing figures of older women finding themselves homeless, homeownership in retirement has never been more important. I can't stress this point enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see stronger action taken on women's safety. This is something the coalition was focused on in government. We have repeatedly expressed our commitment to combating the scourge of domestic violence in this country. Too many women were killed as a result of violence in 2024, and too many others were assaulted. One is too many. It must come to an end. I've spoken about this before in this place and demanded that it come to an end. The numbers are going in the wrong direction and immediate action is required. We need the government to actually deliver on the promises it makes, particularly when it comes to the safety of women and children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not good enough that this Labor government committed to 500 frontline services and community workers to support those experiencing family and domestic violence almost two years ago. Almost two years ago and they've failed to deliver on that commitment. In the Prime Minister's own state of New South Wales, there are only 30 workers on the ground out of the 148 he promised. Again, we see broken promises from this Prime Minister. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I'll get straight to the facts. Under Labor, the gender pay gap has narrowed. Under Labor, we've seen a $173.80 increase in women's average weekly earnings. Under Labor, we've funded a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood educators and aged-care workers, an industry dominated by women. Under Labor, women's workforce participation has reached a record high of 63.2 per cent. Under Labor, every female taxpayer got a tax cut and 90 per cent of women got a better tax cut than under the Liberals. Under Labor, we've committed $1.1 billion over four years to pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave and reformed paid parental leave for the first time since its inception to get it to 26 weeks. Under Labor, we will provide $427.4 million over four years to support students in mandatory nursing, social work and teaching placements—industries also traditionally dominated by women. Under Labor, we are investing $38.2 million over eight years to support a thriving, skilled and diverse STEM workforce, one that simply must attract more women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Political parties are not the same. All this happened under Labor, and all in our first term of government. We are committed to developing policies and investing in programs that will improve women's economic empowerment because we recognise the connection between the safety of women and their financial autonomy and wellbeing. The connection between economic security and safety for women cannot be overstated. Financial autonomy is critical to ensuring that women can live their lives free from violence and abuse. When women earn less than men, when their work is undervalued, they are more vulnerable to financial dependence and exploitation. By closing the gender pay gap, we're not only promoting economic justice but fostering a society where women can live with dignity, free from fear. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that economic security also relies on addressing the systemic issues that cause and perpetuate the gender pay gap. That's why this government has banned secrecy pay clauses, modernised bargaining systems and introduced transparent gender pay gap reporting. These reforms have got wages moving again, particularly for women. They will ensure that wage disparity cannot be hidden and that employers are held accountable for creating equitable workplaces. When women thrive, Australia thrives. Women's increased earnings and workforce participation contribute to household incomes, reduce poverty rates and stimulate consumer spending. Closing the gender pay gap benefits us all. When we pay women fairly, we set a standard for future generations. We teach our children that equality is not just an ideal but a reality that we are committed to achieving. We show that the work women do—whether in the classroom, in hospitals, in boardrooms or in parliament—is valued and essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While today's figures in this motion are worth celebrating, they are by all means not the end of the road. An 11.5 per cent gender pay gap remains an unacceptable inequality. It's still too high. The average woman working full time still earns $231.50 less per week than her male counterpart. That's over $12,000 less per year, an amount that affects her ability to save for retirement, pay off her mortgage or support her family. We cannot be complacent as a government. Our work simply must continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to doing more. We will soon release an employment white paper to further address structural inequalities in the workplace. We are also committed to further reform of the Workplace Gender Equality Act, ensuring that all employers take active steps to close gender pay gaps. This government will not rest until every woman in Australia is paid what she's worth and has the same opportunities to succeed as her male colleagues. We are committed to gender equality and, to have that, we will need to continue to reform. Our government have a commitment to putting women at the centre of our nation's economic plan. We want to make the lives of Australian women safer, fairer and more equal. As we reflect on the progress, we must recognise that progress does not happen by accident. The gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest on record, but we still have much more to do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  To build an economy that truly works for everyone, we must ensure it works for women, and an economy that works for women must deliver wage parity. The Albanese government is committed to this goal. I would like to thank the member for Swan, who has moved this important motion. The Albanese government recognises that, while we have made significant strides towards closing the gender pay gap, there is still much more work to be done; however, the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the Albanese government is on the right track. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, with Australia's national gender pay gap now reaching its lowest point on record. Since the Albanese government came to office, it has fallen from 14.1 per cent in May 2022 to 11.5 per cent today. That's no fluke. It's no coincidence. It's because our government has taken action to ban pay secrecy clauses, modernised the bargaining system, enforced transparent gender pay gap reporting and delivered pay rises for aged-care and early childhood educators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Corangamite, early years educator and amazing United Workers Union advocate Raelee Fechner told my office that the pay rise for early years educators will be an absolute game changer. She said: 'It's a good move. Some educators are working two or three jobs and, with this pay rise, they will have a much better work-life balance.' For this feminised sector which is facing worker shortages, this significant pay rise is meaningful progress and it will put a dent in the gender pay gap. It will mean more mums who are working as early childhood educators will be better rewarded for the incredible work they do. More than that, soon-to-be mums will now have access to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave by July 2026 under our government. On top of that, women will also be paid superannuation on paid parental leave. It will not be just women, but it will make a difference to the gender pay gap. We're investing $1.1 billion over four years to make this a reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government is doing this because we understand that families cannot always afford or access formal caregiving—child care, elder care or home care. For those families, women are often the ones to step up, and when women step up they usually reduce their working hours, leave the workforce or juggle multiple jobs, both paid and unpaid. That's why we're expanding paid parental leave. It's why we're boosting wages for feminised workforces and it's why we'll pay super on paid parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures will go a long way to closing the gender pay gap. As a result, women can have greater confidence in having a family and returning to work in a timely way—a way that enables women to have a family if they choose, build a career, boost their super and continue to earn a good wage. On women's wages: since we came to government, women's average weekly earnings have increased by more than $173. We've secured record pay rises for women on award wages, fixed the bargaining system to get wages moving in feminised industries and changed workplace laws to put gender equity at the heart of the Fair Work Commission's decision-making. This is despite the opposition opposing almost every single one of our measures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that the gap has narrowed, an extra 510,000 women are now in jobs since the Albanese government came to office, with 60 per cent of these jobs being full-time. We're also delivering a bigger tax cut for 90 per cent of Australian women taxpayers, much bigger than the former coalition government had promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, closing the gender pay gap is not only a moral imperative; it also means there will be a larger pool of workers to fill jobs and grow our economy. Ensuring fair pay and equal opportunities for women strengthens our economy and enriches our society because, when women do well, we all do well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Friends, I stand here today to pay tribute to a remarkable Australian. Steele Hall was the 36th Premier of South Australia, serving in that role between 1968 and 1970, after which he entered federal parliament as a senator for South Australia, serving in that role between 1974 and 1977. Then, remarkably, he was the member for Boothby between the years of 1981 and 1996. Steele Hall is the only Australian to have served as a premier of a state as well as a member of three legislatures. Sadly, on 10 June this year, Steele Hall died at the age of 95, having lived an extraordinary life, leaving a profound political legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steele was born in 1928 in Balaklava, a country town in the mid-north of South Australia. He was educated there and worked on his family's 800-acre sheep and wheat farm at Owen, a 20-minute drive out of Balaklava. In 1959, at the age of 31, Steele was elected on behalf of the Liberal and Country League as the member for Gouger. He was a member of the then Playford government and quickly gained a reputation for his independent thinking and his shoot-from-the-hip style—something which, of course, resonates with me. In spite of this—or perhaps because of it—and because of his forthrightness, he rose through the ranks of the party. Following Playford's loss in 1965, Steele was endorsed by Sir Thomas Playford as his successor. After just two years in opposition, Steele returned the Liberal and Country League to government in 1968.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steele Hall was a conviction politician before we knew what that term meant—a man of courage and integrity. Necessarily, many of the positions that Steele adopted weren't popular, and, indeed, some in his own party from time to time disagreed with Steele, but it was that courage that I admired. Now, I could wax lyrical about some of Steele Hall's key accomplishments as premier, include the development of important industries such as the gas industry in South Australia, the improvement of Aboriginal rights and the fluoridation of the Adelaide water supply, but there are two things that stand out for me. Firstly, he is remembered for having reformed the electoral system in South Australia to better reflect the principle of 'one vote, one value'. Inequitable electoral boundaries, commonly known as the playmander, had greatly advantaged the Liberal and Country League over previous decades. Steele's introduction of electoral reforms jeopardised his own prospects of retaining the premiership, but nonetheless he was committed to the principle of democratic electoral fairness and to working for the greater good of the South Australian economy. It goes without saying that the introduction of these reforms was a major reason for his defeat in 1970.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue, of course, was his support for the proposal of the Dartmouth Dam—a decision which was ultimately right, albeit unpopular at the time. It typified Steele's unrelenting pursuit of the state and national interest. Two years later, after many combative episodes within the Liberal and Country League, headstrong Steele splintered from the party, set up the Liberal Movement and was elected to the Senate under that standard in 1974. He then quit the Senate three years later to unsuccessfully contest the federal lower house seat of Hawker, but by 1981 he was back in the Liberal ranks, returning as the member for Boothby in Adelaide's south, holding that seat through to 1996. I acknowledge the current member for Boothby has joined us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a Liberal Party function in Adelaide just last week, the Hon. John Howard, while reflecting on the life of Steele Hall, described him as 'reformative and transformative'. That, friends, is high praise from the greatest living Liberal. His political life and legacy was anything but lacklustre. His contribution to South Australia was enormous, his capacity for debate legendary, his intellect and competitive energy unrivalled. His close friend and former political adviser, Sir Lynton Crosby AO, describes Steele as a 'principled maverick, a man from the plains, a farmer, a politician and, above all, a man of integrity and strength—plain speaking, plain values'. Oh, for some of those plain-speaking, strong values today in this place, a place he is familiar with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer my heartfelt condolences to his wife, Joan, who is here today, herself a former member of the South Australian Parliament, serving as the member for Coles and subsequently Morialta and as Minister for Youth and Employment and Minister for Tourism; and to Steele's six children and grandchildren. Thank you, Steele, for your services to South Australia and to the nation. Vale, Steele Hall.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I'd like to congratulate the member for Barker for moving this motion about a very great Australian. As members may be aware, a state memorial service to celebrate the life of Mr Steele Hall was held on 1 July at the Adelaide Festival Centre, hosted by the government of SA. The state memorial service honoured Mr Hall's life and his contribution to South Australian politics. His leadership showed a determination to do what he recognised to be in the best interests of South Australians, and he leaves behind a reputation for integrity and for political courage. By introducing landmark legislation that changed the way voters were weighted during the elections, he reformed the state's electoral system. Other significant reforms and actions under his leadership were in areas including abortion access, Aboriginal affairs, the state's natural gas industry and his opposition to a dam at Chowilla in the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Switching from state politics to federal politics in 1974, Mr Hall was elected to the Senate, where he served until 1977, and was the member for Boothby in the House of Representatives from 1981 to 1996. With a parliamentary career spanning more than 33 years, Mr Hall was the only Australian to serve as premier of a state as well as a member of three legislatures and was the leader of two political parties, one of which he founded. It's fitting that Mr Hall's state memorial service was held at the Adelaide Festival Centre. It is almost impossible to imagine Adelaide without this iconic building, which was the first of its kind in Australia and finished almost six months earlier than the Sydney Opera House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When potential sites for Adelaide's top-tier performance venue were first discussed in the mid-sixties, discussion centred around the location in North Adelaide at the old Bonython family estate, Carclew, on Montefiore Hill. However, the then Premier, Steele Hall, made an official visit to the UK during which he visited the Royal Festival Hall on the banks of the Thames. I'm told that, at this moment, Premier Hall envisaged a world-class riverfront theatre with breathtaking views of Adelaide's waterfront vista. By the time Premier Hall left office, a new site had been selected at the former Adelaide Baths on the banks of the River Torrens, with the then incoming government of Don Dunstan continuing the project, which resulted in the magnificent Adelaide Festival Centre site as we see it today. The view from the festival centre, down the sloping lawns of Elder Park, across the river to Adelaide Oval and St Peter's Cathedral is now forever part of the proud remains of a legacy that Steele Hall left to South Australians, who he served diligently and with distinction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1988, we saw his courage in crossing the floor to vote against his own party leader who proposed to make race a determinant in migrant intake. Mr Hall found this to be personally repugnant and dangerously corrosive to Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Mr Hall retired as member for Boothby ahead of the 1996 election, a journalist asked him to sum up his time in politics. He replied, perhaps with a hint of well-earned pride:</span>

To Joan, her six children and six grandchildren, our heartfelt condolences go out to the family. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I'd like to absolutely commence by acknowledging the Hon. Joan Hall, who's with us today. It's a great honour to bestow on us for you, Joan, to come to Canberra and be here to witness a very important tribute to your late husband, the Hon. Steele Hall. I thank my colleague the member for Barker for bringing this motion to the chamber. It is very touching that we've got so many South Australian members of the House of Representatives here with us today for this debate from both sides of the chamber. Indeed, in the period since Steele's passing, it is a mark and a measure of the man that all sides of politics have had such tributes to pay to Steele Hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the points that the member for Barker made about his time as Premier and concur with them wholeheartedly, particularly the two matters that he singled out regarding electoral reform and the Dartmouth Dam. Indeed, it was the issue of the Dartmouth Dam that, of course, led to an early election in 1970, because the Independent member for the seat we now refer to as the Riverland, who held the balance of power in the House, wanted to see the Chowilla Dam built instead of Dartmouth. That was one of the many examples in Steele Hall's career where he put the right decision ahead of the easy decision. It would have been very easy for him to succumb to the politics and the parochialism of that. Instead, he was prepared to put the interests of South Australia at the fore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his career as Premier, whilst it was only for a couple of years, we can reflect on the achievements of those few years. A lot of people would say that it's not the time in government; it's what you do with that time that counts. Steele Hall's legacy from his time as Premier is very, very significant and substantial. He served in that very famous Senate that dealt with the challenging 1975 deferral of the budget. It would have been a remarkable time to serve in Old Parliament House, when the cut and thrust and tension of that moment was occurring. He was, of course, a participant in something that is one of the most famous chapters of federal politics, of Australian politics—the 1975 ultimate dismissal of the Whitlam government. His time in the Senate, not only specific to that but a range of other issues, in and of itself is quite fascinating. Then, of course, most importantly to all of us as members of the House of Representatives, he indeed served in our chamber from 1981 to 1996. As the member for Barker also pointed out, last week in Adelaide, former Prime Minister John Howard took the opportunity to reflect on the career of Steele Hall with the same types of descriptors that we've heard by everyone that has paid tribute to the life and the contribution to public life of Steele Hall, a man of great conviction, a man always prepared to put his values and his views and what he thought was the right way forward ahead of anything else, sometimes in very difficult circumstances and sometimes in ways that brought tension within his own political party, let alone the challenges that always befall us when we do things that we know are right against the zeitgeist in public life. But that was exactly who Steele Hall was and that's why he leaves such a spectacular legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Adelaide just indicated, indeed his memorial was held at the Festival Centre on the banks of the Torrens. It's been really important to reflect on that particular part of Steele Hall's legacy since his passing: that it was indeed his personal intervention that ensured that we have the beautiful Festival Theatre there on the banks of the River Torrens—one of the many things that Steele Hall leaves as a legacy for his service. In three chambers—quite remarkable—three very significant contributions were made that in and of themselves were significant. To what he did throughout his adult life in contributing to the people of South Australia and the people of Australia we pay deep tribute today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan: to you, of course, our deepest condolences. We know it's been a very difficult few months for you and your family. Our heart goes out to you. Thank you so much for the way in which you've allowed all of us to celebrate Steele's life, celebrate his contribution and make sure that we've marked in an appropriate way the legacy of a great Australian. Vale, Steele Hall. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I rise to honour the memory of Raymond Steele Hall, known as Steele, a giant of Liberal politics in South Australia who served his community at state and federal levels for some 33 years. I'd like to thank the member for Barker for moving this motion and I'd like to acknowledge the Hon. Joan Hall here today. Mr Hall was born in Balaklava in the state's mid-north in 1928. He attended local schools and worked on his family's property when he left school. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly, serving as the member for Gouger from 1959 to 1973 and the member for Goyder from 1973 to 1974. He was the 36th Premier of South Australia from 1968 to 1970 and he went on to serve as a federal senator from 1974 to 1977 and as the member for Boothby from 1981 to 1996. There surely aren't many individuals who've served in so many ways at state and federal levels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hall is known as a man of principle, committed to doing what he felt was the right thing even when that meant he would pay a personal and political cost. He is particularly remembered for ending the so-called playmander, an inequitable electoral system which meant that the votes of people living in Adelaide—two-thirds of the South Australian population—were worth less than the votes of those living in the country. By expanding the number of seats in the House of Assembly, albeit not quite to equity, he knew that he was effectively handing government to the Labor Party, which had attracted 52 per cent of the vote at the previous election. The changes he brought in reinforced the democratic principle of 'one vote, one value', something that I think we cherish in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hall was also responsible for a number of pieces of legislation, including improvements to social welfare, Aboriginal affairs, abortion regulation and advancing fluoridation of the South Australian water supply. He worked with the subsequent Dunstan state Labor government to introduce adult suffrage and for proportional representation for the South Australia Legislative Council. Mr Hall won a federal Senate seat at the double dissolution election of 1974, triggering a by-election in Goyder, and subsequently worked with the Whitlam government again on electoral reform. Despite being against the Whitlam government, he voted against the blocking of supply, saying that the Senate should be a house of review, not a house of execution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hall resigned from the Senate in November 1977 to run unsuccessfully for the federal seat of Hawker. Then he won the seat of Boothby in 1981, having beaten Alexander Downer for the preselection. He mostly served as a backbencher in the federal government, although he served as shadow state minister in the Peacock opposition in 1983. He again demonstrated his principled stance in the federal realm when he and two other Liberal members crossed the floor against opposition leader John Howard's motion to use race as a criteria for selecting immigrants, voting with the Labor government. He stated at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The question has quickly descended from a discussion about the future migrant intake to one about the level of internal racial tolerance. The simple fact is that public opinion is easily led on racial issues. It is now time to unite the community on the race issue before it flares into an ugly reproach for us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hall passed on 10 June 2024 at the age of 95. He is survived by his wife, Joan, herself a former state member of parliament, and six children. I offer them my sincere condolences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish by quoting another South Australia Liberal Premier, John Olsen. John Olsen said of Mr Hall:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">His principles were always unimpeachable. He was a politician that had courage of his convictions and followed through on them, even though he put at risk his government and his premiership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the hallmark of the way in which he operated—always a principle, applying integrity and certainly courage in politics. Mrs Hall, this is truly a life well lived, and Mr Hall's outstanding service to the community is to be much admired. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I thank the member for Barker for bringing this motion forward. From the outset, I recognise Joan Hall in the chamber, as my colleagues have done. Welcome, Joan. I extend Teresa's and my condolences to your family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, Steele was born in Balaklava in 1928. He worked on the family farm in Owen, nowadays the wonderful electorate of Grey. He was elected to the seat of Gouger in 1959 and became Leader of the Opposition in 1965 following the retirement of Sir Thomas Playford on the eve of the election in 1965, which was subsequently lost to the Labor party. He was elected Premier in 1968, which was a wonderful turnaround for the Liberal Party. He distinguished himself as a statesman as opposed to a political animal when he undertook the reforms of the electoral system, removing the previous bias that allowed much lower populations in country seats, knowing full well it was likely to lead to defeat at the next election. That's a man who was prepared to sacrifice power on a matter of principle and fairness. In and of itself, that alone is a very telling story of Steele Hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms were not the only reason Steele Hall lost the 1970 election. His term as premier was cut short by the loss of support of the Independent, Tommy Stott, over the proposed Chowilla Dam. If ever there was a good reason not to have too many Independents in this place, perhaps that's it. But Steele Hall recognised Chowilla for the environmental disaster that it would have been. It would have salted up the bottom end of the Murray. And, despite good evidence being available to all, Chowilla was supported by the opposition leader, Don Dunstan, in a tub-thumping, state's right platform in the 1970 election, a position he then abandoned in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't come from a political family, but, in 1970, I started to take an interest. It always seemed an incredible injustice that someone could campaign for something in an election and then turn around and do something else as soon as the election was won. That's another example of Steele Hall standing against the mob for what was right, which exemplified his strength and conviction. It is in retrospect that Steele Hall should be appreciated as a visionary. He was the Premier who identified the banks of the Torrens as a place to build the festival centre and set the wheels in motion to build it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He legislated the Metropolitan Adelaide transport study, a plan which included a north-south freeway corridor through Adelaide, and under his government the electorally painful work of land acquisition was largely completed. Sadly, the election spelt the end of that project, and later the land was sold off. What a folly. The estimated cost of land acquisition and construction for the entire proposal was $574,000,000 in 1968, which equates to about $7 billion today in 2024. Following tens of billions spent on another half a dozen or so sections of the north-south corridor, we are now spending another $15 billion to complete the final 15 kilometres of the same pathway—$1½ billion a kilometre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steele Hall's time as premier was all too short. Following the almost inevitable loss in the 1970 election, support for Steele within his party fell away until eventually he left the Liberal Party and formed the Liberal Movement, for which he won a three-year term in the Senate in the 1974 double dissolution, which was in turn truncated by the 1975 dismissal election, in which he was narrowly returned. These were tumultuous years, and Steele was not always the favourite of his former Liberal colleagues. In 1977 he resigned his Senate seat to contest the seat of Hawker, which he narrowly lost. However, following the narrow loss in the 1975 state election, the conservative forces set about bringing the Liberal Party back together, and in 1981 Steele contested Boothby for the Liberal Party, won it and held it for the subsequent 15 years before he retired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In total he served 33 years in three different houses of parliament: the House of Assembly, the Senate and, of course, the House of Representatives—a remarkable contribution to public life by a remarkable man, sometimes a maverick, certainly a visionary, always a man sure of his judgement and a conviction politician. The world is a far poorer place for his passing, but we are much better for his presence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  I begin by acknowledging Joan Hall, who is with us tonight, whom I have known for many, many years and whom I have the utmost respect for. A state funeral was held on 1 July at the Adelaide Festival Centre to honour the life of Raymond Steele Hall, better known as Steele, a name that befitted his character. It was a well-deserved farewell to an outstanding South Australian who had served in the state and federal parliaments and, uniquely, had served in the South Australian House of Assembly, including as SA Premier and in both the federal Senate and the house of Representatives. It was just as fitting, as others have already said, that the service was held in Adelaide Festival Centre, an Adelaide CBD landmark that graces the picturesque River Torrens precinct, that puts Adelaide on the global performing arts stage and that Steele Hall had delivered as SA Premier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did that during an era of progressive policy battles between himself and Don Dunstan, both of whom were strong debaters, both with visionary and transformative policies for South Australia. Perhaps their most robust encounter—and I can well remember it—was their disagreement over whether South Australia would be best served by the Dartmouth Dam or the dam at Chowilla in South Australia, just outside of Renmark. As others have quite rightly pointed out, ultimately the Dartmouth Dam is where it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I reflect on Steele Hall, I think of a man of conviction, integrity and courage: conviction to stand up for what he believed in, integrity to do what was right and courage to stand up to powerful critics even within his own political party to the point of crossing the floor in federal parliament and ending the pro-Liberal South Australian electoral boundary gerrymander, which undoubtedly cost him the 1970 election. His achievements are many and, although the following examples are just a sample, they highlight the social and moral justice that drove Steele Hall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Steele Hall supported the lowering of the voting age from 21 years to 18 years. As a senator, he was critical of the blocking of supply to the Whitlam government. He founded the South Australian Liberal Movement, which became a progressive arm for South Australian Liberal voters between 1973 and 1976. He spoke out against racism and cuts to social welfare. He supported journalistic freedom. He took a stand for Indigenous Australians. These are all issues which are still so important today, and yet way back then in the 1970s and 1980s, when perhaps it took courage to take a stand on them, Steele Hall did that. In so many respects, he was ahead of his time on the issues that he fought so hard for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having entered parliament at the young age of 31 years, Steele Hall had served as a parliamentarian for 33 years at the time of his retirement in 1996. However, he was never too far away from the political fray, with his wife, Joan, serving in the state parliament between 1993 and 2006. I last saw Steele Hall at the 40th anniversary dinner of the Para Hills Community Club in the Makin electorate, which, as South Australian Premier 40 years earlier, Steele had opened. I still have the photographs of him doing that back in my office. On the night, both Steele and Joan were clearly the drawcard for the evening dinner. They came into the room, and I think everyone was so happy to see the both of them there joining with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To you, Joan, and to your whole family, I say thank you for the service that Steele gave our nation—not just our state, our nation. He did make a difference to our country, as others have quite rightly pointed out. To you and the family, I extend my sincere losses at his passing. I'm sorry I couldn't get to the funeral; I would have liked to. Once again, my condolences.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  As the token New South Welsh person in this debate, I wanted to join others in honouring a great South Australian and to acknowledge the presence of Joan Hall here in the House today. South Australia has played an outsized role in this parliament. It's produced some of our greatest characters and our greatest contributors since Federation, and Steele Hall was one of those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many members of the House know, I'm something of a Constitution nerd, and I first encountered Steele Hall because he is the great academic example of why we can never properly cater for anything in the Constitution. In 1977, we codified the way in which you replace senators when casual vacancies occur. That assumes that somebody from one party who might retire is replaced by somebody from the same party. Almost as soon as that had happened, Steele himself left the parliament, but his party had ceased to exist, and so a new convention was made. I think other speakers have covered many of his other great contributions, but I wanted to add that, and I wanted to add my condolences to Joan and all those who admired a great Australian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week was Men's Shed Week 2024, and the theme for this year's Men's Shed Week was 'send him down to the shed'. It is a message that shed members across the country are hoping to be heard throughout their local communities to encourage more men to get involved and join their local shed. You don't have to have a trade or know certain skills to join a men's shed. It's not all about woodworking and welding. While these skills can be drivers of activity in shed life, so many members are there just for the social interaction, for a cuppa and a chat and some much-needed company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Retiring can be a huge change in a man's life. There is a risk of loneliness and social isolation which can cause anxiety and depression. The loss of a partner is another life event that can isolate a man where they need the support of others. Sheds provide a wealth of opportunity for men seeking interaction and community connection. In the 2024-25 budget, the Australian Men's Shed Association was provided with $6 million over two years to continue to support men's sheds across the country, deliver the National Shed Development Program and support the regional coordinators program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than 30 years, men's sheds have been improving the wellbeing and health of men by providing them with a shared community that they can contribute to and be supported by. In McEwen, we are spoiled with so many men's sheds that are committed to providing a place that promotes mental health and wellbeing as well as driving a strong connection with local communities. Last week, I took the opportunity to speak to quite a few of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kilmore men's shed is a great example. They have teamed up with a Melbourne university study that has been funded to provide dementia and Alzheimer's patients in a Kilmore high care facility with the possession of a trolley. The trolley allows them to have close by their beds items, trinkets and photos that reassure them in times of awareness of their memory loss. The members of the Kilmore District Men's Shed are looking forward to working on this project and, shortly, to seeing the outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Romsey Men's Shed have been working on the restoration of a 1925 Model T Ford gifted to the shed by local businessman Doug Newnham. This vehicle was sold new in Gisborne, originally. With the generous help of the Bendigo Community Bank, Romsey members are diligently working on its refurbishment, with the vehicle to be used for community events. This project has shown the depth of skills and knowledge at the local shed, from trade skills such as mechanics, joinery and bodywork right through to historical research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Woodend Men's Shed is a hive of activity and a shed that is proactive and forward thinking. In a drive to raise funds for their proposed new shed facility, they have sourced donated offcut timber from the neighbouring Black Forest Saw Mill. They've chopped it up as kindling and are selling bags of it at the local hardware stores. Open fires are a popular heating source in the Macedon Ranges. These kindling bags are inexpensive, and the Woodend shed receives a portion of the proceeds, with all the funds going towards their facility. This shed has tapped a community need to help it continue to be a driver for community connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the Whittlesea Men's Shed, a powerhouse example of connecting local community. In 2022 the principal of Arthurs Creek Primary School spoke to his grade 6s about a project they could leave at school at the end of their primary years. The kids came up with the idea of a buddy bench, a place where kids who feel alone can take a seat and other kids, seeing they need a friend, can stop and check in with them. The principal took their idea to the Rotary Club of Whittlesea, who approached the men's shed to make the bench. The rest, as they say, is history. The project is encouraging social connection at a grassroots level, in school playgrounds, and showing how community organisations can come together and work to bond communities. This is an excellent idea that has now been implemented in more local schools across the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look forward to more men's sheds taking the Whittlesea approach of looking to expand and create women's sheds, as the benefits can help members of our community. The men's sheds out in McEwen, like those in Diamond Creek, Hurstbridge and St Andrews, continue to work very hard in supporting their communities and supporting people who live alone in those areas. As I said, it's not all about woodwork and metalwork. There's a whole range of things that can happen in all the men's sheds, right across the community—including at Lancefield, where they work with the local primary school kids, teaching them basic skills in using hammers and bits of wood to create and build something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the men's sheds of McEwen and right across the nation, we thank you for the important work you do in ensuring social connection and supporting men's health and wellbeing. Now is as good a time as any to say, 'Send him down to the shed.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I'm happy to second the motion. I rise today to acknowledge the 2024 Men's Shed Week, a celebration of a remarkable establishment that has fostered social connection and community development and improved mental health outcomes for men all across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men's sheds have become so much more than a place to tinker or build. They are places of mateship, where men from all walks of life can come together to share skills, stories and companionship over a cup of tea or coffee and often some very nice homemade biscuits. These men's sheds offer a sense of belonging and purpose, particularly for men who may otherwise feel isolated. Whether working with wood, metal or other materials, these shared passions build more than just creative pieces; they build confidence and a sense of self. In an era where we hear all too frequently about mental health challenges in our community, men's sheds stand as a quiet yet powerful institution to support men's mental and emotional health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayo is home to nearly 20 men's sheds, including: Aldgate Men's Shed; Kingscote Men's Shed; Lobethal and District Shedmen; Macclesfield Men's Shed; Lakeside Men's Shed @ Milang; Laratinga Community Shed; Victor Harbour Men's Shed; Yankalilla and Districts Community Men's Shed; Coorong Quays Boat Shed—I was there just recently; Armfield Slip and Boatshed—they specialise in doing a lot of work around ships and boats, and they're right on the water Goolwa; the Hut Community Shed; Strathalbyn Wood Craft Group; Blackwood Hills Men's Shed; the Red Shed; the Green Shed at Gumeracha; the Aldinga Bay Community Shed; and the Kersbrook Shed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sheds play a vital role for many in our community but particularly for men when they navigate the transition from paid work to retirement or from farm life to town life or when they downsize to a retirement village and no longer have their own beloved shed. In my time as the member for Mayo I have been honoured to enter many of these sacred places, share a cuppa and talk to the men about what they are creating. As I said, I recently visited Coorong Quays Boat Shed, where a dedicated group of members with a shared passion for boat restoration gather weekly to work collaboratively on a range of projects. This shed is just one of so many across my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do everything we can in this place to continue to provide these groups with the financial resources to sustain their growth and development so that future generations can also experience the benefit of that supportive network. I know, talking with my men's shed, who are doing the Bunnings sausage sizzle just to cover the cost of materials and keep the lights on, that we have so many organisations in our community that are very generous with the men's sheds, donating excess stock they may have. They want to provide a quality place. They are always looking to expand. Look at the Victor Harbour men's shed. That's a massive shed. We were able to get funding for that a few years ago, but I can tell you it is full to the brim. As my husband says, you can never have a big enough shed. That is correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I greatly value the men's sheds in my community. They are wonderful, welcoming places and safe places for men to come together and connect and make new friendships, all the while working side by side and building positive and good mental health and connections to each other. Long live men's sheds.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I would like to thank the member for McEwen for this motion about Men's Shed Week last week. I told him that I wouldn't mention the line 'giving them a flogging'. But I am happy to talk about something a bit more important, which is men's sheds. That's not least because I am retiring from politics at the next election and I might need to join a men's shed myself. I know my wife will definitely want me out of the house!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In all seriousness, last week was Men's Shed Week. I think it is an important occasion to recognise here in a great bipartisan way. Moreton has some fantastic men's sheds. There's the Yeronga men's shed. There are two right on the border at Oxley, including the St John's men's shed. All these sheds are supported by the Australian Men's Shed Association, AMSA, the umbrella organisation for more than 1,200 community sheds peppered throughout the country. More than 50,000 Aussie blokes go to a men's shed for lots of good reasons. Men's sheds are a place where men go to talk, as AMSA says, shoulder to shoulder. Men go there to work and do good for their local communities, to reconnect and to make new friendships. They give participants a sense of purpose and have a critical role in bolstering mental health. Judging from my experience when I go to men's sheds, if the government ever needs good policy advice every MP should run their ideas past their men's shed first. They are better than a gang of prosecuting QCs; they will interrogate you about everything! They are wonderful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research shows us that one in five older Australians experience loneliness. A Monash University study indicated that lonely Australians aged 65 and over can feel abandoned and rejected. They also face an increased risk of dementia and cardiovascular disease, amongst other conditions. AMSA recognise that many men do not feel comfortable talking about their feelings and emotions. Many don't recognise that these things affect their wellbeing and health. They prefer to talk about the footy. AMSA lists a range of challenges that men face that may cause isolation, loneliness and depression, such as relationship breakdown; retrenchment or early retirement from a job; the loss of children or grandchildren following divorces; and physical or mental illness. These are difficult to deal with on your own. Joining a men's shed assists with being productive, contributing to your community, connecting with friends and maintaining an active body and mind—all factors that help your wellbeing. The companionship offered by men's sheds works against the detrimental effects of loneliness and significant life events, such as those just mentioned, and helps to maintain wellbeing and the overall quality of life for participants. As AMSA says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Men's Shed movement has become one of the most powerful tools in addressing health and wellbeing, helping men to once again become valued &amp; productive members of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AMSA is funded by the Department of Health and Aged Care and has a serious focus on men's health. They've collaborated with different stakeholders to produce a range of resources and health and wellbeing programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mike, from the Sunnybank District Community Men's Shed, backed up the importance of the shed for its members. Some men, Mike said, attend to work on the tools, while others enjoy the company of other people and the comradery it offers. The Sunnybank men's shed is open for their 130 members five days a week from 8 am to noon-ish. Sunnybank, like the other sheds in my area, have impressed me with their support for men seeking assistance with mental health issues. They provide a safe and welcoming space where men can come together to talk, develop useful skills and help each other. These simple actions help prevent healthcare issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men's sheds have a very positive impact on local communities. Over the years, their members have created desks, toys and furniture for residential aged care, for local kindergartens, for schools and for not-for-profit organisations. They do excellent sausage sizzles too. I've seen the community spirit and mateship in action and up close for 17 years. Men's sheds across the country vary greatly in what they offer. In addition to building furniture, they may fix machinery, offer gardening, or teach computer skills or cooking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government recognised the many benefits of men's sheds and, in the May budget, committed $6 million over two years to support them to continue and flourish. This builds on nearly $27 million of federal government funding since 2011—so it's bipartisan. The latest round will support the regional coordinators program, health and wellbeing event, shed improvements and tools and equipment. Long live our men's sheds.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I too support the member from McEwen's motion on supporting men's sheds. I would like to acknowledge the bipartisan support across all flavours of politics in support of the men's shed movement across Australia. Last week was Men's Shed Week, led by the Australian Men's Shed Association, with this year's theme being 'Send him down to the Shed'. The theme acknowledged that most men are introduced to men's sheds by somebody else, which reconnects men with community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men's sheds play a vital role in preventing social isolation and mental ill health. They offer thousands of men of all ages a safe and friendly environment where they can work on meaningful projects while building strong social connections. From Biggenden to Boyne-Tannum, Gayndah to Gracemere, Calliope to the Callide Valley and Moore Park Beach to Mount Morgan, there are men's sheds all over the Flynn electorate in Central Queensland that do a fantastic job in their local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been very pleased to be able to support the men's sheds over the years with various federal government grants, including $2,850 for the Calliope River Men's Shed for a log splitter, $5,000 for the Gracemere Men's Shed for a spindle moulder and dust extractor, $4,300 to the Taroom Men's Shed for a mobile evaporative cooler for the workshop and $12,500 for the Gladstone Men's Shed for two water tanks and new fencing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The men's shed movement has become one of the most powerful tools in addressing health and wellbeing, helping men to once again become valued and productive members of our community. The Australian Men's Shed Association perfectly describe the critical role of men's sheds and their positive impact in the communities: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Most men have learned from our culture that they don't talk about feelings and emotions and many do not take an interest in their own health and wellbeing.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably because of this, many men are less healthy than women. They drink more, they take more risks and they suffer more from isolation, loneliness and depression. Relationship breakdown, retrenchment or early retirement from a job, loss of children following a divorce, and physical or mental illness are just some of the problems that men may find difficult to deal with on their own. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good health is based on many factors, including feeling good about yourself, being productive, contributing to your community, connecting with friends and maintaining an active body and mind. Becoming a member of a men's shed provides a safe and busy environment where men can find many of these things in an atmosphere of old-fashioned mateship and, importantly, there is no pressure. Men can just come and have a yarn or a cup of tea if that's all they want and all they're looking for. Members of men's sheds come from all walks of life. The bond that unites them is that they are men with time on their hands who would like to do something meaningful with that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good men's shed has a management committee that has developed a safe and happy environment where men are welcome to work on community projects, specific men's sheds projects or a project of their own choice in their own time where the only must is to observe a safe working practice in all the spirit of mateship. The men's shed movement has now become one of the most powerful tools in addressing the wellbeing and helping of men to once again become valued and productive members of our community. That exactly captures what the men's shed movement is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I didn't agree with much in the recent budget, I strongly agree with, support and acknowledge the federal government's ongoing support for the Australian Men's Shed Association and the commitment in the 2024-25 budget to provide $6 million over two years to support the men's shed movement across Australia. This will provide funding for health and wellbeing events, shed improvements, tools, equipment and automated external defibrillators. I would also like to see this funding increased and be ongoing to support men's sheds and their growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to conclude by saying that I'm proud to support men's sheds across this country. I thank them for the invaluable work that they do in their local communities across Australia. With over 1,300 men's sheds across Australia and over 50,000 Australians participating in men's sheds, this is a terrific achievement. I look forward to seeing these numbers grow into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:02</span>):  I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate an initiative that is quietly but powerfully transforming the lives of many men across Australia: the men's sheds. The origin of men's sheds are deeply tied to Australian culture. The backyard shed has long been a symbol of refuge, a place for men to unwind and escape the pressures of daily life. However, as more people move into smaller homes and retirement villages, the classic backyard shed is disappearing. In response, community sheds have sprung up across Australia, providing a shared space where men can continue to do what they've always done: build things, fix things and create things, whilst forming meaningful connections with others. These grassroots community spaces provide a welcoming environment where people can come together, sharing experiences and developing friendships. They offer more than just a space to tinker with tools or work on projects; they are vital hubs for social connection, emotional wellbeing and even health promotion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of men's sheds go beyond giving men a space to escape. They offer a unique opportunity to address several key determinants of health, such as reducing social isolation, boosting self-esteem and fostering a sense of purpose. Research has shown that these social connections are linked to improved mental and physical health outcomes. In fact, studies have demonstrated that men who maintain strong social ties live longer, healthier lives. While many sheds focus on hands-on activities, like woodworking or machinery repair, the sheds also offer opportunities for learning new skills, sharing health information and even providing direct health services. The informal peer based environment of the shed encourages men to open up about health issues in ways that they may not feel comfortable doing in traditional health settings. Here, men can discuss their experiences with health, learn from each other and even engage in programs designed to promote healthier lifestyles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes men's sheds particularly effective is that they meet men where they are, both literally and figuratively. They offer a practical hands-on environment where learning is done through doing, which resonates with men who may not engage with more formal education or health promotion programs. The shed is not just a place to fix things; it's a place to build relationships, gain knowledge and restore a sense of self-worth. As we celebrate Men's Shed Week it is essential to recognise the important role that these sheds play in addressing the broader issue of men's health in Australia. With proper support, these spaces could serve as a cornerstone for health promotion, especially for those men who are least likely to engage with traditional healthcare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to know that the Albanese Labor government's ongoing support of the Australian Men's Shed Association continues to be strong, with a commitment in the 2024-25 budget to provide over $6 million to support men's sheds across the country. This funding will go towards health and wellbeing events, shed improvements, tools and equipment, as well as automated defibrillators and ensuring that these essential community spaces are well equipped to serve their members.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my local community of Pearce we are so fortunate to have four men's sheds: Quinns Men's Shed, Yanchep Community Men's Shed, Wanneroo Community Men's Shed and Northern Suburbs Men's Shed. These sheds are more than just workshops. They are lifelines for many men in our area, offering them a place to belong, to share and to thrive. Men's sheds have the potential to reach men who are socially isolated or who are dealing with loss of identity after retirement or struggling with their mental health. By offering them a space to reconnect with themselves and their community, we are giving them the tools and the time to build objects but also to rebuild their lives. Men's sheds are a place of transformation. They are spaces that promote not just physical activity but also mental, emotional and social wellbeing, and the Albanese Labor government is committed to ensuring that they continue to grow and thrive for future generations. We recognise that men's sheds are a vital avenue for improving men's health and wellbeing, and we will always ensure that they are always integrated into state and national health policies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  This week is Men's Shed Week, and the theme of this year is 'Send him to the Shed'. Did you know that there are more men's sheds in Australia than there are Macca's restaurants? There are over 1,300 of them. Good health is based on many factors, including feeling good about yourself, being productive, contributing to your community, connecting with friends and maintaining an active body and mind. Becoming a member of a men's shed provides a safe and productive environment where men can find many of these things. It's all about being mates and doing something meaningful with your time. There are over 50,000 Australian men who are involved with a men's shed. Because of this, the men's shed movement has become one of the most powerful tools in addressing health and wellbeing and helping men reconnect with their communities as valued and productive members. Men's sheds are important parts of our community, especially in the Hunter, and I will always support them whenever I can and however I can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is filled with so many incredible men's sheds. We have the Aberdeen Men's Shed, Bonnells Bay Men's Shed, Branxton-Greta Men's Shed, Cardiff Edgeworth Men's Shed, Cessnock Men's Shed and Garden, Cooranbong Men's Shed, Denman and District Men's Shed, Lake Macquarie Classic Boatshed, Muswellbrook Men's Shed, Singleton Men's Shed, South Lakes Men's Shed, Toronto Men's Shed and, finally, Wangi Men's Shed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since becoming the member for Hunter, I've been lucky enough to visit lots of men's sheds across my electorate, and it's always great to spend time with the blokes involved. The team at Cessnock Men's Shed and Garden do amazing work restoring things like old rocking horses and building new things like birds' nesting boxes. They also have an amazing garden where they grow their own fruit and veggies. The most important part of this garden is the blue tree, which serves as a reminder that it's okay to not be okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visited the Singleton Men's Shed, I picked up a jar of the famous men's shed tomato relish from Gerry. Gerry and the team at the Singleton Men's Shed make and sell tomato relish, with all the proceeds going to support local Cancer Council NSW appeals and Cancer Council Australia appeals. So far, they have raised $4,000 and more. Well done, guys. That's an amazing effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guys at the Muswellbrook Men's Shed are doing great work making a variety of local products for council and also the mine sites in the area. They also recycle all the cans and bottles from a number of local clubs, businesses and residents. When I visited, I had the pleasure of drawing the meat raffle. I didn't win anything, unfortunately, but it was a great day with the guys, who are always having a laugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The men's shed in Denman is a very valuable part of the community in Denman. They play an important role by helping to restore the old items for the heritage village which helps to preserve some of the history of the town. They also supply habitat boxes for the mines and build garden furniture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wangi Men's Shed have recently finished restoring an old fire engine that they will be using around Christmas time. I've seen the project, and it's very cool; I can tell you that. I'm sure it will bring so much joy to the community when they see it out and about. They also have an annual monster garage sale where people can go and buy some very impressive woodwork and metalwork products that the men have made. So get out there and check it out. It's on 12 October at the Wangi Men's Shed. Make sure you get out there and see them. It's great to see local community groups enjoying themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our men's sheds do so much to help the mental health of local men, and they do amazing work for so many other community organisations and charities. Whenever I visit, I enjoy the chats, I enjoy getting involved with their projects, I certainly enjoy the sausage sizzle, and I enjoy how much they generally take the piss out of me as well. So, if you're looking for a way to spend your spare time, go and join your local men's shed and get involved. You won't regret it. There's always something to do at a men's shed. There's lots to build and lots of projects to get involved with. But the best part is being able to make new mates and have a chat and a laugh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As men, we don't always look after ourselves the way we should and we don't always talk about the things that are bothering us. But getting involved with your local men's shed, meeting people from all walks of life and having a good conversation and a good time is a perfect way to shed the load. So to all the men out there and all the partners of the blokes out there: make sure you get on to them and send them down to the shed.</span>

                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise to support the motion to recognise the vital service that men's sheds provide nationally. These remarkable organisations form one of Australia's largest community development networks, with around 1,300 men's sheds across the country, engaging over 50,000 Aussie blokes. Just last week, we celebrated Men's Shed Week, led by the Australian Men's Shed Association. This year's theme, 'Send him down to the Shed', highlights a significant truth: most men are introduced to a shed by someone else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we can all agree, on both sides of the House, that men's involvement in their local shed invariably leads to improved mental health outcomes. Participants report increased self-esteem, greater mental health awareness and the destigmatisation of issues that many men struggle with alone. The sheds foster a positive community outlook, reinforcing that long-cherished spirit of Aussie mateship. For many, these meetings are not just gatherings; they are, quite simply, literally lifelines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving the mental health of Australian men is crucial. It is well known that men aged 85 years and older have the highest suicide rates in Australia. This is heartbreaking. This is an alarming statistic, and community organisations like men's sheds are the key to tackling challenges head on. They offer support, camaraderie and a chance to reconnect in ways that many men otherwise miss out on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always enjoy visiting the many men's sheds in my electorate, and I make it a priority to visit as often as I can. Recent trips have taken me to Bindoon, Cervantes, Gin Gin and Wundowie, to name a few. I applaud the Cervantes Community Men's Shed for its recent move towards inclusivity by involving women in its activities. It's a modern positive step forward, and I just want to note that the Country Women's Association recently has taken a leaf out of their book by inviting men to participate as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do they do in men's sheds? Well, we know it's about the friendship and the camaraderie, but they're also creating breadboards and upcycling used craypot rope, as they do in Cervantes, and making rocking horses et cetera. But their aim, ultimately, is to support their community and those who are in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Participation in men's sheds is at an all-time high, with many of them looking to expand. Of course, this is such fantastic news. However, it does come with its own challenges. More government support and funding is needed to achieve these goals, and I commend the government for its support of the men's shed movement and committing over $6 million. I also want to acknowledge the coalition's legacy of funding men's sheds during our time, and long may we continue to support men's sheds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time is of the essence now, so I want to say I wholeheartedly support this motion. I encourage the continuation and expansion of support for our men's sheds. This support will ensure they have the resources they need to thrive and keep making a tangible difference to the lives of our Australian men, who matter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  For decades, men have retreated to the sanctuary of their back sheds or man caves for some time out to tinker on their latest project or to share a few laughs with their mates. We all know that male friendships are critical to men's health and overall wellbeing, whether that's talking to a neighbour over the back fence, playing a game of footy at the park or dipping a line in with a mate. So, when the first men's shed was formed 31 years ago, the concept took off around the country. Now we have more than 1,300 sheds across Australia, and I'm proud to say that 21 of these are in my electorate of Gilmore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, I've supported my local men's sheds with numerous grants to enable members to support each other and to continue the important work they do in our communities. Since 2011, almost $30 million in federal funding has been allocated to the Australian Men's Shed Association to provide general support, resources and activities to men's sheds around the nation and to manage the National Shed Development Program. The Australian government recognises the importance of men's sheds as places where men can find social support and friendship while being engaged in meaningful activities that help them maintain good mental and physical wellbeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, too, acknowledge that men's sheds lead to increased self-esteem and improved mental health outcomes for men who may be feeling lonely, depressed or socially isolated. This is why I fully support the government's commitment in the 2024-25 budget to provide $6 million over two years to support the association. I really enjoy popping along to my local men's sheds and seeing what they're up to. You never know what you'll find or what they'll be working on. One day, they'll be creating spectacular timber jewellery boxes and furniture, which they sell at markets to raise money for their programs, and the next they'll be planting a garden or running a cooking class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no end to the variety of activities that are carried out in men's sheds, led by the members, who bring a wealth of skills and knowledge to share with their mates. Activities aren't confined within the shed walls. The members enjoy time out together. Whether touring a local winery, a bus trip to the footy or riding the rails on a historic steam train ride, these excursions get men out of the house, increase their self-esteem and, importantly, lay the foundations for new hobbies and new friendships. Men's Shed is one of Australia's largest community development organisations, and the community spirit they foster is astounding. I love that, if a local charity school or community group needs a hand, the men's shed members always have their tools at the ready. Whether it's a cubby house or an insect home for a preschool, garden furniture for an aged-care facility or a memorial seat in a local park, the members always step up with pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great thing about men's sheds is they're all different. Living on the South Coast, surrounded by bushland, beaches and forests, the environment is at the top of the list for many of our local men's sheds. One group builds minor bird traps, while another makes nesting boxes for birds and possums. As well as providing a safe place for men of all ages, from all backgrounds and from all walks of life to come together, men's sheds are playing an increasingly valuable role in protecting our environment and supporting other community organisations. That's why it's so important for this government to continue to support them and to provide funding for health and wellbeing events, shed improvements, tools and equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget funds will also provide automated external defibrillators for men's sheds. The addition of a defib could save the life of a member or visitor in the event of a cardiac arrest. These will be particularly welcomed in my electorate, where the sheds are located in villages some distance from a hospital or ambulance station. On Saturday, I bumped into my local Culburra Beach and District Men's Shed group, who were conducting a fundraising sausage sizzle. One member summed up what he loved most about the organisation. He said, 'They're a great bunch of blokes with great ideas and a willingness to help people wherever they can.' Today, I want to give a huge shout-out to all of our men's sheds and give special thanks to the 21 awesome sheds in Gilmore.</span>

I've been here for eight years, the same as the member for Macquarie, and I don't think I've ever seen before a motion that has been moved in this place with bipartisan support. Normally these motions are an opportunity for the main parties to butt heads, but that is not the occasion tonight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask why I am here talking about Tibetans when there are so many other issues affecting Australian families. I'm very lucky, as the member for Fisher, to represent some wonderful people from all corners of the world. We are home to the Chenrezig Institute, a home for Tibetan Buddhist monks, nuns, students and interested travellers alike. I rise to speak on behalf of them and their loved ones and I'm very pleased to see that there is a very strong show of the Tibetan community here in the chamber tonight. I rise to speak on behalf of Tsering, Tenzin, Samdhong and the many Tibetan representatives here today. I rise to speak because I can't stay silent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single day, the number of victims of the Chinese communist regime grows. For seven decades, the people of Tibet, including Tibetan Buddhists, have borne the brunt of the most barbaric oppression. Even today we see children abducted, trafficked and forced into boarding schools which strip them of their cultural, religious and ethnic identity. They are taught that Tibet has long been part of China and a rejection of China's brutal takeover in the 1950s. This systematic cultural assimilation seeks to crush Tibetans' identity, their culture and their religion. We see people of faith, democracy activists and minority groups forced into labour camps where they are beaten, tortured and enslaved. Alongside others, the Tibetan people are forced into a state sponsored system of organ trafficking. And now, while the CCP seeks to crush Tibetan identity and aspiration, we see the most basic tenets of the Tibetan Buddhist faith under fire. That includes Tibetans' right to political and religious self-determination when it comes to selecting the eventual successor of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, the Chinese Communist Party are not content with simply trying to wipe out the culture of Tibet and Tibetans; they also want to remove their religious background. The CCP want to control who will become the successor to the Dalai Lama. We are a strong democracy, and I am so incredibly proud to be standing tonight and to see that there is bipartisan support on this because if we as democracy-loving people in Australia don't stand up for the people of Tibet, who will? If we don't stand up for them tonight, when will that happen? We cannot allow a whole group of people to lose their culture, their religion and their identity. That cannot happen on our watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not shy away from calling out the Chinese Communist Party tonight. We must speak up on behalf of the people of Tibet and the growing number of victims of the CCP. We all know that these actions are not constrained. These abuses of human and civil rights are not constrained just to the people of Tibet; this also applies to the Uighurs. It is incredibly important, and I am so pleased that the members for Macquarie, Fraser and Lyne will also speak on this issue. It's a matter of great pride that Australians can take this stance here tonight.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I second the motion. Today is Tibet Lobby Day. It's a day when the Australian Tibetan community come to parliament to share their personal stories and the experiences of family and friends suffering oppression in Tibet by the actions of the Chinese government. Among them here today have been several Blue Mountains residents, including Kunchok and his son Tenzin. Kunchok's own story is one that speaks to the suppression of Tibetan religious expression, because he was a Tibetan Buddhist monk and escaped after doing that difficult route from Lhasa through the Himalayas to Dharamshala in India before coming to Australia as a refugee. Now he and his family make an enormous contribution to the growing local Tibetan community. They practise their culture and language and they share that with us in the Blue Mountains. Along with so many of the Tibetan political or religious exiles who have come to Australia as part of our refugee programs, we are lucky to have such resilient people. I say the same for those who remain in Dharamshala, which I led a delegation to last year to meet with the Tibetan government in exile and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the opportunity, working with my colleague the member for Fisher, to speak in support of the people of Tibet in the face of oppression and persecution, particularly on a day when they are all here and have shared their stories in this parliament. I remain gravely concerned about reports detailing China's assimilationist policies, including forced labour transfer programs and the coerced separation of Tibetan children from their families through state-run boarding schools, the detention of Tibetans for peaceful expression of political views and the use of excessive security measures against Tibetans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently we saw a range of UN special rapporteurs write about the widespread crackdown on Tibetan individuals peacefully expressing their opposition to the construction of the Kamtok hydroelectric power plant, which would result in the forced displacement and relocation of Tibetans living along the Drichu River from their ancestral villages. The rapporteurs also wrote about the irreversible destruction of important cultural and religious sites as well as irreversible or significant environmental, biodiversity and climate impact. What's worse is that there have been alleged violations and abuse of human rights of Tibetan communities, leaders and religious figures living in the surrounding areas of the Kamtok dam's project site who do not appear to have been consulted in a meaningful way and whose free, prior and informed consent has not been obtained. This project directly affects them and will have an irreversible impact on many of their human rights; in particular, their cultural right to maintain their ways of life, to access and enjoy heritage and to exercise their religious and cultural practices as well as their rights to land, livelihoods, adequate housing and a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. This is what Tibetans face in their homeland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned, as are the Australian government and my colleagues, about the recent reprisals, use of force, arbitrary arrests and detention of hundreds of Tibetans, which appears to be directly related to their legitimate exercising of their freedom of opinion, expression, association and peaceful assembly and to their claims for respect for their rights to information and to meaningful participation in public affairs, including by raising concerns and criticisms about government projects. These sorts of incidents underscore the alarming reality for people living in Tibet who face similar allegations and consequences for exercising their fundamental rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the calls of the Australian government and other governments for China to re-engage with the representatives of the 14th Dalai Lama to establish genuine autonomy for Tibetans within China. Along with my parliamentary colleagues here, I urge the Chinese authorities to release the Panchen Lama. We don't want to see any country interfere in the selection of the next Dalai Lama. At the Universal Periodic Review of China, the Australian government called on China to repeal legislation and cease practices which discriminate against Tibetans. I support those calls. As you see demonstrated here, we will continue to be a loud voice for the people of Tibet and Tibetans in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise in support of the motion raised by the member for Fisher and reinforce the words of the member for Macquarie. Since the invasion of Tibet in 1950 and 1951, things haven't changed, and time doesn't right the essential wrong. The Communist Party of China continues to suppress religion, tradition, Tibetan and Buddhist religious practice and language, and the Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1959 and remains in exile with a government in exile. The CCP continues to ban images of the Dalai Lama and suppresses religious practice. It has banned political expression and is suppressing cultural identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations has identified at least one million children in forced assimilation schools, separated forcibly from their parents on a regular basis of increasing duration as they go from early years, 3 and 4, up to their teenage years and are indoctrinated in Chinese culture to try to wash away their Tibetan and Buddhist heritage. Why is China so afraid of Tibet? Why are they suppressing this? Is it the water that they hope to dam and get into China? Is it the minerals? Is it the practice of forced and illegal organ harvesting and trading? Forced assimilation, summary arrest, extrajudicial killings and torture of prisoners, as well as shooting any Tibetans that try to escape across the border, have all been documented. This really does reflect badly on China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has made recommendations to have the Chinese government repeal all the restrictive legislation that suppresses human rights and encourages more abuse. Suppressing a beautiful culture and a religion makes China look weak. If China were clever, they would remove all these prohibitions and let cultural diversity exist in their nation. There are many other cultures that they are suppressing. Australia is stronger for our heritage of many refugees and willing settlers who have come from all corners of the globe to flourish. Don't be afraid, China. You're a big nation now. You need to stop all these suppressions of Tibetan culture, their human and political rights and their freedom of expression, association and religious practice. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  I reiterate the member for Fisher's contribution in saying that it is unusual to have a motion that is supported by both the major parties, and I will add that this is a motion that I think is supported right across the parliament. We have former Greens senator Janet Rice here. We have a member of the Independent part of the parliament here, and I know that there are many Independent members of the parliament who support this. So this is a motion that has support right across this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also quite unusual to have the gallery packed in the Federation Chamber. I want to acknowledge all of the people here, including Mr Karma Singey and all of the monks and all of the people from the community who have come here. It reflects how important this issue is that we have a packed public gallery here, and it makes today's discussion on this very important issue all the more meaningful. In acknowledging the people who are here today, I also acknowledge that a number of the people in the gallery visited me in a delegation today in my office. I found the young people in particular, who are here championing these issues, so eloquent, thoughtful and powerful, and I found myself to have been educated today on so many aspects of these important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my own electorate has a very significant Tibetan community. I speak to the people in Fraser and Melbourne's broader west from the Tibetan community. I want to reiterate the comments of earlier speakers in that I've read with great concern reports of assimilationist policies by the Chinese government. The term 'assimilationist' is such a euphemism. It doesn't really tell what's going on. It doesn't reflect the human rights abuses and the oppression. It doesn't reflect the fact that the lives of individuals, families and communities are being torn apart. I think we really do need to speak to the heart of this issue, as other speakers have done. We're talking about human rights abuses. We're talking about the abuses of individuals, young people, families and communities. That's why it's important that this motion brings this matter to the fore in a cross-party way and that we all stand as one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the boarding schools, which were again raised with me by the delegation that visited me today. These are people who have direct experience of family members having to attend the schools. Young people, people under the age of 10, are not allowed to speak their own language and are not allowed to celebrate, understand or learn their own culture. This is an insidious thing to do to young people, quite apart from the fact that young people are being separated from their families for extended periods of time, and all the psychological trauma that involves. That is something that this motion usefully calls out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Macquarie pointed out, on 8 July UN rapporteurs wrote that there had been a widespread crackdown on Tibetans peacefully opposing the construction of the Kamtok hydroelectric power plant. That's an important event in and of itself. That kind of crackdown is a terrible thing, and I think it's important to note that, but it's a reflection of a wider series of crackdowns that are going on. It's a reflection of a wider suppression of the expression of people's views. It's a very important example, but it's one of many that the community is experiencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I point out, as earlier speakers have done, that there is religious suppression going on. People are not allowed to practice their religion. The carrying of the Dalai Lama's image has been banned. There have been arrests and imprisonment of people who have merely carried or celebrated that image. As earlier speakers have pointed out, it is quite remarkable that the Chinese Communist Party regime is trying to intervene in the succession of the Dalai Lama. That is quite a remarkable intervention in a process that should be all about faith, religion and culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I thank the mover and the seconder of this motion. I'm very pleased to be able to speak tonight in favour of this. Thank you so much to the delegation, to the leaders who are here and to the young people who are here. I very much hope that this motion raises the profile of this very important issue.</span>
