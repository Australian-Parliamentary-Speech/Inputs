         â€”The disgraceful and totally unjustifiable episode that occurred yesterday afternoon in this Parliament House is one of the most shameful in this nation's history. I am sure I speak for members on both sides of this House when I say that the opportunity for law-abiding citizens to express by peaceful protest, by orderly and non-violent demonstration or by other acceptable means their dissent from decisions made by governments is acknowledged as one of the fundamental privileges in a free and democratic society. However, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure it is a privilege that is not abused.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What happened in this place yesterday should never have happened. Those responsible for transforming what was meant to be a well&amp;hyphen;organised demonstration into the ugly and violent display that ultimately eventuated deserve the strongest condemnation. Members should be aware that every endeavour had been made to ensure that this pre-budget
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         protest activity would proceed in an acceptable and reasonable manner. There were a number of meetings between Parliament House security authorities, the police and representatives of the demonstrators prior to yesterday's rally and it had been hoped that these discussions would assist in promoting peaceful protest action.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Briefly, by way of background, on 4 July the ACT Trades and Labour Council wrote to the President and me about a rally to be staged at Parliament House on Monday, 19 August and requested permission to conduct a march around the building. We responded to that request on 24 July. We approved the protest and the march around the building subject to the following conditions: that the march not start earlier than 1.35 p.m. and be completed by 2.25 p.m.; that marshals be appointed and clearly identified to cooperate with the police in managing the march to ensure minimal disruption to traffic flows and access to the building for emergency and other vehicles; that all efforts be made by participants in cooperation with marshals and the police to ensure that roadways leading from Parliament Drive to the building and entrances to the underground car parks remain unobstructed so as not to prevent the free movement of vehicles and people in and out of Parliament House; and that the march be contained to Parliament Drive.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         There were subsequent discussions with representatives of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Aboriginal community. All concerned were advised of the approved march and agreed to contain their activities to the authorised event. Most regrettably, this agreement was broken and the conditions were not adhered to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The protest rally remained peaceful until about 12.20 p.m. when a separate group of marchers entered the parliamentary precincts. This group refused to accept police direction, forced a breach in the police lines and ran towards the main entrance of Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was apparent that some of these demonstrators were affected by alcohol. This group was supported by participants from the more general demonstration who were incited to join those involved in riotous behaviour by a speaker from the official platform.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Police formed a protective line along the perimeter of the Great Verandah, which was subsequently forced back to the main doors. The police line was withdrawn from this area due to the level of violence being experienced by officers and then redeployed to an area inside the front doors in support of parliamentary security personnel. This deployment stabilised the situation for a short period. However, demonstrators using increasing force broke through the first line of doors.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Once inside this area, demonstrators used weapons including a large hammer, wheel brace, steel trolley and stanchion torn from the external doors to break open the internal doors. Simultaneously, a second group of demonstrators used other weapons to break into the Parliament House shop but were held at the internal doors. The shop was ransacked by demonstrators and major damage was caused by persons who subsequently occupied the area. After some two hours, the demonstrators were finally repelled from Parliament House and driven back onto the forecourt area and, shortly afterwards, dispersed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to the events which took place at the front entrance to the building, incidents also occurred on the Members Terrace, the roof of the Great Verandah and the Queens Terrace. There were 197 Australian Federal
         <break page="3222" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Police on duty at the start of the demonstration in addition to the Australian Protective Service officers and parliamentary security personnel. A further 60 Australian Federal Police reinforcements were called out under established contingency plans.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The outrageous events which took place yesterday resulted in not only financial but, more importantly and lamentably, human costs. So far about 90 personnel have reported injuries including lacerations, sprains and head and eye injuries and I understand one person remains in hospital. An initial indicative estimate of the damage to the forecourt and the foyer is upwards of $75,000. Emergency repairs have already been completed. The full extent of the looting and criminal damage which resulted from the occupation of the Parliament House shop has yet to be determined. Nine persons were arrested and have been charged with a variety of offences.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to commend the Parliament House security staff, Australian Protective Service officers and Australian Federal Police officers for ensuring that the building essentially remained secure. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of several other members of staff who were called upon unexpectedly to provide assistance in the initial stages of the disturbance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, I want to pay tribute to the Parliament House nurses. They performed in a most commendable and professional manner, treating approximately 40 injured personnel on the floor of the foyer. I also want to mention that the nurses were assisted in their efforts by our colleague Trish Worth and by an anonymous woman, presumably with nursing experience, who had been showing some American visitors around the Great Hall when the violence erupted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The President and I have asked parliamentary security officials to undertake an urgent and detailed review of the management of similar demonstrations in the future. We expect to receive this report shortly. I am aware that there has been some comment about reductions in parliamentary security staffing. These reductions essentially involved the closure of security points, and I do not
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          believe that they affected in any way the situation yesterday.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On a more positive note, I want to advise members that the Parliament House shop will reopen on Wednesday, 21 August as originally planned. I hope Bill Podmore and his staff will receive the support they deserve. They were stoic under enormous pressure yesterday, but they are already up and running with plans in hand for what will hopefully be a once only and never to be repeated giant sale of damaged stock.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I would also like to take this opportunity to remind members of their obligations in regard to visitors. Members are responsible for the conduct of any visitors they sign into Parliament House and this responsibility is not one that should be taken lightly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Finally, I want to apologise most sincerely to the Australian people and those from overseas who were visiting Parliament House and were unfortunately involved, inconvenienced, frightened or shocked in any way by this deplorable incident. To them I say: what you witnessed here yesterday is not typical of Australia or Australians, and I believe I speak for all my colleagues when I say we hope and pray it never will be.

On behalf of the government, I want to endorse everything you have said about what happened yesterday. It was very unpleasant, very unhappy and, for the people involvedâ€”the Australian Federal Police and Parliament House staff whose responsibility it was to deal with this incidentâ€”a very frightening experience and not an experience I would want any of them to go through again.

       I have already personally thanked on behalf of the governmentâ€”and I now do so on behalf of the people of Australiaâ€”all of the police officers and Parliament House staff. I had the opportunity of speaking to an assembly of them with you yesterday. It is appropriate on an occasion like this to remark again, and very forcefully, that although the police services of this country come in for a lot of criticism, and although in some areas that
       <break page="3223" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        criticism on occasions may be justified, they do have, on occasions when they are needed, an unenviable job. Nobody should ever diminish in any way the unpleasant character of police work. On occasions like this, when we all owe them something, we ought to remark on how much in debt the Australian community is to its police services.

There is absolutely no way any member of parliament or anybody of any decency or goodwill in the community can, under any circumstances at any time, condone, support or give comfort to violence in relation to any form of political activity in a democracyâ€”none.

       I am afraid, however, that, whilst this action was unique in its violence, it was not unique in its disruption. I have been in this parliament for 15 years now and I am afraid I have seen too frequent occasions such as this. When I was first elected to parliament we had the situation where demonstrators broke in as far as Kings Hall in Old Parliament House. We were sitting in question time, I recollect, and could hear the chanting from there. We have had more recent examples of that. Last year we had, of course, a blockade of the parliament which prevented services coming into the place. That affected the capacity of the parliament to perform its tasks.

       I recollect that at that time additional guidelines were delivered, based on that particular experience. Those guidelines, I understand, went towards creating exclusive arrangements to prevent people getting at the front doors of parliament. I would ask you to review those guidelines to see whether, in your judgment, in circumstances where a very large demonstration was likely to occur, all

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I would also ask you to review the security arrangements associated with parliament to see whether or not there is an adequate security staff in the parliament. We have to understand that, and we ought to have understood it for many years now because our experience has been such that these things do occur basically once every two or three years, and demonstrations out the front now are frequent.

       I do believe there is a requirement for a review of the security arrangements, including the strength of particular doors and approaches to the parliament. Other parliaments are, I believe, more realistic than we are as far as these matters are concerned.

       I think the tragedy caused by the lunatics who attacked the parliament, apart from the absolutely unacceptable consequences in terms of personal damage and damage to property, is that they drew attention away from what was, around the country, a peaceful and lawful demonstration by decent citizens asserting their rights democratically to express their concerns about the direction of government policy, about broken undertakings in relation to the budget and about broken undertakings in relation to industrial relations. Those are precisely the concerns of a large number of mainstream Australians.

       The parliament of Australia, however, needs to be prepared in case that situation emerges. It is not as though, as I said, this has not happened before. The parliament has been broken into. From time to time people have effectively heckled events in this chamber from the gallery. Mr Speaker, I do believe it is essential at this point of time that this matter does not pass, that this matter is looked into closely by you and any changes that need to be made get made.

Does the Prime Minister recall the coalition's promise before the last election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in terms of operating grants'? The Prime Minister will be aware of the announcement by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs on 9 August 1996 to, among other things, massively cut operating grants to universities. Is the Prime Minister also aware that the Vice Chancellor of Deakin University, Professor Geoff Wilson, described those decisions affecting universities as `the worst news the university system in this country has ever had'?

        Returning to the university package, I think the balance struck between increases in higher education charges and changes to the operating grants were very much fairer and more balanced than many people in the university sector had expected, and many people in the university sector, if they are publicly candid as they have been privately candid, will acknowledge that overall it is an extremely fair and balanced package and it ought to get the support of the Australian  people.

        As evidence of this campaign of misinformation which has been run by the ACTU and its affiliated unions and labour councils, I have here a document with a misnomerâ€”`Fact Sheet One'â€”put out by the Victorian Trades Hall Council. This, unfortunately, is typical of the propaganda that you are putting out and which you as a political party have been endorsing in the last few days. For example, this one is telling workers in capital letters `You lose' and that taken away will be your `rates of pay'. That is a blatant and absolute lie.

        For example, it says, `You lose basic human rights.' That is a basic lie. That is an absolute lie.

That is an outrageous and irresponsible statement to make. In fact, under the heading `Occupational health and safety'â€”occupation health and safety is basically a state matter anywayâ€”in terms of

The fact is that, in respect of superannuation, people's basic entitlements are protected by federal law, and that will continue to be case.

        By all means, there is a genuine debate about the government's workplace relations billâ€”of course there isâ€”and we have been preparedâ€”in fact, we have bent over backwardsâ€”to speak with the trade union leadership, with the rank and file, with the employers and with any members of the community who wanted to express a point of view. But, ultimately, we have a particular and higher duty, and that is an obligation to fulfil the promises that we made at the last election. In the workplace relations bill, we have before the parliament a legislative proposal which encapsulates the very promises we made to the Australian people.

        Let me state the facts, Mr Speaker, for the member for Hotham. He is the man who reduced apprenticeships and traineeships in this community, as a proportion of the work force, to the lowest number for three decades in 1995. He is the man who put young Australians on a merry-go-round of short-term training programs which, as the Working Nation evaluation shows, brought them right back again to the back of the unemployment queues. This is the man who told us all the way through last year that he was going to put $400 million into the new work opportunities program, which was going to be the best thing ever for getting young people into jobs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had the evaluation of new work opportunities, and that $400 million program was the most ineffective labour market program of the lot. Eight out of 10 were still unemployed at the end of their experience in your short-term training programs. Again and again, you misled people. In the

        That is the evaluation. Let me just give you a few simple facts which completely show your lack of grasp in this area. The first is that there is no change whatever to the wage payments for existing apprentices and trainees under the government's policy. That was what I said earlier.

        I have heard the claims. If you look at the overall level of Aboriginal funding, it is certainly very far from the truth. If you look at five key areas of Aboriginal fundingâ€”health, housing, CDEP, employment related programs and native title assistanceâ€”the fact is that over the four years of the forward estimates there will be very real increases in funding over what we have expected in the past.

In the area of community housing and infrastructure the funding will be $26 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In the CDEP program the funding will be $337 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In the programs being run by DEETYA there will be $147 million more in the next four years than in the last four years and in native title assistance there will be $172 million more in the next four years than in the last four years. In fact, over the whole range of indigenous assistance it will be going up $428 million over the next four years compared with what was spent in the last four years.

        To answer the minister's question specifically, in the last financial period running up to the Atlanta games, the government provided $950,000 to shooting sports. This was split in several different ways. Two&amp;hyphen;thirds of thatâ€”about $590,000â€”was provided under the Olympic athlete program for the preparation of Australian shooters for the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games. The OAP funding allows Australia's leading shooters to have the opportunity to take part in high level training and also international competition.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I might also point out that the proposal for funding for the next period will be dealt with by the Australian Sports Commission. What generally happens after each Olympic Games is that the Australian Sports Commission will review all of the performances of all the different teams and individuals, including Michael Diamond, Russell Mark and Deserie Huddleston. We will then make a judgment about which sports we believe will be in the best position to perform well in the 2000 Olympics. This is what happened after Barcelona.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The actual amount that may well be provided to shooting as we prepare for the 2000 games has not yet been determined but will be shortly. The board meets again in early September. Given the performance that they achieved in Atlanta, I would imagine that the level of support would be equivalent at least to the $950,000&amp;hyphen;odd that was provided for the preparation up to the Atlanta games.

        <break page="3231" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Games went to our shooters, but the total number of medals won was 41â€”nine gold, nine silver and 23 bronzeâ€”which saw Australia finish fifth in the overall medal tally. If we were to calculate it on a per capita basis against the United States, for example, they would have needed to win 589 medals when compared with the performance that Australia put in. They only won 101 medals. China would have had to have won some 2,263 medals. So Australia did very well indeed.

        The other point that needs to be made is that we finished well in advance of the medal tally we achieved in the Barcelona Olympics. We also saw 14 sports achieve medal wins compared with only nine in Barcelona. The very fundamental point that members should note is that there was a 33 per cent increase in the number of athletes who made it through to the finals or semi&amp;hyphen;finals.

        As we prepare for the 2000 Olympics, we can go forward with some confidence. Details of the budget announcements will be made tonight, but I was certainly pleased when the team returned home to Sydney to be welcomed by the Prime Minister by his indication of ongoing strong government support for the preparation of the Olympic team for the 2000 games. I am sure, like the Prime Minister and me, all members of the governmentâ€”and indeed I hope all members on the other side of the Houseâ€”would want us to extend on behalf of the parliament congratulations for a job well done and for the great pride that they brought to Australia. I might also indicate that during the time that I spent in Atlanta the Australian athletes were great ambassadors for Australia. The year 2000 looks very good, but it will require a cooperative and positive effort from everyone certainly in this chamber.

        I will explain for the member in plain, simple language how Australia's industrial relations system operates in respect of people who are trainees, juniors and apprentices. The Industrial Relations Commission has established award rates of pay for juniors, trainees and apprentices and it is those rates that are incorporated in our system.

Where there is an award rate of pay established for the particular traineeship, including a national training wage traineeship or an apprenticeship, then that rate will continue to apply whether they are employed under an award or a workplace agreement. As the minister said so comprehensively and completely, that is no change. Do you understand that? There is no change.

         â€”The next question is: why are we doing what we are doing in the bill? I will try to answer it very simply for you. The only area of change is for new traineeships and apprenticeships where currently there is no relevant training award rate of pay. That will generally occur because a new traineeship or apprenticeship with a different work training mix has been developed under the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. In other words, if the new arrangement you enter into has the same mix as the existing arrangements under the award, you get the same money.

Where they do vary the arrangements, the principle upon which the calculation is made for what people are paid is exactly the same principle which you have publicly endorsed, which the ACTU has endorsed and which the Industrial Relations Commission has ticked off. In fact, the member who asked the question acknowledged himself that this is the right principle in a debate that we had a couple of months ago.

        Let me complete with this point. The only reason we are doing thisâ€”if members opposite can understand thisâ€”is to actually try to give young people the chance of a traineeship which they were denied under your scheme. That is the reason we are doing it. I finish by complimenting the minister because, in the additional income support arrangements that he has made, he has provided real incentives and support. It gives a set of arrangements to support these industrial relations changes to the training arrangements which will see this as a very successful scheme. There are a lot of young Australians who will look forward to the passage of our legislation so that these benefits can also be available to them.

        Within the first few months of a coalition government being elected we have been pleased to be able to announce, in concert with the Queensland and New South Wales governments, a major upgrading of that road which will see $3.1 billion being spent over the next 10 years. Indeed, that allocation of funds will bring the Pacific Highway up to a reasonable standard and lead to a significant reduction in the loss of lives and in injuries such as have occurred over the last 10 years. I remind the House that in the past 10 years some 600 people have lost their lives on the Pacific Highway, in many cases due to the poor standard of that road.

        As the honourable member for Paterson points out, a detailed program was announced jointly by me and the New South Wales Minister for Roads last week. It includes a number of key projects, one of which is in the honourable member for Paterson's own electorate. He said to me as we campaigned prior to the last election, `If there is one thing we must do, it is to upgrade the Raymond Terrace road to bring it up to dual carriageway standard.' Because of that initiative that he brought forward and because of his persistent lobbying, I was pleased to be able to announce that the Raymond Terrace part of the Pacific Highway will be upgraded to dual carriageway.

        Of course, many other members from this side of the House have been campaigning to upgrade the Pacific Highway. Most of all, I draw to the attention of members of this House the efforts of the member for Cowper, who in his 12 years here has relentlessly campaigned to upgrade the Pacific Highway. He has been joined in more recent years by the honourable member for Lyne, who has done a lot of work to ensure that this program comes to fruition, and by the recently elected honourable member for Page, who has campaigned also for a long time, both as a state member and as federal member, to upgrade the Pacific Highway.

         It is something that this government promised to do when in opposition. It was launched by the Prime Minister in the honourable member for Richmond's electorate, for a particular reason, during the last election campaign: because the member for Richmond made such an issue of it in his campaigning in the 1993 and 1996 election campaigns. He will be very pleased with the announcement made last week. The Prime Minister made the commitment in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the last electionâ€”a commitment that we have delivered, as we have with so many of themâ€”to the Raymond Terrace section of the Pacific Highway being brought up to dual carriageway.

         The government is correcting a significant inequity in the previous government's funding arrangements because, throughout the tenure of the previous government, there was a huge unmet demand and there was no incentive given to universities to increase the number of HECS funded places. If a university failed to meet its target quota, it was penalised. If it created additional places through efficiencies, through meeting the demands of niche markets, there was no additional reward.

         Under the new decisions of this government, universities will be able to create additional HECS funded places over and above the agreed targets.

The government has allowed for funding for those additional places in the budget.

          One of the major strategic aims of the government's higher education statement was to give the universities the flexibility to plan for the future, which they did not have under the previous government. Amongst the advantages of this flexibility will be the fact that they will not only be able to offer additional HECS places but also, when they have filled their HECS quota, be able to offer additional fee&amp;hyphen;paying places to Australian students.

          That government had a concept of equity under which it was fair that Australian students should not have equal rights with overseas students to access Australian universities. This government will provide Australian students with that right. The consequence of thatâ€”this is something that the other side should listen to very carefully, and I want them all to hear thisâ€”is that, if universities offer just one per cent of their undergraduate load at the medium HECS rate as a fee, they will gain some additional $17 million in income next year.

         <para first-indent="16">
          As a consequence of that, if they were to offer places next year at the rate being offered to overseas students at the average rate of about $11,000, Australian universities would gain an additional income of over $40 million next year with one per cent of fee paying students. They are allowed up to 25 per cent of fee&amp;hyphen;paying students once they have filled their Commonwealth funded quota.

        That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Tuesday, 23 July 1996, of the Honourable Frederick (Fred) Meares Osborne, CMG, DSC and Bar, VRD, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Evans, New South Wales, from 1949 to 1961; Minister for Customs and Excise in 1956; Minister for Air from 1956 to 1960; and Minister for Repatriation from 1960 to 1961; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

        Fred Osborne was elected to the federal parliament in 1949. He served as a minister for 12 years in the Menzies government and lost his seat in the very significant swing against the Menzies government in the election of 1961.

       <para first-indent="16">
        After leaving parliament, Fred Osborne resumed his career as a lawyer in Sydney. He became a partner in the firm, first of all, of Ebsworth and Ebsworth; in fact he had remained a dormant partner in that firm during the time he was in federal parliament. He subsequently joined the firm of Dudley, Westgarth and Co. He went on to build a very impressive commercial career. He became a director and/or chairman of a large number of
        <break page="3239" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         public companies and, in every way after his parliamentary career, became a very reputable and respected member of the business community in Sydney and, in a broader sense, throughout Australia.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He also continued his commitment to the Liberal Party of Australia after losing his seat. It was in the context of Fred Osborne's involvement in the Liberal Party organisation in New South Wales that I got to know him very well. Until the early 1960s Fred Osborne was just a name to me, but when I joined the New South Wales executive of the Liberal Party in 1963 he was the Treasurer of the New South Wales division. He went on in 1967 to succeed Jock Pagan as the President of the New South Wales Liberal Party, a position he held until 1970.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Fred Osborne's best known contribution to politics was the time that he served in the federal parliament and served as a minister between 1949 and 1961. However, a little known but nonetheless very significant contribution that Fred Osborne played in reshaping the non-Labor parties, and in particular the attitude of the Liberal Party, to an important social and political issue of the 1960s was the role he played in the internal debate within the Liberal Party on the very sensitive issue of state aid for independent schools.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As honourable members will know, in the early 1960s the Labor Party was almost overwhelmingly opposed to state aid for private schools, particularly the dominant forces in the Labor Party at that time, despite the attempts of Gough Whitlam on various occasions to do something about it. It really was not until the 1972 election that the Labor Party finally embraced aid to independent schools. The Menzies government, as you will recall, in 1963 offered direct government assistance to the construction of science blocks in schools irrespective of whether they were government or independent schools. In the 1965 state election, the pro state aid policy of Robert Askin played a significant part in the defeat of the Labor government that had been in charge of affairs in New South Wales from 1941 when Sir William McKell was elected Premier under the defeat of the Renshaw government in 1965.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fred Osborne, from my own personal knowledge, played a decisive role in bringing about a change of attitude within the Liberal Party towards that aid and, in the process, brought about over time a very significant change in the composition of the Liberal Party. It was in those days an overwhelmingly protestant party, and because of the way in which the debate changed in the 1960s the character and composition and the breadth and the diversity of the Liberal Party changed very significantly.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Fred Osborne played an enduring role in that internal debate. He made a very courageous contribution at a time when something we now take for granted and regard almost as a relic of our immediate postwar history sparked a very significant difference of view. It did in the Labor Party and it certainly did in the Liberal Party. It is to the credit of people like Fred Osborne and John Carrick from New South Wales in particular that the Liberal Party managed to embrace the change and to solve the problem a little earlier than our political opponents. I have no doubt that, if you review the politics of the 1960s, the earlier and astute embrace of those changes by Menzies and others in the early 1960s was a very important political event which played a very important role in shaping what happened.

         Fred Osborne was a courteous man. He served the Crown, his country and the cause of liberty with great courage and distinction in World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1940 for `bravery and devotion to duty' while assisting the evacuation of British and French forces from the coast of Norway. In 1945, while in command of the destroyer HMS

         He was respected and liked by all in the business community who knew him. He contributed much to charitable causes in the Sydney area. The political tradition of his family has been carried on. His son Michael is a very active member of the executive of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He chaired a committee that led to a major
         <break page="3240" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          change in the preselection system in New South Wales. I look around me and I see a number of my colleagues from New South Wales who remember those changes with enormous gratitude. I am sure they played no mean part in the election to parliament of Joseph Benedict Hockey, John Joseph Fahey, Anthony Abbott, Joanna Gash, Gary Nairn, and so the list goes on. His daughter Imogen has been a president and very active member of a branch at Longueville, which has been part of my electorate for most of the time that I have been in this place. So the family tradition is carried on.

         â€”Mr Speaker, I would like to join in this condolence motion and express my deep regret at the death of Fred Osborne. Fred Osborne was a very distinguished Australian. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have pointed out, he served with great valour during the Second World War with the British navy, the Royal Navy. On returning from the war, he became a member of the House of Representatives and served as a minister in the Menzies government from 1949 until 1961. After he left politics, he made a new career for himself both as a lawyer and, in particular, in the business communityâ€”a career of very great success.

He was a man of great courtesy, a man of great personal charm and a man with what I think could be described as very steady and sound judgment.

        Phil Lucock, a former member for Lyne, was born in Eltham, Kent, in England on 16 January 1916. He studied theology but interrupted his studies to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1941. After his discharge from the RAAF he resumed  his studies and became a minister of the Presbyterian Church. He entered federal politics in 1952 when he won the New South Wales seat of Lyne. In his maiden speech to parliament Phil spoke of the economic difficulties facing Australia at that timeâ€”in particular, the need to contain inflation. It is funny how some things do not change a lot. He also reflected on the pressures borne by the government of the day.

        Phil's long parliamentary career saw him embrace many issues of public concern. In the days before his retirement in 1980, he commented on a wide range of issues, including the Western economic system, the level of state borrowings, the role of the backbencher and the role of the media.

        I certainly got to know Phil well when I entered parliament in 1974. He was welcoming and friendly to new members. He was instructive to them about the practices of the House. He was one of those people from whom you could always get advice. He would give you a nice, long, interesting story as he gave you the advice, but it was nonetheless very enjoyable. He had a very resonant voice and he sometimes gave long rulings from the chair, but they were always inordinately courteous and they were usually impeccable so far as their technical accuracy was concerned. He was a very active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He was regarded with affection and respect by so many people.

        He represented the electorate of Lyne for the National Party from 1952 to 1980, a period of some 28 years.

It says:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        When the parliament meets tomorrow you may be expected to pay a tribute to Phil Lucock, who retired from the House before the elections at which you were elected to it. Remembering the difficulty of saying something fresh on such occasions, I thought you might find it interesting that he was the first person to be elected to the House after the death of George VI and therefore  the first MHR to swear allegiance to our present (but last?) monarch. The Queen ascended the throne on 6 February 1952 and Lucock was elected at a by-election on 22 March 1952. Joe Cook, WA, had already been appointed to the Senate on 7 February and sworn in on 26 February.

        In a subsequent conversation with Goughâ€”I thought that having sent me that missive I ought to pry furtherâ€”he pointed out that Phil Lucock was the first member of parliament to swear allegiance to a Queen since the initial members of parliament. There were then subsequently two Georges and two Edwards. It is something of note, anyway, in the course of these remarks.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Gough also had another thing to say about Phil which was very interesting too. He said that his view of him when he was in the chair was that he was by far and a long way the most effective chairman in the processes, and the opposition tended to take his rulings on matters as rulings which had some authority. They were not infrequently at variance with the Speakers of the day. This is not a situation that applies now or that we anticipate applying now. But that was, as far as the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was concerned, the situation that applied when he was in opposition for a substantial period of time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that Phil Lucock said that he had no regrets about being in parliament. In fact, he said that the parliament gave him an opportunity to serve many more people than he ever could have served in a parish. Along with my father, Mr Lucock had an abiding concern for the unemployed and believed that workers and management should seek to resolve their problems responsibly through cooperation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note, too, that Mr Lucock was involved in an interesting ballot for the deputy speakership in 1978. Seventeen government members voted for the then opposition in support of his candidacy. Unfortunately for him, he was unsuccessful. In fact another former distinguished member Clarrie Millar won the ballot by 62 votes to 52.

        He crossed the floor to vote with the opposition on one occasion, during the vote on the Primary Industry Bank Amendment Bill. That is something no members do very lightly.

         â€”I wish to add a few remarks to this condolence motion. In so doing, I want also to pay my respects and condolences to the family of the late Fred Osborne. Both Fred and Phil Lucock represented a generation who post World War II developed this country in a way that is too often forgotten. Fred served with very considerable distinction in the Royal Australian Navy and Phil, as the

        Phil was a very significant parliamentarian. He saw the problem in the development of our society in trying to maintain a balance between the executive and the legislature. On quite a number of occasions he raised concerns about what he saw as the problems as the nature of government expanded and the responsibilities of those who are ministers gradually meant their divorce from the day-to-day concerns that affect the average member of the legislature. I think he waged a very effective campaign to ensure the recognition by those who are ministers of their membership continually of the House and their responsibilities to this place as well as to the government.

        Phil Lucock was a very good Deputy Speaker for the duration of his service and there has already been sufficient said about the way in which he performed. In relation to his role as Deputy Speaker there is only one thing I would add to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he referred to the fact that so often it was his rulings that were preferred to those of the Speaker. There was one particular occasion, I recall, when he was apparently finally pestered to the point of feeling that the then honourable member for Bass, Gil Duthie, should be expelled from the services of the House, he named him. On that occasion Arthur Calwell, who was then Leader of the Opposition and, of course, a papal knight, rose to defend Gil Duthie. It seemed rather paradoxical that there should be a papal knightâ€”a distinguished member of the Catholic churchâ€”rising to support a Methodist against a Presbyterian. I might add that, in those circumstances, his advocacy actually prevailed. It shows you that there can be unanimity in the ecumenical way in this placeâ€”even dispensed from the chair.

        Phil Lucock was a notable contributor to the parliament and he was a very good member for Lyne. I have a very fond regard for his memory, in part because when I first stood as a candidate I really knew no other

         members in this place other than casually. I had certainly not met the then leader of my party, Mr John McEwen, nor of course had I met Mr Robert Menzies. Phil, as the only person I really knew in the area, came to support me when I stood. I remember that we addressed a meeting in the streets of Walcha, which is a small country town in my area. Phil and I stood on the street corner trying hard to win support for my cause and the local bikies had been primed by my opposition to ride up and down just where we were standing. Phil, Presbyterian minister though he was, suggested we adjourn to the local hotel. As soon as we did so and had bought a drink for the bikies we were able to conduct our meeting in peace.

         â€”I do not know that the drink with the bikies necessarily wasâ€”this was in the days of yesteryear. Having said that, I would also say that he, like many others of those who served in World War II, came to this place with a different background from today's generation. I think we do well to remember the contribution that men like the late Fred Osborne made to the formation and structure of the Liberal Party, as did Phil Lucock to the nature and structure of the Country Partyâ€”today, of course, in latter&amp;hyphen;day terminology the National Party.

         â€”As the current member for  Lyne I feel a duty to participate in this condolence motion and I certainly express my condolences and those of my family to the family of the late Phil Lucock. Phil and I both came from the same small country town of Wingham. As I grew up and conducted a business there Phil Lucock had a profound impact on the way I conducted that business, the way I entered

        Phil used to thoroughly enjoy political discussion at a very local level. Whether or not it was in a business or on the street, you could hear Phil discussing the politics of the day from one end of the main street of Wingham to the other. It was interesting to note the analogy that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had passed on to him by former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam about Phil Lucock being sworn in: the first member of this place to have sworn allegiance to the Queen. Phil is well remembered around the township of Wingham for the fact that, when he was in the electorate and driving around the town or other towns, he would wave to everybody. He would not miss a soul. It would not matter who it wasâ€”as he drove past he always had this royal wave. Phil Lucock was well known for that.

        He used to conduct a radio program on Sunday nights on 2RE: not just talking about religious matters, but talking about matters that were of great importance in the federal parliament of the day. This was back in the days when television was not quite as prevalent and when people listened to the radio a lot on Sunday nights.

        Phil Lucock was a civic father in the Manning region. For one who was born in England, educated in New Zealand and a representative of the Australian parliament, I think he carried that off extremely well. I certainly am honoured to follow in his footsteps as the representative for the seat of Lyne, although when he was first elected in 1952 the seat of Lyne I think went almost from the Hunter River up to the Hastings River. I only have an electorate about a third of the size of that. The member for Paterson probably has the other two&amp;hyphen;thirds in his electorate.

        Phil Lucock used to travel far and wide throughout that electorate. He used to thoroughly enjoy those old&amp;hyphen;fashioned street meetings and it would not matter if there was nobody there. In my early days in this party, as a party organisational person, at election time I would be called upon to introduce the
        <break page="3246" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        As I say, Phil is well remembered in our area. His funeral was held in Brisbane but there was a large and well attended memorial service last Friday in his home town of Wingham. I delivered the eulogy in the Presbyterian church where Phil used to minister. My opening comment was that Phil's 28 years of service to the people of Australia in the House of Representatives were but a small part of the broader service that he gave to Australia in the Air Force, as a Presbyterian minister and as a very dedicated member of Rotary. Right up until his last days he was a dedicated member of Rotary, serving his community and serving his country.

        I think that it is very important that we do honour all that Phil Lucock achieved. He always used to highlight his background. He loved to tell people, `I was born in England, educated in New Zealand and you have got me representing you in the federal parliament of Australia.' I, along with previous speakers, pass on my family's condolences to Robert, Ian, Patricia and Alison.

        I well remember one occasion after he had retired from the parliament and he went back into the church.

I can recall one instance in Bowraville, which is a verandah&amp;hyphen;post town in the Nambucca Valley in my electorate. We had a special day for the historical museum, and they had moved a small church from somewhere out in the valley. Phil was conducting the service.

I certainly do aspire to emulate his skill and the way he conducted himself in the Speaker's chair.

        I would like to conclude, though, by saying that my friend and colleague the present member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) alluded to Phil's capacity for waving to everybody as he went around the electorate. As you all know and have probably all practised, as you are driving around you have your hands on the steering wheel and you raise a little finger here and a little finger there to greet people. Phil had the reputation of having waved to every cow and every tree in the electorate. That was merely a description of how well he served that electorate of Lyne. He was assiduous in doing that. He is a loss to Australia. He was a great Australian.

         He came from the school of the old Country Party. When I think of himâ€”and I listened to some of the earlier commentsâ€”I think also of his successor, Bruce Cowan. They represented the Country Party. They were really the role models of the Country Party in that they had a very close relationship with people in country Australia. They were the characters who preceded the arrival of the economic rationalists in the Country Party, which was to become the National Party.

         â€”On budget day 1996 Australia is a long way indeed from being relaxed and comfortable. Australia feels distinctly uncomfortable and distinctly insecure. Australians feel misled and betrayed by this Howard-Fischer government. One thing stands alone as to why they have that particular feelingâ€”that is, Australia has a Prime Minister who could not lie straight in bed. Australia has a Prime Minister who

          conned his way into power. He conned the Australian people into believing that the most conservative politician in Australia's historyâ€”his own wordsâ€”had become a born&amp;hyphen;again sensitive new age guy. He had become the sort of political leader where butter would not melt in his mouth. He had become the sort of political leader who helped little old ladies across the road.

Among all the people who are feeling betrayed on this budget day 1996, one group stands out. I am talking about higher education in Australia and the students, the parents and the citizens who have as their great Australian dream fair and equal access to a university education.

        There is one thing that hurts above all thatâ€”one broken promise that cuts to the heart of working families in Australia. That is the promise that the Prime Minister made before the election that he would not touch higher education. This is the same John Howard who will talk day and night about families. The truth is that he really does not understand working families and their aspirations. There is one thing that matters to them above all else. That is the idea that their kids can have fair and equal access to a university education.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The truth is that, when the Prime Minister talks about families and one Australia, he is really talking about one Wollstonecraft or one Kirribilli and the traditional white picket fence family which has the money in their household income to access higher education. That is his vision of families in Australiaâ€”one Wollstonecraft; one Kirribilli. The reality across Australia is very, very different indeed, because above all else those Australian families believe in fair and equal access for their children to a university education. It is interesting that all this rhetoric about families all comes down to the fact that the Liberal Party only believes in two types of familiesâ€”the traditional family and the royal family. Even these days among the royals if you are a divorcee, you are apparently off the Prime Minister's dance card.

        These family values are becoming narrower and narrower all the time and for working families in Australiaâ€”that is, the lower to middle income familiesâ€”this higher education budget is an atrocity. It is a betrayal of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         trust and a betrayal of the confidence that they gave this government on 2 March. It is an absolute disgrace which deserves the condemnation of this House as it has been condemned across the university sector in Australia and throughout the Australian community. Those people in the community had the great Australian dream of fair and equal access to university education for their children. It is the great equaliser in our society, that people from a working&amp;hyphen;class background can get a university education. Those dreams and beliefs have been dashed on budget dayâ€”the budget of betrayal in 1996.

        We on the Labor side of the House know these things because we have been to graduation ceremonies in working&amp;hyphen;class electorates. We have seen the tears in the eyes of the parents who watch their childrenâ€”the first in their family; the first generationâ€”take out a university degree. They did not have to buy it because they were rich; they did not have to purchase that degree because they were wealthy. That degreeâ€”the first in their familyâ€”was delivered by the policies of Labor governments. I know these things because I am one of the beneficiaries. If Gough Whitlam had not abolished tertiary fees in 1973 I would not have gone to university at the end of 1978. I see it again in my electorate. In the 1970s in western Sydney you had to travel to Sydney university because the Fraser government would not build a university in our working class region. Now, as a product of the reforms and higher education policy of Labor governments from 1983 to 1996, most of the students participating in tertiary education in my electorate go to the University of Western Sydney.

        The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) might respond in debate by saying, `Wasn't it the Labor party that introduced the HECS?' That is true, but we did it for a very sound reason, and that was that every single cent raised out of the HECS would go back into the university sector. They were the dollars that built the University of Western Sydney and gave working&amp;hyphen;class kids their chance to get a university education. That was the funding mechanism that almost doubled the number of university places in Australia, from

         350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 in 1996. This is the government and the minister that will take out a large slab of that funding expansion. Earlier today he was here in question time saying, `These universities should be quite thankful that they will have a dollar term increase in their budget. All we have done is take away their growth funding.' Of course, on the forward estimates every single cent that was going to universities in Queensland, Western Australia and western Sydney was growth funding to keep up with the population growth and the per capita arrangements that the Labor Party set in place.

        The member for Goldstein is saying, `You can have a small dollar increase in your university funding, but we will slash away the growth funding and the per capita funding.' It is like saying to those universities and working&amp;hyphen;class kids and families, `You should be thankful that I stole your car but I did not steal your TV.' It is like the member for Goldstein saying, `You should be thankful we are sucking the blood dry out of the university sector, but we are not driving a stake through your heart.' The truth is that the government cannot have it both ways. It must understand that it is damaging the growth and expansion of the university sector in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a government that is raising extra revenue out of fees and a separate system of university funding based not on merit but on wealth. If you have the wealth and the disposable family income to buy a university place, you can have it based on wealth alone. In all those contests for university spots below the HSC cut&amp;hyphen;off point, if you have the money in your pocket, if you are from Kirribilli or Wollstonecraft or if you have a wealthy family background, you can buy a university place. They are also placing an active disincentive on working&amp;hyphen;class kids to make the choice for their university future by lowering the HECS threshold from $28,000 to $20,000. That is a difficult choice for those students because they have the problem of forgoing income by undertaking a university education. When you tip the balance, you tip the balance against their active decision and opportunity to undertake a university education.

         Of course, the irony of this is that every single cent that this government is raising on the revenue side in higher education is being taken away from the universities. The government is taking the money out of the higher education sector to put it into its flawed budget strategy. It has both hands around the throats of Australian universities and working class students. It has one hand collecting more HECS and collecting it earlier and another hand taking away the grants from those universities. It is very interesting indeed to note the response of the minister, Senator Vanstone. She described these particular cuts, the $623 million over four years, as `just a nick'.

          â€”Yes, `just a nick'. The truth is that what she was effectively saying to working class families was `nick off'. That is what she was really saying to working class families, because this government is in the business of establishing a higher education sector not on the basis of merit, need, regional location or equity, but on the basis of wealth and privilege. She is saying `nick' all right; `nick off' to working class kids and their families. She is placing an active disincentive in the way of those students who are worried about the possibility of paying HECS back on a threshold of $20,000 per annum.

         She is also in the business of demanding higher repayments to be a professionalâ€”that is, the best jobs in society go to those who can afford in advance that particular HECS payment. As many academics and university administrators have acknowledged, that is creating a two&amp;hyphen;tier education system in Australia; one for the rich and one for the poor. Not only that, but in the budget tonight we will see it in health; one health system for the rich and one for the poor. These are the standards of this government with its budget of betrayal. Overall, the greatest betrayal is in higher education. There are many families in the suburbs and regional towns of Australia who are feeling worried about this budget. They are feeling worried about the cutbacks and the loss of the active role of government.

        I am very happy to detail to this House the nature of the inequities that existed in the previous policy, which this government has now redressed. The concept of equity is one which was highly ideological. It did not reflect the views of mainstream Australia. It disadvantaged young working&amp;hyphen;class people who could not get into the Commonwealth funded places under the previous government. The sort of people the member for Werriwa is referring to generally came from schools in disadvantaged areas. They were the ones who tended to have the lowest entry scores and were disproportionately represented amongst the tens of thousands who made up that statistic of unmet demand, against whom the doors of the universities were locked by the ideology of the previous government.

        The hypocrisy involved in the remarks of the member for Werriwa almost beggars belief. His party, after all, introduced the HECS scheme on existing students and went to election after election promising not to increase HECS and increased it relentlessly year after year. In 1989, the thresholds were one, two and three per cent. In 1990, the Labor Party government increased the thresholds for repayment to two, three and four per cent. In 1993, they increased the thresholds to three, four and five per cent. In 1995, they added four new levels of repayment on top of the existing onesâ€”3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and six per centâ€”with the support of their colleagues in the National Union of Students.

You'll be penalised if you offer additional places.' What was the unmet demand? How many students were shut out? Last year, the Australian Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellors Committee estimates that between 16,000 and 24,000 qualified students were locked out.

        One of the things we must recognise is that the previous government, in introducing HECS, did introduce a mechanism which enables everyone who wants to access universities the chance to do so in a way which ought not to deter them, regardless of their present income and present financial situation, because they pay back nothing until they are in a financial position to make that repayment. We maintain that system. We supported it at the time, it had bipartisan support, and we continue to support it.

        In addition, we are going a very important step beyond what the previous government was prepared to do. We are getting rid of the ideological restriction imposed on the right of universities to create additional places. Under the policies we have announced, a university which has met its full Commonwealth funded quota of HECS supported places can create additional HECS supported places. We will pay the universities the HECS attributable to those places. That means universities which have unused resources, which have staff available to teach courses, can expand the number of places available and funded through the HECS scheme. The government has fully factored in the cost of that in its calculations for the funding of the system.

This gives the lie to the claims made by the opposition that the government is going around slashing funding to universities. The government's efficiency savings are being imposed across the public sector. The opposition, when in government, put in place the Hoare management review of universities, indicating that it had concerns over the efficiency of university management, and now it complains when the government imposes an efficiency dividend on universitiesâ€”an efficiency dividend which will not prevent the resourcing of universities improving. In addition to the operational funding that the Commonwealth will provideâ€”when you take research funding into account, the total Commonwealth contribution to universities will fall in the following year, in 1998, by about $8 millionâ€”they will have access to these additional HECS funded places and the fee paying places that they will be able to create.

The benefit of that change will flow to Australian families and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, that will be very evident in the budget tonight. Not only will the universities have for the first time the strategic flexibility that the former government was never prepared to give them; they will also be able to provide additional places over and above those which are currently in the system, and they will have more resources with which to do so.

        This government's package for higher education, as this matter of public importance points out, is a crass betrayal of young Australians' aspirations for fair access and participation in higher education. It is a package that involves not only betrayal but deception as well. It is a massive breach of promise to the Australian electorate. It is a package that forgoes equity and access. It rejects inclusiveness and promotes exclusivity. And it is a package that is funded on hypocritical principles. Without doubt, the proposals will do significant harm to Australia's system of higher education.

        Under Labor, Australia's higher education system was internationally regarded as `one of the most accessible systems in the world'. The shadow minister has pointed out the growth in enrolments from around 350,000 in 1983 to 630,000 this year. That is some achievement. Over the four forward estimates years for the current budget to the year 2000, this government intends to achieve net savings of $1.8 billion through a combination of funding cuts and dramatically increased HECS charges.

        However, even that $1.8 billion understates the real position as universities will have to absorb the cost of salary increases to the tune of $200 million to $300 millionâ€”we are over $2 billion. The government's higher education package, as I said, is a massive breach of promise on the part of the coalition to the Australian electorate. This is the very same coalition which undertook before the election to `at least maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities both in terms of operating grants and research grants'. This is when the vice-chancellors said, `This is a fair thing.' Even many of the students said, `This is a fair thing.'

        Increased HECS charges will mean that those from low income backgrounds will need to contemplate a greatly increased level of financial risk before they consider embarking on a university course.

For example, the government fails to take into account the decision to abolish funding for a range of important programs grouped together as discretionary funds. This amounts to $214 million over the forward estimates years. To be fair, the government actually announced that before the election. But the government also fails to take into account that over 90 per cent of Commonwealth funding for universities is provided in the form of operating grants. These will be cut by $623.6 million compared with the levels of the former Labor government.

In doing so, they clearly buried the notion that tertiary education is more a right than a privilege. Higher education is, in the main, financed by the taxpayers of this country. There is little complaint even from those who derive no direct benefit from the system because their investment produces qualified people who benefit Australia during their working years. That benefit is dependent on graduates being able to find a job. For every graduate to become productive, they must be qualified and the work force must be capable of absorbing them. On both counts, the Labor Party stand condemned.

I am amazed, given those statistics, that it would oppose changes to this system. If the Labor Party members were supposed to have learnt the lessons from their crushing defeat on 2 March, they very clearly have not.

         Around this time of the year, passions are aroused by the widespread rumours of cuts. The university vice&amp;hyphen;chancellors hit the trail months ago to sell the line that this government would savage the budget for higher education. In fact, Commonwealth funding for higher education operating grants and research will increase by $50 million next year. If that is `savage', I would like to know what `catastrophic' is for universities.

         Universities are being asked to find savings of 1c in every dollar this year. They will have the time to plan and budget so that they can find another 4c in the dollar by 1999. These are hardly draconian measures, especially at a time when many Australians are being asked to make sacrifices for the greater national good.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If those whipping up the hysteria in the community about our higher education policy would study the facts, they would find some interesting initiatives. One such plan is the introduction of 4,000 HECS&amp;hyphen;free scholarships that will aid people from rural and remote areas, indigenous students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

        As all here in this House are aware, the tragedy in Port Arthur in April prompted historic decisions in relation to firearms in this country. On l0 May and 17 July the Australasian Police Ministers Council agreed on nationwide gun control measures. I have already set out the details of these measures for the House during debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996 and Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All governments in this country are agreed that possession of firearms is not a right but a conditional privilege. The new measures
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         will include effective nationwide registration of all firearms, the need for applicants for firearms licences to establish a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm and uniform basic licence requirements. Personal protection will not be regarded as a genuine reason for owning, possessing or using a firearm.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A significant element of the measures is the amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of self-loading rifles, self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. Such guns are to be the subject of nationwide restrictions. There will be limited access to certain categories of self-loading rifles and shotguns and pump-action shotguns for primary producers and exemptions for military, police and occupational shooters licensed for a specific purpose such as extermination of feral animals. The scheme will require gun owners to hand in firearms falling within the restricted categories during the nationwide amnesty period in return for fair and proper compensation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Commonwealth agreed to meet fully the direct cost of the compensation-for-surrender scheme, funds for which have been raised by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97. This increase is already in effect and it remains only to permit the moneys raised to be paid to the states and territories to assist them in achieving the full implementation of the new nationwide gun control measures overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A very large total cost is involved. It is estimated that the increase in the Medicare levy will raise around $500 million. This government has agreed to provide assistance to the states on such a scale to demonstrate national leadership in dealing with the problem of gun control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill allows me to authorise payments by way of financial assistance to the states and territories for the purpose of providing compensation to firearms owners and dealers. It also allows me to authorise payments to the states and territories and by the Commonwealth for purposes directly connected to the compensation scheme and for implementation
        <break page="3260" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of the new nationwide licensing and registration schemes. The bill appropriates moneys from the consolidated revenue fund for these purposes.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Payments for reimbursement of compensation paid for surrendered firearms are limited to those surrendered during the national amnesty period of 10 May this year to 30 September next year, or such shorter period as I determine if any jurisdiction decides on a shorter amnesty. Gun dealers will also be able to claim for loss of business associated with surrender of stock and the Commonwealth will reimburse the states and territories for compensation paid in relation to such claims if the claim is lodged during the national amnesty period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Swift action is essential if we are to have really effective nationwide firearms laws. The Commonwealth has already demonstrated its commitment by acting quickly to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to complement the resolutions of the Australasian Police Ministers Council and by increasing the Medicare levy. Now it is time to take the next step to support the states and territories in their endeavours to achieve effective controls.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Simple and short though it is, this bill is of major importance in the implementation of the national firearms program. It provides support to the states and territories, will enable the compensation-for-surrender scheme to go ahead and, I hope, encourage owners of banned firearms to come forward and surrender them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is, therefore, extremely important that the bill be passed through the parliament as quickly as possible. The government has acknowledged this by introducing it on the first day of sittings. We have had the support of the opposition right from the beginning for the new nationwide firearms laws and it has been invaluable in achieving community consensus. I ask the opposition to continue that support and pass this bill quickly. In this way we will help to encourage the speedy surrender of these firearms and ensure greater protection from violence for the whole Australian community. Let us all act together to make this country a safer place. I commend

         â€”The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) before the parliament has two primary purposes. One of those could fairly be described as quite routine in that it closes a loophole in the Defence Force Discipline Bill, which is consequent upon some changes in legislation in the ACT. The purpose of that bill has been set out in the explanatory memorandum and in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). Of course, the opposition is happy to support that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal purpose of the bill before the parliament, though, goes to improvements in the subsidised loans available to Defence Force personnel through amending the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act. The improvements involve an increase in the maximum loans available from $40,000 to $80,000 in the case of personnel where there is only one serving member in the family. Where there are two serving members in the family and a joint entitlement, the maximum level is increased from $80,000 to $160,000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition supports the bill and particularly welcomes those initiatives to assist Defence Force personnel. Importantly, the bill also provides for a reduction in eligibility for loans from six years to five years and extends the eligibility to include reserves and emergency forces. These measures are welcomed by the opposition. Indeed, those measures were committed to by Labor prior to the last election. I am delighted that the Liberal Party, in the lead-up to the election, endorsed those commitments and extended on them. That is a matter that I will be pursuing when we get to discussion of the bill in detail because I will be giving the government the opportunity
        <break page="3261" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to actually implement the full intent of their election promises through the amendment I will be moving at that stage.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn my attention to the positive aspects of the bill. It is appropriate that people in the defence forces have their conditions of service checked on a regular basis to ensure that they meet the needs of the service and the changing demands the service places upon them and that they also keep pace with wider community variations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Defence personnel are our greatest defence asset. We place a lot of attention and media focus on the various pieces of hardware that go to make up the equipment Defence Force personnel use, but there can be no doubt that the great advantage Australia has in its defence is the dedication, the training, the commitment and the sheer quality of those people who wear the uniforms. That is an assessment which I am sure all members of the House who have had the pleasure of any experience of defence personnel would gladly endorse.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is appropriate that we do acknowledge that defence personnel are placed under conditions that are not normally to be accepted or confronted by others in the work force. One of those is a very regular requirement to transfer location. Posting rotations of two or three years are not uncommon and requirements to shift not from one town to another but from one corner of the country to another are not uncommon. I am aware that the government is looking at the opportunity to extend the length of postings, as did the previous government. Indeed, a number of comments were made in the Glenn report about the importance of providing some stability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact that people have to endure very significant transfers on a regular basis, from one corner of the nation to another, dislocates a whole range of things. It makes life difficult for those who have a spouse and for those who have children. It makes it difficult for them in relation to their children's education as they move from one system to another. It makes it difficult for their spouse to engage in paid employment. The opportunity for a spouse of a Defence Force person to maintain
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a career structure is invariably cut short every three years or so as they are moved from one part of the country to another.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It also makes life difficult in some of those things that many in what I might describe as normal employment would take for granted: the opportunity to acquire a house, to make it your home, to invest some of your life savings into it and to call one place your family's home. It is partly in recognition of those things that the government has, over time, provided a subsidy to assist defence personnel to acquire accommodation and to purchase their homes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is fair to say that, over time, the level of home loan assistance has not kept pace with the rising cost of real estate. It was for that reason that the Labor Party in government committed to an increase identical to the increase that the new Liberal government has now legislated for. We are therefore very happy to support it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am also very pleased to note that the bill picks up on an extension of eligibility to reserves. Increasingly, the part-time defence forces of Australia are going to play an important role in the defence of our nation. If Army 21 ever does get to see the light of dayâ€”as each month goes past there are more and more questions asked about thatâ€”and assuming the minister does finally get around to making a decision about Army 21 and it gets endorsed in anything like the form it was submitted in, then we will see a much greater role for reserves and a recognition that Australia's defence relies upon a total force made up not just of the dedicated full-time personnel but also of those dedicated part-time people. Typically, they add to a private job, family responsibilities and normal community activities the burden of very significant Defence Force service contributions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is appropriate that reserves are able to access defence home loan assistance. I applaud the initiative that allows a full-time equivalent of service for reserves to be counted as eligibility for access to the home loans assistance scheme. The requirement for reserves over time is going to increase, and I would urge the minister and the government to look more broadly at other conditions of
        <break page="3262" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         service that are currently applied to full-time personnel and to look at their application to part-time reserves.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we are going to have a total force in which reserves play an integral partâ€”and that is certainly the way in which the forces are now structured and I believe the way in which they will be into the 21st centuryâ€”then we do need to look at a continuum of not just service but of benefit to those who serve. That means addressing not just questions such as home loans but rates of pay, access to medical benefits, dental benefits, long-service leave, superannuation and a raft of other benefits that accrue to those in full-time employment in the services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is a significant step, though, in recognition of the contribution that reserves make. It was a commitment of the Labor government before the election that we would legislate to do these things and we support the initiative now taken by the Liberal government to do that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a concern to me that in practical terms some of these measures are not in accord with other activities of the government. Much of Australia's defence forces are distributed in regional Australia. Those difficulties that I mentioned people encounter when they transfer are exacerbated when regional Australia is feeling some economic pain. The fact of life is that this government in its short time has already determined to reduce support for regional development programs.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has made a series of reductions in government services in a number of areas. I could go through the debates about the cuts in the department for regional planning, the cuts in job creation programs and the cuts in the forward estimates for tertiary places in regional Australia. All of those things impact very much upon defence personnel who are increasingly being placed in regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, when we talk about the difficulty that defence spouses are placed in when they move to new locations and have difficulty in getting jobs, those cuts which the government is making now that affect regional Australia impact doubly upon those spouses. They are doubly disadvantaged. They confront the same
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         economic difficulties as everybody else in that community but as new people into the location suffer an additional burden that places them behind the eight ball.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When their children move to a school whose funding has been restricted or seek to go to a tertiary institution in regional Australia only to find that there are fewer places next year than were provided for in the forward estimates of the last budget, they suffer along with everybody else. It is passing strange that these initiatives, which I endorse in this bill, unfortunately and regrettably are not supported by other initiatives that the government has taken.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to turn to the matter of the government's pledge before the last election. During the election campaign, the Liberal Party's policy statement was committed to those things that are contained in this bill, but of course the Liberal Party is committed to other things as well. I will quote the relevant section from the Liberal Party's own document, which states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The coalition will increase the maximum loan value under the ADF home loan assistance scheme from $40,000 to $80,000 and the eligibility period will be reduced to five years. This will come into effect by 1 July 1996, not 1 January 1997 as proposed by Labor.

        After the second reading debate, I will move an amendment to give effect to that part of the promise which has either been omitted because people overlooked it or omitted because they no longer have the heart to implement the undertaking. The amendment that I will move will ensure access to these new home loan limits from 1 July, and will afford government members the opportunity to vote for their own policy.

         â€”It can be done. In fact, my understanding from the briefings that were given to my staff on this matter is that there would be few people affected if it were to be changed to 1 July. Assuming few people would be affected, there would not be much money involved, although I do find it somewhat interesting, in looking at the explanatory memorandum for the bill, that the financial impact of the bill in the current financial year is $5.9 million. It is estimated it will rise to $12 million in the next financial year, 1997&amp;hyphen;98, and the year after that it will rise to $16 million. I can only assume by that that the difference of about $6 million between what you anticipate paying out in this financial year and what you anticipate you will pay in the subsequent financial year is the $6 million you promised before the election you would give service personnel and are seeking to deny them now. My amendment will enable you to provide that $6 million to them.

        This one provision for a home loans subsidy for defence personnel was actually part of a bundle of initiatives that the Labor government was addressing before the last election. They arose from the Glenn review, established by former Minister Punch. During the Glenn review he identified a range of issues that required improvement ifâ€”as I said at the outset of my speechâ€”we were to ensure that defence personnel conditions kept pace with their needs and with contemporary employment practices. One of the things that was mentioned then was, in fact, an increase in the maximum amount available under the defence home owner scheme.

       <para first-indent="16">
        On 10 December last year the then minister, Minister Punch, issued a statement on behalf of the Labor government undertaking to implement that commitment. But it was not just that one commitment, and it was not in isolation. This is not a bandaid approach that we should be looking at to address the needs of defence personnel issues. This was part of a coordinated approach to ensure that the net of services and benefits and remuneration available to people in defence was the best to attract high quality people and to retain them.

        So we also gave commitments to child care, to occasional care, to family day care and to an ADF spouse employment program.

        In fact, I understand that people in defence these days are not allowed to call it the Glenn review any more. Someone in the ministerial wing feels somewhat offended by that reference. I am not sure whether that is because they do not like the government that it was previously produced for, they do not like its recommendations or they feel uncomfortable with Mr Glenn. They did not feel uncomfortable with the name `Glenn report' before the election, though. Again, in their election manifesto, in their `Defence Personnel' section at paragraph 6.4, they said:

         <break page="3266" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          does provide, in the second major component, an opportunity for those who are disadvantaged by the frequent moves, which seem to be part of a service career, to acquire their own home and to maintain it and to act far more in pari passu with those who are in the community than would otherwise be the caseâ€”that is, in civil employment.

        There are two components to the bill, and I want to address each of them briefly. The first, of course, relates to the Defence Force disciplinary legislation and the Defence Force Discipline Act, which is a very important part of trying to ensure that the criminal law provisions that pertain to all members of the community pertain equally to those who are members of the Australian Defence Force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the change reflects is, in fact, the paradox of our not having federal criminal law. It has always seemed to me to be rather strange that we are in the position where there are differences, be they minor, between the different states. Of course, this legislation began by the application of so much of the New South Wales criminal law as is applicable to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not aware, and I have not gone into the particular detail, but I had always thought the criminal law for Jervis Bay and Canberra was the same. I presumed that, because they chose Jervis Bayâ€”and there is, of course, a very significant naval presence within the Jervis Bay territoryâ€”there must be some reason for it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the time the legislation was last before this House I cannot recall why we decided that it should be the Crimes Act 1900 that applied to the Australian Capital Territory's application to the Jervis Bay territory rather than looking at the Crimes Act 1900 as it applied to the Australian Capital Territory. I do not know what the nuance of that is.

        The significance of this amendment is to ensure that there are no shortfalls in legislative competence as far as any existing prosecutions are concerned. While it has only briefly been referred to by both the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in her introduction and by the spokesperson for the opposition, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), I think
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         it is important that we try to ensure that there is an understanding across Australia of what criminal law provisions affect those who are in the Defence Force, as much as an understanding by those in the community at large.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the life of me, from reading it I have been a little bemused to know what the significance of this change is, other than picking up those for whom there may be some ongoing prosecution. The nature of the change is obviously one on which there can be little debate. I think it is important that there be a maximum understanding of what criminal law applies to what person and where. I question the extent to which there is some particular difference, other than the fact that the Jervis Bay territory is now part of the ACT and the ACT is now an independent territory and whether that has given it some peculiar significance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The nature of this change in the face of the legislation that is before us is a little hard to comprehend. I think it is probably more hard to comprehend because the ACT is a separate territory. It does seem a little odd that we are now deciding that it will be the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory rather than New South Wales and its application to the Jervis Bay territory. I am not too sure what the practical outcome of that is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I support the change, but I am interested to know what is excluded were the legislation to be just the law of the ACT rather than just the law of the ACT as it is in force in the Jervis Bay territory. Any legislation should be comprehensible and understandable. In this sense we are moving from the application of a state law, although it was particularly applicable to the ACT, to one that brings affairs more up to date. It therefore is one which no doubt is more related to prosecutions under way and, apparently, some shortfall. There is nothing in the explanatory memorandum, the minister's speech or otherwise to explain why we are doing it this way, other than, I presume, that because the ACT is a separate territory it is necessary to pick up the fact that Jervis Bay has changed its territorial status as a result. Why we need to keep the specific reference to Jervis Bay, I am not sure.

         The second part of the bill is the substance of the legislation, and it is on that that I wanted to make a few remarks. I really have not been able to follow the amendment that was foreshadowed by the honourable member for Brisbane. As I understand the effect of the passage of the legislation, the legislation will apply to any individual applicant from the date of the approval of the loan. The terms are being changed so that the eligibility is reduced in the period of years of service, there is a new category for reservists and the amount which an applicant is entitled to receive is also being increased. There will also be a spouse's joint entitlement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I understand the effect of the legislation, until it is passed by this place there is no capacity to make an application. If there is no capacity to make an application, it means that until we have passed this legislation both here and in the Senate no application will be made. If you date it back to 1 July, you cannot make an application between 1 July and 20 August because the legislation has not gone through. If the legislation has not gone through, the effect of your amendment is not to enhance the eligibility of an individual in any way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On the form of words that you have used, I do not frankly follow the purport of the change. While I understand that it might be a political point and relate to an election undertaking, it would only have been applicable had the legislation been passed during the last sittings and the date of assent to the bill had in some way been postponed to after 1 July. Once it has been passed by this place, subject to passage through the Senate and the process of approval by the Governor-General, you then need to apply and any application will be dealt with according to the terms of eligibility that are now prescribed within the legislation. Those terms will ensure that the individual, subject to meeting the criteria which are set down and which are now changed and are made more generousâ€”justifiablyâ€”will have exactly the same entitlement as if you dated it back to 1 July because they cannot apply until after 20 August.

          As to the amount, I suspect that that is because in the nature of things, it being 20 August, there will be some delay between now and the time the legislation is put into practice by the Department of Defence. Any applications made will necessarily begin from the time of their approval. Presumably, that will mean that the first application may not be until some time in September. There are inevitable battles of scrutiny, so you have at least missed one-third of the year. Whether that is the reason for the particular sums being given and the cost, I am not sure.

          I suspect, knowing most of these schemes, that people who might well wish to apply are not all going to be processed immediately. I suspect that next year there will be an ongoing processing, which will commence from 1 July. In the present financial period it is unlikely that all those who may be eligible will have their applications in and will be processed in the normal course once the legislation is enacted.

          The significant part of the legislation is designed to ensure that there is an additional entitlement for service people to overcome that inevitable move that takes place in their careers every two years. I must say that when the Defence Housing Authority legislation came before this House I was very apprehensive as to whether or not it would provide a change in the quality of residential accommodation available to those who rent. As I understand it, the quality of defence homes today is much better than it wasâ€”it needs to beâ€”and so we can say that the Defence Housing Authority has done a remarkable job.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Much of the housing was antiquated. Much of it dated from World War II. In particular, single and married quarters on defence facilities were inadequate to meet the parallel standards that one expects in the services, especially with the additional hazards and obligations that service people have compared with their civilian counterparts. It was essential that a great deal of additional funding be provided. It was also necessary to dispose of a lot of those antiquated houses. It is always difficult to measure the effectiveness of defence housing. However, from wandering around the defence basesâ€”as I do from time

          One aspect that I would like to comment on is the difficulties with the education of children. Also of concern is the degree to which it is easier for a partner to get a job on some bases than it is on others. While there has been a significant improvement in the quality of housing, there are still difficulties in trying to ensure continuity in education and employment for the families of defence personnel.

          That really takes me back to my first observation about the degree to which criminal law varies from state to state, even if it is to a minor degree. Basic costs for defence personnel being transferred still need to be addressed. It has always seemed to me, for example, that the qualifications of some professions are too state oriented. It is quite ridiculous that people who are qualified nursing sisters in Victoria have to be readmitted if they are transferred from a naval base in Victoria to one in Cairns.

         <para first-indent="16">
          If people take their motor vehicle, it has to be reregistered in the state to which they are posted. If people go from a school in one state to a school in another state, because of the relativity in the level of education, someone in fifth class in a school in New South Wales who transfers from a naval base there to one in Western Australia will find that the courses available and the level of education will not be quite the same. There is inevitable disruption.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I have long felt that we need to find a way to accommodate those who are transferred from state to stateâ€”and not just those in the defence forces, although it certainly applies to them. Those who are at a state level of administration need to register that while there are differences around Australia they are imposing undue and often harsh penalties on those who, for one reason or another, are transferred interstate. Often people find that their families, because of the circumstances of their employment or the opportunity for their family members' education, are pressured into deciding to linger somewhere else. In many instances that means that there are defence personnel whose families live a long way from them.

          <para first-indent="16">
           They do that because they want to try to achieve a normal life. It means that they want to provide continuity of education for their children. A child in Year 11 in New South Wales, whose parents are in the services and who are transferred interstate, will find it difficult to complete the HSC in the time it would normally take. The pressure to complete your education to a certain standard means that there are times when families suffer. Certainly the service person who is moved finds it a wrench to decide whether to accommodate the desires of the family or to meet the obligations of the service.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           There is another way in which this could be overcome. Where transfers are to be made, the position of families should be taken into account by those who are posting them. So the posting should be made at a time of the year when the education of children would not be prejudiced. That still does not overcome the difficulty of motor vehicle registration, professional qualifications and necessary state registration obligations, nor some of the other facets related to the differences that exist state by state around Australia.

           Having said that, there is little doubt that the provisions in this legislation, which expand the opportunity for individuals within the services to have a greater opportunity to fund their own homes, reflect a step in the right direction. It is one to which the coalition is committed and one which I welcome, both in the additional funds made available and also to the extent to which it means that there is a more equal chance for defence people to acquire and own their home and to follow their careers without being as disadvantaged as they are at the moment.

           Many have been able to use their superannuation to buy a house after they leave the Defence Force. Today, the degree to which you can commute your pension and acquire adequate funds to do so are more limited than they once were, and there is a greater tax obligation. For that reason, I think the opportunity of giving them this subsidised loan during a stage of their career when they have a chance to get a title to a home while they are still in productive employment in the services is desirable in a social as well as an

      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) The Australian Government believes that there is an urgent need for a peaceful resolution of this tragic conflict so as to protect civilians throughout Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnic identity. The conflict is primarily one for the players in Sri Lanka to resolve but we are taking every opportunity in our ongoing contacts with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage progress towards a negotiated resolution.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) Australia is already providing substantial emergency humanitarian assistance to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict in northern Sri Lanka. This assistance is delivered through the ICRC and other non&amp;hyphen;governmental organisations. In April 1996, Australia shipped 2 000 tonnes of wheat to Sri Lanka to assist with food shortages caused by conflict and drought and in May, Australia provided A$1 million to UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres to assist victims of the conflict. Given ongoing hostilities and the unpredictable nature of the conflict the Government does not consider it would be desirable for a delegation to visit the North or East of the country at this time. A parliamentary delegation visited Sri Lanka in October 1995 and held discussions on a range of issues including the ethnic conflict and Australian development assistance.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) The fact that this issue was not addressed at the most recent CHOGM, in Auckland last year, was criticised by me at that time. Australia will look closely at the possibility of a role that an impartial body such as the Commonwealth might play in assisting a peace process in Sri Lanka. The Australian Government would see value in third party mediation in the conflict particularly through the Commonwealth, provided that international mediation was acceptable to both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE, and that both sides were willing to engage in genuine negotiations on substantive issues.

       Discussions with the RTA have established that the existing 4&amp;hyphen;lane capacity of the F5 between Brooks Road and Camden Valley Way is adequate for traffic movements at present but its widening to 6 lanes needs to be kept under review. Delays during peak periods can be experienced northbound due to a combination of high traffic volumes on the Highway and the weaving movement caused by the large number of trucks entering at Brooks Road which has then to cross the traffic exiting at the Camden Valley Way interchange. Some improvement in these conditions is anticipated in 1996/97 when the State Government funds construction of an eastbound off load ramp from the M5 to the Hume Highway at Casula as an alternative to the exit at Camden Valley Way. The weaving movement will be reduced by northbound traffic continuing on to the proposed new ramp in lieu of exiting at the Camden Valley Way.

       (1) In the event of a major emergency at or in the vicinity of Sydney Airport, the NSW Medical Emergency Plan will be activated: this is a subplan of the NSW Disaster Plan (DISPLAN). Under the plan, the NSW Department of Health will arrange for casualties to be sent to hospitals around Sydney, including the St George Hospital. The decision on which hospital is chosen for individual casualties will be based on bed availability, the nature of the injury and the urgency of treatment. This decision will be made by medical personnel at the emergency site.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       St George Hospital and other nearby hospitals will also each provide an emergency medical team to attend the airport to triage and treat the injured prior to transportation to hospital. Each hospital only provides a single team so as not to strip the hospital of emergency staff and the number of teams will depend on the number of casualties involved in the emergency. A rough rule of thumb is one team per 40 casualties.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) There were 22 signatories to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement as at February 1996. These were: Canada, the United States, Japan, the 15 member states of the European Union, the Republic of Korea, Israel, Switzerland and Norway. Singapore, Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of the Netherlands with respect to Aruba have applied for membership.  Chinese Taipei has applied to accede in the context of its WTO accession negotiations.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) The agreement covers thirty&amp;hyphen;seven (37) states of the United States as well as the Federal government.  A list of entities in the states which procure in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  appears in WTO document, WT/Let/57 of 19 January 1996.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) Yes. No signatory has offered 100 per cent of its government procurement for coverage under the agreement. In most cases, signatories have adopted a positive list approach in nominating the entities and sectors covered. The Annexes to the agreement provide details of the coverage agreed for each signatory in terms of purchasing entities, goods and services. Annex 1 lists central government entities and sets out any qualifications that have been placed on coverage of goods procurement by those entities. Annex 2 deals with sub&amp;hyphen;central entities, Annex 3 with government enterprises, Annex 4 lists services covered and Annex 5 lists construction services covered. The General Notes attached to each signatories' offer lists specific derogations and exceptions as well as reciprocity conditions negotiated. The annexes for each signatory and the General Notes are included in and form part of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. Amended Annexes 2 and 3 for the US and Annex 1 for the European Communities are provided in WTO document WT/Let/57.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (4) No. The operation of the agreement does not affect Australian industry development programs as Australia is not a signatory to the agreement and is not required to join it. Should the Government decide to seek accession to the agreement, industry development programs which involve offsets as
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        described in Article XVI and footnote 7 of the agreement could be affected. However, the Article would not have any effect outside the coverage of the agreement, for example in relation to exceptions to the agreement and exclusions or derogations negotiated by the parties. In order for a program to be affected it would need to be applied by entities nominated by Australia, involve sectors nominated for coverage and involve procurement above the stipulated threshold value applicable to the entity. No decision has been made by the Government on membership or non&amp;hyphen;membership of the agreement and no consideration has been given to the details of potential coverage at this stage. The Commonwealth's discussion paper, Australia and the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (DFAT/DAS, May 1995) provides a discussion of the issue in the context of potential implications of membership of the agreement.

        (1) The majority of departments do not have this information readily available, with the exception of the Department of Defence which produces such information on a monthly basis. The Department of Finance, however, produces a quarterly report listing permanent staff, by agency by location. The most recently produced report details staff numbers as at December 1995. As it is unlikely that the figures provided would vary by more than 1.5 per cent between December 1995 and 1 March 1996 (given that the entire change across the APS for the 1995 calendar year was 1.4 per cent) the answer to the honourable member's question is based on the data sourced from the Department of Finance report, with the exception of the Department of Defence. I have also included the total number of temporary staff employed by each agency as at December 1995 although the data for temporary staff is not readily available in a disaggregated form by State/Territory.

        (2)&amp;hyphen;(4) Progress on the announcement of proposed staff reductions is necessarily varied across departments and the situation is a developing one. An attempt to provide an overview ahead of the delivery of the Budget would not give a useful representation of reductions. The government's objective is to reduce the cost of government as part of a thorough and necessary overhaul of expenditure. The level of expenditure will be considered as part of our deliberations on the Budget, and there will be some reduction in staffing levels across the public service. The extent to which compulsory retirement, as opposed to voluntary retrenchment, may be necessary is impossible to estimate at this time.

In relation to this issue, a study of aircraft noise around Jandakot Airport is presently being undertaken for the Federal Airports Corporation by a qualified, experienced consulting firm.

       The Western Australian Department of Transport had proposed Nowergup as a possible site for a general aviation airport in a draft report prepared in 1993. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) expressed concern to the Western Australian Department of Transport at the time concerning several airspace related issues, including potential flight safety implications. The Western Australian Director General of Transport wrote to the RAAF on 4 June 1996 advising that the Western Australian Minister for Transport had accepted his recommendation that the Nowergup site be formally withdrawn from the list of site options.

       (10) Under the National Integrated Settlement Strategy, the three tiers of government are engaged in a process to plan the integrated and equitable provision of services at Commonwealth, State and local levels. All State and Territories have settlement plans which take account of the needs for settlement to be addressed in regional and remote areas. In some States and Territories, this has extended to the development of specific regional plans.

       SBS advises that there has never been a high level of production of suitable program material in Croatia, or in any other region of the world which has a sizeable Croatian population. SBS has investigatedâ€”and in most cases viewedâ€”every program identified as Croatian, and made every effort to acquire any program considered suitable for transmission. The lack of programs is due primarily to the recent war and the resultant lack of funding for film making. SBS has recently made an offer to buy a Croatian television drama called The Great God.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (1) Tourism has become the main commercial use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park over the past decade in terms of the number of vessels, people and structures it employs. Use of the Marine Park by tourists has grown from about 150,000 visitors in the early 1980's to about 1.5 million in 1995/96.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       This growth in use of the Marine Park has resulted in the management agency, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, implementing a number of strategies in order to keep pace with the predicted 10 pc per annum growth in tourismâ€”whilst balancing the need for protection of the unique environment of the Great Barrier Reef.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       The Authority has responded to this increased use in a number of ways. In 1993/94 a visionary 25 Year Strategic Plan for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area was developed and is now being implemented by stakeholder groups. The Strategic Plan set 25 year and 5 year objectives for the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the World Heritage area. The Plan is supported by more than 70 government and non-government agencies, interest and user groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Strategic Plan is acknowledged as a world first in participative regional planning.

       The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is divided into four sections each of which is subject to a
       <break page="3326" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        detailed zoning plan. Zoning plans are one of the Authority's prime tools for managing multiple use of the Marine Park. A major review of the Zoning Plan for the Far Northern Section of the Marine Park is currently being undertaken and a number of minor reviews of the other sections of the Marine Park are also underway. In addition the Authority has also developed management plans for high use areas such as offshore Cairns and the Whitsundays. Other measures such as delineating `no anchoring' zones, designating `no structures' subzones and declaring moratoriums on the issue of new tourism permits in the high use areas, are providing the Authority with a broader range of planning and management instruments and with breathing space to properly consider longer term management strategies with which to control the effects of increasing use of the Marine Park.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Another of the strengths of the Authority's management of the Great Barrier Reef is the close working relationship it has with the Queensland Government and Queensland management agencies that extends to the adoption of complimentary management plans for areas under the jurisdiction of each government and a jointly funded arrangement for the day to day management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park that enables Queensland officials (generally Department of Environment officers who are Marine Parks rangers) to act on behalf of the Authority within the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

       A review of tourism use of the Marine Park is also about to commence. This review will be conducted in partnership with the tourism industry and will, among other things, aim to develop a strategic tourism use policy and management mechanisms.
