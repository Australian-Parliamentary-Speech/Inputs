              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I seek your indulgence to make an explanation. Mr Speaker, I want to address the issues that have been raised publicly last week. Senator Thorpe has advised me that she remains friends with a Mr Martin and that her connection with him began in 2021. This means that she was the Greens' justice spokesperson and also a member of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement at the time. Senator Thorpe has acknowledged that this should have been disclosed. Following my request, Senator Thorpe has resigned from the position of deputy leader in the senate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said last week, I first became aware of these matters when recently contacted by the media. After I made inquiries and as has been reported, it became clear that Senator Thorpe's then chief of staff raised the connection with Mr Martin with my chief of staff in 2021. My chief of staff tells me that he advised Senator Thorpe's chief of staff that the issue should be raised with Senator Thorpe. He has also told me that after a subsequent conversation between the two chiefs of staff my chief of staff understood that the issue had been addressed. He did not inform me of these matters at the time and I wasn't aware of these matters until the media raised them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very good and competent chief of staff who makes many good decisions. The failure to inform me of this matter was not one of them. I should have been told, but I wasn't. In failing to inform me my chief of staff did not meet the expectations of staff in my office on such matters. I have counselled my chief of staff. I have also since reinforced with my senior staff the importance of raising any such matters with me directly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also consider the principal responsibility for disclosing these issues to me sat with Senator Thorpe, and she has agreed that she should have disclosed this to me. Senator Thorpe has assured me that committee information was treated in confidence. She completely rejects any suggestion she would do anything other than treat all such information confidentially. I also note that no-one has suggested otherwise. I note also that Senator Thorpe has not held the justice portfolio since the election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Thorpe is an incredible fighter for her people. Senator Thorpe has important work to do on First Nations justice, including on progressing truth, treaty and voice. I want her to be able to do that work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In making inquiries about this matter I have also caused a search of the emails sent to my private and public parliamentary email accounts to be made. It appears that in 2016, prior to me becoming Greens leader and prior to the matters the subject of media reporting, a Mr Dean Martin sent an email to our public inbox about the deportation of Mr Shane Martin as part of an email chain that referenced both the former minister for home affairs and other members of parliament. As Mr Dean Martin was not a constituent of mine at this time, it does not appear that my office took any further steps on his behalf, but I am making further inquiries on this front. It appears that a number of people were advocating for Mr Shane Martin at the time and that the emails were sent to a number of politicians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matters have also been raised publicly about the handling of a complaint made to my office by a former staff member and about the Greens parliamentary complaint process. In the initial ABC report last week there was a suggestion that we had not followed our own rules in dealing with a complaint made by staff to our office about Senator Thorpe. In respect of that complaint, I am advised that an independent review of Senator Thorpe's office, auspiced by the Department of Finance, was commenced as requested by the complainant. We are awaiting the outcomes of that review, which will then be dealt with in accordance with our processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also asked the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service to independently review the Greens' internal complaints processes and recommend any changes. It's absolutely vital that current and former staff feel supported in coming forward and raising any issues they wish. We are currently reviewing our processes, including in light of recent events, to ensure that this is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to assure anyone who wants to raise any issue with us and wants it to be dealt with either by us or by an independent body: we will support you. The actions I have taken, including this statement, are based on inquiries I've made, searches of my private and public emails I've caused to be made, advice I have received and the facts as I understand them to date. However, as I have made clear publicly, if any further information is provided to me or becomes apparent, I will of course consider it and act on it, including updating the House if necessary.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  The coalition believes in and has always been a strong supporter of choice. We want Australians to have a choice on where they live, where they work and how they raise their kids. We believe that all parents who work or study should have access to care for their children if they want it or if they need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has always been passionate about getting Australians into the workforce. Whether it's their first job, a new job or supporting families back into the workforce after having their children, we have a strong record when it comes to this. Under the coalition women's workforce participation rates were at an all-time high at 62.3 per cent in May 2022. It was 58.7 per cent in September 2013 when Labor last left office. We want to see more women in work. We want to see more children and families access early childhood education, which is why the coalition will not oppose this bill. However, we have several concerns with the government's legislation, and we call on the government to address these concerns to ensure the sector is not placed under further pressure come July 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are disappointed with the government's lack of detail in the early childhood education policy, given they had nine years in opposition to perfect it. It's clear the government has no effective plan to address the current workforce shortages or the pressures faced by our early childhood educators. Over the last four months I've held roundtables with educators around the country to discuss issues within the sector, and every single one I've spoken with has expressed the concern that this legislation will create more demand and so put more pressure on them—a workforce already under great pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 7,000 vacancies currently across the sector. Almost every centre I've spoken to is desperate for more staff right now. They know that by July next year without additional staff there's no way they can take on more children. According to Goodstart, the biggest not-for-profit early childhood provider in the country, an additional 9,000 educators will be needed in the sector under these changes. Goodstart, like many other providers around the country, is concerned about the additional pressure 1 July will bring. As John Cherry outlined at the Senate inquiry just last week, 'The ability of the sector to accommodate extra demand for places next July given current staffing challenges should be of concern.' And it should be of concern. So I asked the government, 'What are you doing to address shortages in the workforce right now? What are you doing to address the concerns of educators so we can't only retain good educators in the sector but continue to provide the best start in life for our youngest Australians?' The Treasurer said there will be an additional 37,000 full-time employees created from this bill, but 15,000 ECEs and ECTs will be needed to support these measures. So I asked the Treasurer, 'Will almost half of those new entrants be qualified as early childhood educators and early childhood teachers?' The answer is a resounding no. The numbers just don't stack up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has talked about new TAFE places for early childhood educators. The coalition has always been and will continue to be a friend to TAFE. We want to see more Australians in vocational education, but these extra places won't do anything to address the current workforce shortages and they won't do anything to support the current educators. It takes time to qualify as an early childhood educator. In fact, when asked about it the government conceded itself that it will take time to get those educators trained and on the ground—time we simply don't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing we don't have from this government is a plan to improve access. With $4.5 billion of spend not one single new early childhood education place will be created under this policy. It is a shame for Australian families who currently don't have access. They won't get access under this bill. There won't be new access. The government needs to be upfront with families and explain how they plan to increase access to services when their policy will put higher demand on a system already under great pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centres are capping enrolments. They're closing rooms and they're already considering additional pricing increases as we speak, and it's across the board. It's possible, and likely, that some of the increased childcare subsidy could be lost to price rises between now and July next year—lost to inflationary pressures on fees. Be they large for-profit providers operating centres across the country or locally run community centres, the same issues are being faced by all providers. How will families send their children to the local early childhood education centre if there are no new places or services in their area? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the government promise that families in Port Augusta will have the same access to services as families in Mossman? And how will the families of the community in Kingston SE, for example, utilise the additional subsidies when they're still waiting to hear from the government on whether they'll deliver on the $1.8 million early learning funding Minister Rishworth promised them? There's no point in having $4.5 billion in subsidies if families who need it most can't access it for their children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the devil is in the detail, of which we're yet to see. According to the Mitchell Institute, a third of Australian families live in a childcare desert—that's nine million Australians. Fifty per cent of those deserts are in regional, rural and remote areas. Our side of the chamber understands how important it is for families to access services, no matter if they live in our big cities or in the regions. And we know that Labor don't care about the regions. They don't care about building infrastructure. They don't care about new early learning centres in the regions. Not one extra centre will be built due to this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy of the government is literally jaw dropping. On one side of their mouth they say they want to improve women's workforce participation and childcare access, and on the other side of their mouth they say they've axed funding from the Building Better Regions Fund for a new childcare centre hub and early intervention service in Bourke. They have a waiting list there of between 26 and 29 children, who are at risk of significant harm, and the community in Bourke was only told yesterday that the deal is off. It's a shame. There'll be no new places to benefit communities in regional cities and women's workforce participation in rural and regional Australia—not under this Labor government anyway. We've seen it time and time again, and my Nationals colleagues are all too familiar with the lack of action for regional Australia from Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has no plan to increase access in areas that are crying out for services, areas where women and men want to return to work but can't because there are no services to accommodate their children. Labor haven't said whether they'll continue the coalition's Connected Beginnings program, which aims to deliver 50 sites by 2025, providing much-needed access for Indigenous Australians living in rural and remote Australia. They've also yet to commit to new rounds of the Community Child Care Fund, which provides grants to services and providers in regional areas. We've heard the government bang on about how every family will be better off under their 90 per cent subsidy scheme, but how can a family be better off if they can't access a service that's near them, or if they're stuck on a waiting list for months just to get into their nearest centre? They simply won't be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government really cared about improving access to care, they would address the areas struggling the most and build new centres. Four point five billion dollars and not one extra new place. Can we even trust that that figure is correct? The figure started at $5.4 billion, then it went to $5.1 billion, and now they're saying it's $4.5 billion. What is the figure? The government has changed it so many times it's hard to keep up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Labor's track record is bad when it comes to money. They can't manage it. The bill is a structural spend and the costs are not yet properly understood. The last time Labor was in government, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years! Let that sink in. Costs are going to skyrocket again under this policy. The last CPI data, from June 2022, showed that childcare costs came down 4.6 per cent in the year to June 2022. That's thanks to the work of the former coalition government and our childcare reforms—the biggest reforms in 40 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has no plans to address rising out-of-pocket costs or rising cost-of-living pressures in child care. The ACCC inquiry they announced last month will cost a whopping $10.8 million, and it won't report back to government until late 2023, after this policy is implemented. It simply won't help to alleviate current pressures in the sector, including workforce and access. Australian families cannot wait that long. They need cost-of-living relief now. In true Labor fashion, it appears they've undercooked their policy, and it will blow out to a much larger number. Let's see the structural consequences to the budget from these measures. The government have only costed this policy for three days a week, which is the average number of days a child attends early childhood education. If the outcome of this policy is to get more children into ECE more days a week, why wouldn't they cost it for, say, four days or maybe five days? It's clear the government haven't done their due diligence on this policy, and they have done next to no modelling to show what the outcomes of their policy will be. They have not done modelling on the impact on women's workforce participation. They simply haven't done it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we know that the department's evidence last Friday in the Senate inquiry was that this bill brings confusion to the definition of 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children'. The coalition would like to see this definition the same across all policies, and there's work ahead to clarify that meaning so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have the certainty they deserve. The coalition has always been committed to our Closing the Gap outcomes, and we want to see more First Nations children attending early childhood education. Under us, the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children attending the year before full-time schooling increased to 96.7 per cent, beating our target of 95 per cent by 2025. But there's still work to do. We want to see new early learning places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To summarise, the coalition calls on the government to do more to address concerns raised by educators, the sector and families. The government needs a plan to increase access. The government needs a plan to increase the pipeline of educators and retain them in the sector. Otherwise, this policy will not deliver on the promises they have sold to Australians, leaving many children and families and the sector much worse off.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  Two years ago this month, I stood across there at that dispatch box and announced Labor's plan for cheaper child care in my first budget reply. It was the centrepiece of the first budget reply and the first step which saw those now on this side of the House walk across the chamber and form government. It was a critical commitment that we made to the working people of Australia, and we did it with the support of the business community, with the support of our electorates and, importantly, with the support, particularly, of working families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here today we had an opportunity for the 'noalition', who sit over there for a reason, to prove that they were actually capable of listening to the very clear message that consigned them to opposition on 21 May, and yet what we just had from the shadow minister is, again, a statement of objection to expanding child care—objection to expanding the support for working women. I wait for the class war rhetoric to come from those opposite—that we're helping wealthier women in terms of families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that this is a policy that will boost productivity, boost workforce participation and boost population—the three Ps. If you're looking at economic growth and how you grow an economy, they are known by all economists as the three Ps—participation, productivity, population. This policy delivers on all three, and it is very clear that we have an absolute mandate for this policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was back in Eden-Monaro this morning with its member, again visiting an early learning centre, talking to the workers there—the fantastic workers who provide such support for our youngest Australians. That is one of many, many dozens of visits to early learning centres that I have made since we announced that policy in 2020. And yet those opposite still have not got the message. They're incapable of actually moving at all. They think that they will just oppose everything, including a policy that we have an absolutely clear mandate for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This not a welfare policy; this is about economic reform. The bill will boost productivity, lift participation and remove one of the biggest structural barriers to economic equality for working women. When we announced this policy, part of it was to lift the cap. Those opposite said that was economically irresponsible and that would be a disaster for the economy—before they then announced it themselves. It was a disaster, but then they adopted it! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What those opposite are incapable of doing, though, is precisely what is in the title of the bill, the cheaper childcare bill. They're incapable of providing support for the cheaper child care that we will deliver for 1.2 million Australian families, starting in July next year—not a single family worse off but 96 per cent of families better off. Ninety-six per cent of families will be better off, but those opposite are angry about that. They're angry about that. They carry on about the cost of living. Here we have a practical measure that will make 96 per cent of families better off, but they're going to vote against it. That's fine. They'll be held to account for it. The plan we are delivering means significant savings for household budgets around the country. A family on a combined income of $120,000 with one child in care will save $1,780 in the first year of this plan alone. That's $1,780 more in their pocket in the first year alone. This bill helps with the cost of living, it invests in early education and it delivers overdue economic reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest untapped resource in our economy is the full, equal and resourceful participation of women, and the childcare system should be all about facilitating that, empowering it, helping parents return to work when they want to and helping mums and dads balance their career and their caring responsibilities in a way that works best for them. Yet at the moment it does the exact opposite. For so many families there's a cut-off, a financial cliff, where one partner—and it usually is the mother—is effectively penalised if they want to work more than three days a week. How does it make any sense at all that, if you want to more fully participate in the workforce and you work a fourth or a fifth day, then you receive very little, minimal, economic benefit from that? Sometimes you can actually go backwards. It can actually cost you money in real terms for you to fully participate in work, and that flows through, because it penalises not just those families but the businesses who don't benefit from having full-time workers. Not only does that impact working families at the time; it flows all the way through the system to lower retirement incomes for working women. Women retire with much less in superannuation and retirement savings than men—much less. One of the things that we're seeing in this country is that the fastest-growing cohort of homeless people, of people really doing it incredibly tough, is older women. They might find themselves by themselves, not part of a family with a male breadwinner or an male ex-breadwinner who is on a higher income. They are left by themselves, and they struggle to get by because they don't have the same retirement income that others do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is much-needed reform. The productivity agenda: if you speak to anyone in the business community—those opposite used to say that they represented the business community, but on climate no, not so much; on productivity no, not so much; on this area, not so much either. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, ACCI, every local business chamber will tell those opposite that this is about productivity for their business. This is about boosting productivity as well. As the Minister for Education noted when he introduced this legislation, Treasury estimates that in the next financial year our plan for cheaper child care will mean up to an extra 1.4 million hours of paid work per week for women with young children—1.4 million hours of paid hours worked additional. Those opposite might not have got the memo, but there are skill shortages in this country. There are businesses crying out for workers. Here we have a measure that will produce up to an extra 1.4 million hours of paid work per week. But those opposite say, 'no, not good'. It's the equivalent of finding an extra 37,000 full-time workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's about assisting families; it's about productivity; it's about economic reform. In the course of campaigning over the last two years for this reform I have spoken with a lot of families about this issue. It's my experience that nearly every Australian parent with a child in child care tells you the same two things about the system. The first thing they say is that the people working in it are remarkable. I have met some more of them again today. The Minister for Education proved that he was much better at art than I was today—the teddy bear that he drew there at the early learning centre will hang with pride of place; my bunny rabbit not so much. Parents trust early childhood educators with the most precious thing in their world, and across Australia they perform the vital work with love and care and creativity and a seemingly endless supply of patients. I do want to give a shout out to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So if the first thing that any parent tells you about child care is how great the educators are, the second thing that every parent tells you about child care is that it keeps getting more expensive. The figures are there—it's not a feeling, it's not a vibe. Costs have gone up by 41 per cent in the past eight years; 41 per cent on the former government's work. Let's be very clear. Childcare bills are not going up because educators are suddenly being paid a lot more. The rising fees vastly outweigh any increase in wages. That's why we have put the ACCC on the case, to make sure our investment gets prices down and keeps them down. That's why a key part of this legislation is about increasing transparency, making sure that the big providers in particular are reporting their profits and revenues to the Department of Education and are being upfront with parents about where their fees go. We're making child care more affordable and accessible and providers more accountable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Labor government is helping families with the cost of child care because we know the value of early education. Education opens the doors of opportunity for individuals, and it makes us a smarter, more productive, more future-ready nation. That is the third element to this as well: it's not only good for families, it's good for the economy, but it's also good for the young children themselves. All the experts tell us that over 90 per cent of human brain development occurs in the first five years. That is why it's astonishing that we are so far behind most of the OECD when it comes to providing this support. Education is a lifelong journey, and early education gives you such a great start. That's why it's important to note as well that this bill gives more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children access to child care—to help close the gap in education at the very outset. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's plan for cheaper child care benefits two generations of Australians simultaneously. It gives access to early education for a great start in life, flexible support for families, and a multibillion dollar boost to productivity and participation without adding to inflation. That is why we see this bill as the foundation, a hugely important first step—because in this term of government we are tasking the Productivity Commission to chart a course for universal, affordable child care. Just as universal Medicare guarantees every Australian the right to quality and affordable healthcare, just as universal superannuation ensures every Australian can know dignity and security in their retirement, we want universal child care to guarantee every Australian family the support they need and every Australian child the opportunity that they deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud we're delivering for families who voted for cheaper child care. You'll see it there in tonight's budget along with the other commitments that we have a mandate for—that Australians voted for in May. And there is nowhere a policy that we talked about more. This is the biggest single on-budget commitment that we made, and we made it in my first budget reply, so it isn't like they didn't see this coming. It isn't like Australians didn't have an opportunity to scrutinise this policy. We made it very, very clear from the outset, and Australians voted for it. That's because this is economic reform which particularly benefits working women. It was one of the themes, of course, of the Jobs and Skills Summit, held just a short time ago in this parliament, that those opposite couldn't be bothered to attend, with the exception—the honourable exception—of the leader of the National Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm determined for this to be the beginning, not the end, of making early education affordable for every Australian family that seeks out the opportunity. I encourage those opposite to wake up to themselves and go and talk to working parents and ask them if they support cheaper child care. Go and talk to businesses about whether they support the position. They're saying now, having moved an amendment condemning it, that they might vote for it! Now, that's the sort of consistency that I expect from those opposite! I commend the bill to the House and I encourage this parliament to vote for this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I support moves to make child care more accessible and more affordable for all Australian families. Not only is this sensible economic policy; it will also provide our children with the best possible start in life. It will increase female participation in the workforce. It will reduce the gender pay gap and make child care affordable for all families. Early education plays a crucial role in our society. However, right now, many families struggle to access child care places, and the cost of child care is a huge barrier for many women as they seek to return to the workforce. This bill is a step in the right direction towards universally accessible and affordable child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to female participation in our economy, Australia is behind our international peers. For although the World Economic Forum's global gender gap index ranks Australia No.1 for education of women and girls, we are ranked way down the line, 70th, for woman's workplace participation—a slide from 12th in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, the gender pay gap in Australia has also worsened this year and now stands at 14.1 per cent. This equates to the average Australian woman earning nearly $264 less every week than the average Australian man. In other words, a woman must work 60 extra days a year to earn the same amount. Women are also retiring with 42 per cent less super than men, and women aged over 55 are now the fastest rising segment of our population experiencing homelessness. Obviously, this is not fair and not right, nor is it economically viable for our nation to continue to disincentivise over 50 per cent of our population from working. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, women have been economically left behind in this country, and reform to make child care more affordable and accessible is long overdue. Research also illustrates the crucially important role early education plays in the development of our children. According to the organisation Thrive by Five, nearly a quarter of children are starting their primary school years in a vulnerable state due to a lack of quality early education, and evidence shows that most never catch up to their peers. If we do not make high-quality early education affordable and accessible to all Australians, we will simply fail our children. A child should never be denied critical early learning, nor should a women lose the opportunity to work because child care is too expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many mums in Mackellar and on the Northern Beaches have approached me on the street or emailed my office to tell me that something absolutely must be done about the rapidly rising cost of child care and that the cost of child care is the main reason they have not returned to work. The cost of child care has risen 14 per cent in just the last 12 months. Intelligent, hardworking, qualified and willing workers from all sectors of the economy are choosing not to work and not to re-enter the workplace, because it doesn't make economic sense to do so. As the Grattan Institute's Danielle Wood told the Jobs and Skills Summit earlier this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I can't help but reflect that if untapped women's workforce participation was a massive iron ore deposit, we would have governments falling over themselves to give subsidies to it and get it out of the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modelling shows that the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022 will create around an extra 37,000 full-time jobs, covering up to 220,000 additional days of work each year. This bill goes some way to mining that amazing talent pool that we are currently ignoring, and that is Australian women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we can't pretend that this policy will be a silver bullet. There are a number of issues that must be addressed for the cheaper child care bill to be successful. Currently, one-third of families live in what is called a 'childcare desert', where there is simply no child care available. So it doesn't matter how affordable child care becomes, these families still won't be able to access child care, as it doesn't exist in their area. These childcare deserts are predominantly in rural and regional areas, but they also exist in all capital cities. The Productivity Commission review of the childcare sector that was promised at the Jobs and Skills Summit must examine these supply constraints in the early childhood education sector. There must also be regulation to ensure that the increase in the childcare subsidy for families does not end up with childcare services simply increasing their fees and neutralising the benefit to families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the activity eligibility test, which looks at whether or not both parents are working, should allow for a base entitlement of 36 hours a fortnight for all children, regardless of whether their parents do or don't work. Often, it is the children of parents that do not work who are most vulnerable and are in most need of the intervention and support that early childhood education provides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one of the biggest challenges to the success of this bill is the fact that we are in the middle of a jobs and skills shortage, and the early education sector is one of the industries that is struggling to find enough workers. As we make child care more affordable and more accessible, so too will demand for early child educators rise. In August this year there were already 7,200 vacancies in early childhood education, and modelling shows that on top of this an extra 9,500 full-time educators will be needed to make this policy work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fiona Spencer is someone who lives in my electorate. She has operated childcare centres in Sydney and Canberra for over 11 years. Fiona told me that, despite welcoming this legislation, she has grave concerns for the future of the industry and worries about where the extra workers will come from. Fiona told me how COVID has made labour shortages even worse. In her words, she said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The system is failing children and failing staff to support the children. It needs a structural approach and a massive overhaul.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I commend the Australian government's commitment to the fee-free TAFE positions for early educators and to increasing the number of positions available to early educators in our skilled migration program, more can be done. From my discussions with the sector and other experts, it is clear that the No. 1 thing that we can do to halt the exodus of workers from early education and to attract more people to the sector is to increase their wages. In many places, you can earn more at Bunnings than you can working in child care and early education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis by the Australian Association for Research in Education and The Parenthood shows that the early education sector has an attrition rate of 35 per cent, up from 20 per cent. A survey of 4,000 workers during COVID showed that 73 per cent intended to leave the sector within the coming years. Data from the national early childhood education regulator reveals that in the first quarter of this year 8.1 per cent of childcare providers operated with a staffing waiver, which allows them to remain open despite having inadequate staff numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite having similar qualifications, early childhood educators are paid, on average, 30 per cent less than their counterparts working in the school system. We need to reverse this figure for this policy to be successful. To do so, The Parenthood has recommended that government fund a 10 per cent increase in wages for early educators. With cost-of-living pressures paramount in people's minds, this would help people to choose a career in early education and child care and it would send the message that their work is valued and vital. The Parenthood has calculated that a 10 per cent wage supplement for two years would cost $700 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this measure and call on the government to support this pay rise for our early educators, most of whom are women. Supporting a thriving and viable early education sector and making child care accessible and affordable for all Australian families is good economic policy. It's good for our children and it's a positive step in reducing the gender pay gap. I commend this bill to the House and congratulate the government for prioritising this legislation in order to get our country moving forward again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Chi</span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">ldhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  It is indeed a great privilege to rise here today to speak in support of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. I am proud to serve as the Minister for Early Childhood Education in an Albanese government—a government that delivers on its promises, a government that understands that Australian families are struggling with skyrocketing fees for early childhood education and a government that understands the importance of ensuring all families, no matter where they live, have access to quality early childhood education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's early childhood education and care reforms come after years of inaction from the previous government, with fees for centre based care rising by an incredible 41 per cent in the last eight years. I note that the shadow minister in her opening remarks said, if I may paraphrase, 'You've been in opposition for nine years; why didn't you do anything in opposition?' I turn that question around to the shadow minister and say, 'You have been in government for nine years; why didn't you do anything when you were in government?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's early childhood education and care reforms were an election promise. We went to the election promising to reduce out-of-pocket costs for Australian families, and this bill will do just that—cutting the cost of early childhood education and care for around 1.26 million families right across Australia. But this bill does more than that. It is about more than just increasing affordability. It's also about ensuring that we give families greater choice to participate in the workforce and give our children the best start in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The high costs of early childhood education and care, as those who have spoken before me have noted, can put early learning out of reach for many families and can act as a massive disincentive for people to get back into the workforce or to work more hours or more days, and that can impact on career progression for primary caregivers, who overwhelmingly tend to be women. Treasury estimates that these measures will increase the hours worked by women with young children by up to 1.4 million hours per week in 2023-24. That's the equivalent of 37,000 full-time workers. This makes a difference to the economy because this means families are generating extra income. It's building careers and the retirement savings of Australian women. The Prime Minister, in his contribution this morning, noted that Australian women are more likely to be in poverty and homelessness in their later years because of an interrupted career, because they're unable to save up that superannuation. A lot of that has to do with early childhood education being unaffordable for those women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early childhood education and care also play a vital role in supporting families and improving the education and health outcomes of our children. I really want to put an emphasis on that, because boosting access to early childhood education will ensure that more children experience the benefits of foundational learning, preparing them for a life of exploration and a life of learning. I emphasise this and say this very clearly: the main beneficiaries of the Labor government's reform are Australia's children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how powerful early childhood education can be for children. As a single mother, I had no choice but to go back to work. In raising my two children as a single mother, I experienced just how it important it was to have access to affordable early childhood education for them. Without it, I wouldn't have had the capacity to return to work, I wouldn't have had the capacity to return to study and I certainly wouldn't have had the ability to create a better life for myself and for my children. It's no overstatement to say that I wouldn't be here today without the quality early childhood educators who were so committed to giving my children a better-quality start in their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to parents across Australia who have shared similar stories with me about the part that early childhood education played in them being able to return to work and being able to build their families. They've told me how welcomed these reforms are, particularly by women who want that ability to choose to engage with the workforce if they so wish, to add to the family income if they so wish. But, importantly, I've also seen firsthand the power of early childhood education in children's lives, in the children that I've met across this journey. Last week, as part of Early Learning Matters Week, I visited Goodstart Nollamara, in my electorate. It's a fantastic centre. And this morning we were in Queanbeyan, with Minister Kristy McBain, Minister Jason Clare and our Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese. I've visited centres in electorates across the country and, in all of those visits, I've spoken to families and to educators alike about our changes, and they have all told me that they welcome the introduction of this bill and our broader plans to make early childhood education more affordable and more accessible. I know that's the message that members on this side of the House are getting from the families they represent in their electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech my colleague the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, outlined the key elements of this bill. I'm proud to be working closely with him to ensure that our reforms make early childhood education more affordable for around 96 per cent of Australians. One element of the bill that I want to take some time this morning to draw attention to is the changes to the activity test for First Nations families. That's an element that highlights our government's commitment to closing the gap for First Nations Australians. Access to high-quality early learning is a key measure, shown to reduce vulnerability and improve early childhood development. At the moment, only 4.3 per cent of children in early childhood education and care identify as Indigenous, despite being 6.1 per cent of the overall population of children aged zero to five.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides a base level, a minimum, of 36 subsidised hours of child care per fortnight for First Nations children, and this demonstrates our government's longstanding commitment to providing extra support for First Nations children and students, and our commitment to working with communities to improve outcomes for children. These simple changes will benefit around 6,600 First Nations families in care and encourage more families to access early education. Not only do these changes help ease the cost-of-living pressures, but also they provide even more opportunities for First Nations children to access the development, education and health benefits of early childhood education and care, helping to ensure that they are school-ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very proud to be working alongside the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, to develop the Early Childhood Care and Development Policy Partnership between Australian governments and First Nations representatives. That partnership is co-chaired by the national peak body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families, SNAICC, the National Voice for our Children. The partnership will work with governments to develop community-led policies and programs that First Nations families need for their children to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, in her contribution to this debate, the shadow minister raised several questions regarding several programs that we're doing specifically for First Nations children and, more broadly, around workforce issues and regional access. I will answer those questions in my contribution here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to those broader issues that are being experienced by the early childhood education sector, we know that, in order to be able to deliver our commitment to more affordable, quality and accessible early childhood education and care, we need to correct the years of neglect as to workforce issues, pay and conditions and staff shortages. That's why I've met with unions, providers, educators and peak bodies to discuss the issues that they're facing and committed to work with them. We know that ECEC workers make an important contribution in the lives of our children and families, and we recognise that they are educators, not childminders, and deserve greater recognition for the important work they do. This is something that I am deeply committed to and will continue to work on, with educators in the sector, unions and my state and territory counterparts. It's also why we're bringing forward fee-free TAFE places and funding an extra 1,469 university places for early education teachers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also committed to wage growth, which is why we successfully argued for a pay rise for the lowest-paid workers in Australia—something that those opposite opposed. It's why we're committed to addressing the gender pay gap and will strengthen the ability of the Fair Work Commission to order pay rises for underpaid women workers and allow multi-employer bargaining. It's why early childhood education was high on the agenda of the Jobs and Skills Summit and we're acting quickly to implement some of the commitments made at that summit. It's why my colleague the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Burke, will introduce reforms to deliver on our commitment to improve the industrial relations system. And I know these changes will be very significant for the early childhood education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National Cabinet has also tasked education and early years ministers with creating a vision for the future of early childhood education in Australia, with a particular focus on the workforce shortages. We're also delivering on the National Children's Education and Care Workforce Strategy implementation and evaluation plan, which outlines 21 practical actions to support the attraction, retention, quality and sustainability of the workforce in the long term. And that includes work on recognition of prior learning, microcredentialing, credentialing and the fantastic Big Roles in Little Lives campaign to promote carers in the sector. We're also committed to working with the sector and states and territories to find lasting solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community Child Care Fund supports early childhood education and care services to address barriers to participation in early childhood education and care in disadvantaged, regional and remote communities, something I know the shadow minister also asked about. We have committed to the CCCF, which funds around 900 services across Australia to ensure families have access to quality care where the market might not otherwise provide services. It's currently delivering approximately $533 million over four years, and over 60 per cent of grant funding supports services in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also developing a market strategy which will assist us to identify thin markets and areas of need and to consider solutions to address those needs. In terms of the Connected Beginnings program, which the shadow minister also referenced in her contribution, I can confirm that since we have come into government another eight Connected Beginnings sites have been opened, which now brings the number up to 32 Connected Beginnings sites, and we are well on our way to our aim of 51 Connected Beginnings sites by 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms build on a long-term legacy of Labor governments, who have for a long time focused on quality in early childhood education and supporting early educators. It was after all the Gillard government that introduced the National Quality Framework, a care reform to ensure all children across the country get quality education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In developing this bill, our government have engaged extensively with the sector, who we recognise have substantial knowledge and experience. That is critical to our government achieving their ambitious reform—people like my good friend Sam Page, the CEO of Early Childhood Australia, and people like Jay Weatherill, the director of Thrive by Five. So don't just take my word for it; take the word of those out there, people like Georgie Dent from The Parenthood, who know that these reforms are life changing for Australian families. We're going to continue to work in collaboration with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, I look forward to delivering a better future for all young Australians, no matter who you are or where you live—children like Zoe, who I met a few weeks ago in North Coburg, and Amara, who I met in Canberra. Zoe and Amara, you and children like you are this government's No. 1 stakeholder. The Albanese government wants the best for you and your future, and we will make sure that you have the absolute best start in life. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. Affordable, high-quality child care has many benefits to our society, to children, to their parents and to the economy. So what does this bill do? The government claims that around 96 per cent of families with children in early education and care will be better off and that none will be worse off, that families with a combined income of up to $80,000 will receive 90 per cent of childcare support for their first child in care, while families with a combined income of up to $530,000 will receive childcare support increase with the rate of subsidy tapering one per cent for every $5,000 earnt above $80,000. Currently, subsidy caps cap out, or stop, at $356,756, so it's a big increase to go up to that $530,000 cap. Second and subsequent children five and under will retain the higher childcare support, recognising the increased financial burden of multiple children attending child care. There are also targeted measures to improve access for First Nations families and staff of the childcare sector. Finally, there are amendments to increase the integrity, transparency and reporting requirements for childcare providers, including greater transparency of gap fees. This will assist parents enormously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is this bill so important? For children, we know high-quality early childhood education and care is robustly associated with positive outcomes at school entry and improvements in social development. This is an investment into our future as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Affordable child care is important for gender equity and the economy. As the minister has noted, families with two or more children in day care are finding substantial financial disincentives for one parent to work more than three days a week. Overwhelmingly, the mother is the one who works part time. This has a significant effect on career progression and women's superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like many in this place, can speak from experience of the juggle of child care. I used everything available, from my years studying to my years practising as a barrister, from public child care to family day care to long day care centres and, of course, to that group that we often don't acknowledge enough: the grandparents who are often filling the gaps in our society—unpaid and unrecognised, but doing so much to assist in actually keeping most families afloat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's something that we haven't talked about much in this discussion: how difficult it is sometimes, with the pressure and inflexibility within our childcare systems. Take the pick-up time: I don't think there is a parent out there in Australia that has not been stressed at the idea of the deadline for pick-ups. I just don't know who came up with the hours in the first place of what a traditional day of child care should be, because very few workplaces actually have similar work hours. So that gap between long day care centres and other childcare centres, and just being able to cover that full day, is so incredibly difficult. And what about weekends for people that are rostered on or working on weekends? There is very little that I'm aware of in the way of childcare availability when it comes to weekends. And that's where you fall back on grandparents. So I think that, in looking at how this area needs to be further developed and strengthened, there should be consideration of people who work hours other than the traditional nine to five—noting that child care often caps out at three, so I don't know what was intended about the nine to five!—and recognition of that assistance from our community, from grandparents, and of what they do, and of that carers' time that so many older Australians put in to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia recognises this aspect of child care when it comes to women's participation in the workforce. They noted in their submission to the Senate inquiry: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the workforce participation of women is one of our nation's biggest economic and social opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The provision of an affordable and accessible and quality child care system is fundamental to that goal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If parents are supported with access to quality child care in order to participate in work, education or training, the broader benefits to the economy are manifest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is so incredibly tough. I remember taking my son to university on the weekend because there was no child care available and I had to go to university lectures. I remember doing the juggle, which can be incredibly difficult when starting out in a profession. I think we really need to think about this system, this area of work, which absolutely underpins so many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I welcome the government's initiative and the budget commitment of $4.5 billion over the forward estimates, but I'd like to make some more observations. The maximum childcare subsidy of 90 per cent of the fee cap begins to taper after a combined family income of $80,000—just that. The latest earnings report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that average full-time workers make $92,029 per year. Even with two parents on an average wage, the childcare subsidy benefit begins to erode. With childcare costs rising 41 per cent over the past eight years, and Australia's inflation rate predicted to be more than seven per cent this year, any benefits of this legislation may quickly vanish. I note that, prior to COVID, childcare costs absorbed some 18 per cent of household income for an average-earning Australian couple with two children, compared to the OECD average of 10 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my constituents recently wrote to me about how she will be choosing to leave her job as a physiotherapist in an oncology ward simply due to the cost of child care. She's been working for $55 a day, pre tax. Her departure will not only remove her tax contributions from the government's revenue but also remove a valuable worker from an already strained health system. The government has indicated that it will commission the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to examine why childcare costs and out-of-pocket expenses are rising so much, together with a comprehensive review of the early education and care sector by the Productivity Commission. I welcome this review and I encourage it to also look at the flexibility and availability of hours and the issue of weekend care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome the transparency and reporting reforms contained in the bill. In terms of how information provided is reported, I would like to see a standard report, so that parents can make a direct comparison between providers and to make sure that the information is meaningful. I also encourage the government to ensure that exceptional circumstances exceptions for payments by electronic transfer or absences are not too onerous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know COVID had a huge impact on the sector. During COVID childcare centres struggled to survive. One issue was the number of absent days a parent was able to claim while keeping their child enrolled. Flexibility on absent days is so incredibly important. We are now living with the pandemic but still being encouraged to stay home if people are unwell. Similarly, a number of childcare advocates made the observation about the activity test linked to childcare benefits. Again, I would encourage flexibility on the activity test application, particularly in relation to First Nations and vulnerable families. Making workplace participation a prerequisite for childcare subsidy makes it harder for those already doing it tough to begin training or looking at work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour shortages: we know, in so many industries, that Australia is facing shortages in many areas. Child care is no different, but it is unique in that it is an enabler for many sectors, by enabling parents to work in a range of sectors. Availability as well as affordability is vital. While Warringah is not alone in facing issues with accessibility, I do know that in recent times the Mosman Council has closed its occasional care centre, and Brookvale out-of-hours care and long day care have advised that they are also closing. This creates a huge issue for parents who rely on such services to be able to work—in particular, as I've already mentioned, that discrepancy between the expectation of hours of work and the opening times of centres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week was Early Learning Matters Week. I visited the Manly Community Pre-school. They're struggling to attract sufficient certificate III qualified staff, as the low pay rate means that cert III staff are simply going into other sectors that are more attractive, like aged care. They told me there is a shortage of about 7,000 workers in this area. The Parenthood group estimates that to realise the full benefit of this bill an additional 9,650 full-time educators will be needed by next year to absorb the additional demand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents tell me that educators are leaving the sector in record numbers. They're burnt out. Their pay is so low. Family day care centres in New South Wales, for example, have continued to contract since 2016, and in the six-month reporting period to December 2021 they have reduced by some 7.6 per cent. Over the past four years there has been a 25.5 per cent decrease in the number of family day care approved services, and a 33 per cent decrease in the number of educators. This is incredibly concerning. As I've already said, the sector underpins and enables all other sectors, all parents, to go to work. So it is incredibly important that the sector be given the priority it needs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the decrease in the number of educators has a really negative impact on the diversity in childcare needs and the access to flexible and non-standard hours. Centres across the country are having to limit enrolments due to staffing issues. Northern Beaches Council staff have told me that, while the bill is a great step forward, staffing shortages are a significant barrier to enabling the bill to be sufficiently implemented. So I encourage the government to focus on the issue of attracting and keeping quality educators for all age groups. We need to be working with the education sector, with the TAFE sector, to ensure that those educators are coming down the line. It is no small task as it's a very large workforce, predominantly run and staffed by women. Family day care educators, for example, comprise one of Australia's largest network of women in small business. Electorates like Warringah are struggling to retain staff when the cost of living is so high and the pay for early childcare workers is so low. We need, as a society, to value the work these early educators are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to draw attention to the government in relation to the funding support for children with additional needs. I've been speaking with the Northern Beaches Council about the current inclusion development fund subsidy, which is currently $23 an hour, by the Department of Education. It has been this rate since 2017 with no CPI increase. The gap between funding and the amount paid to staff is simply growing. Currently, at the Northern Beaches Council the rate variation is $13 per hour for a casual staff member and $6 per hour for an entry-level cert. III. The annual funding gap this year is $202,000 for public centres in that council alone. The council is currently budgeting for 2023 and 2024. There is a significant increase with a growing number of children with learning support needs, likely increasing from 269 to 332 hours per week across northern beaches services. The annual funding gap will increase and this cost will be passed on, increasing our fees to all families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to recognise that there are more and more children with those additional needs. So programs like this need to be better adapted and the funding gap needs to be adjusted to CPI. Increased funding for supporting children with additional needs is important for avoiding seeing more children starting school developmentally vulnerable. It's well documented that early intervention and assistance is of huge benefit to children with additional needs and alleviates the costs incurred in the system later in the child's life. As we come to discussions around the costs—the blowing out costs—of the NDIS, the government needs to remember this. This early investment in the early stages makes a huge difference to costs incurred or needs later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government's investment in early childhood education and care and the improvement in the integrity measures, but we need to urgently work on staffing for the sector in order to meet this demand. We need to value early childhood educators and make sure we tell our young people, as they are looking at their careers of choice, that this is a career that will be worthwhile, that you will be appreciated and valued by our society. I will continue to push for the changes to be expedited and work with the government to improve access and flexibilities to the system for the families and the children of Warringah. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  It's an absolute pleasure to rise today to speak on the resumption of debate for the second reading for the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Cheaper Child Care) Bill 2022. It is an absolute pleasure because for nine years in this place my colleagues and I, on this side of the House now, called for dramatic change to child care to ensure that families in electorates like mine, in electorates like the member for Canberra's, could have the economic reform that would not just see child care provided better on the ground in our electorates and for our communities but would see a structural change that would mean improvement in gender equity and improvement in retirement incomes for women. The economic reform that is in front of us inside this bill has implications across decades. It is good for families, it is good for women, it is good for children and it is good for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here representing the seat that has the highest number of children in early childhood care and education in the country. There are 10,800 families in my electorate for whom this is excellent news. It's also cost-of-living action from this government that they can bank on that will save 10,800 families in my electorate. It's an extraordinary piece of legislation and a well thought out piece of legislation. It's a policy that addresses so many things, because it was developed thoughtfully by this government to impact on the economy, to make people's lives better and to ensure that we're talking about not just care for children but also quality education for children and the kind of interventions that we know are necessary for our youngest to be given the best start in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an extraordinary day, and in my electorate early education and care takes various forms. Lots of families access family day care, and I've stood in this place many times across the last nine years to talk about the impacts of the former government's policies on that sector—pre-COVID, let alone during COVID. It's about the families who are accessing long day care through the hundreds of early learning and childcare centres in my electorate. Like most people on this side, I want to pay some homage to the people in my community who are working in this sector. It's a place that I visit often and, as an educator—having originally trained in and, for most of the decades I worked in education, worked at the secondary school level—my admiration for people working in the early years, as you can imagine, is extraordinary. Year 9s may take some work to engage, but they don't quite require the same levels of patience. I pay tribute to those workers, and not just for the care, for the nurturing, for the scraped knees and for working through with children how to play together and work together—not just for the things we all think of when we think about early education and care—but also for the planning that goes into ensuring every child in that centre is reaching their milestones. I thank them for the training that they've been doing in early education to ensure that they have the skills required to keep this sector going. I thank them, most importantly, for their work across the pandemic, when uncertainty didn't stop them from delivering for my local families and families across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a cost-of-living measure, it's an economic reform, and it also has some really important points to note. It puts measures in place that will deter fraud, something that has plagued this sector and that we've seen headlines about. It's this government that's going to put in place things to ensure that the public perception of the sector improves. People will have assurance that those people in this sector who are acting against the best interests of our community will be stopped in their tracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also a really important piece of legislation because it supports First Nations children. It will provide additional support to First Nations children and families in accessing early childhood education and care. It will help close the gap in educational outcomes for First Nations children. Importantly, the bill provides 36 hours of subsidised early education and care a fortnight, regardless of activity level. This is absolutely critical to ensure that First Nations children can access early education and care, regardless of what's happening at home. This is important because in 2021 the Closing the Gap target to increase the proportion of First Nations children assessed as developmentally on track went backwards for the first time, and we need to turn this around. I note the shadow minister made the point that, in terms of children attending preschool, there have been improvements, but this is where the rubber hits the road. The proportion assessed as being developmentally on track went backwards. That's what early educators do every day—they are not just making sure that the children in their care are happy. They're doing more than making sure they are learning how to play. They're doing more than ensuring that they've had their lunch, their morning tea and perhaps their evening meal—in my electorate it's often the case that the children of shift workers are being looked after into late hours. They're doing much more than that. They're monitoring how far children are from milestones. They're putting steps in place to ensure that children reach those milestones, and, where children fall behind, they're working to ensure that they pick up that pace. This is extraordinary work. I don't think I'll be the only person in the chamber today to say it's extraordinary work—and work that should be paid more rather than less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the Prime Minister earlier say that this legislation will remove a structural disincentive for women to return to work for longer hours. The estimate is that this legislation could, in fact, create 36,000 effective full-time workers for this country. This is incredible structural reform that we are looking at here, and it is work that those opposite ignored; chose not to do. Let's face it: most of these aspects were in the public domain while those opposite were in government. They chose to ignore it. In fact, they chose to bring in legislation that supported people with multiple children but left out out-of-school-hours care. Everyone knows that you can be a mum working full time while your youngsters are in long day care and then have to hit the brakes because once they start school you are not getting support for out-of-school-hours care. So people actually work less sometimes when their child starts school. But those opposite chose to completely ignore out-of-school-hours care in the last piece of legislation they brought into this chamber—an extraordinary oversight; an oversight that was pointed out to them when we were in opposition, and they still chose not to change it and not to amend it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome hearing from the shadow minister that those opposite will support the legislation. I absolutely welcome them to walk into this chamber and vote for this legislation, because it is good policy, because it is good economics, because it is going to remove structural disincentives that are preventing women from earning as much as they could be and having that balance of being able to earn and look after their families. It's going to mean that women can make choices to ensure that their superannuation is building and growing at a higher rate. It has long been said by women in my family that husbands are not a superannuation package. I lived this firsthand in my family, having lost my father when I was in primary school. I watched my mum struggle on a single-parent pension with eight children from that day. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, we need women to earn their own living to ensure they can keep a roof over their own heads and their children's heads. This legislation goes some way to ensuring that, if you are a single parent, you are not going to be disadvantaged by a childcare system. It fixes the structural disadvantage. It supports families across the country. It supports our early learners. It supports the sector that we owe such a debt of gratitude to for their work during the pandemic and who were left abandoned twice by the then government during the pandemic without assurances, and who were left to tell families that they would not be able to attend, because they had gone past the number of days they could miss. Every time the former government played catch-up in that space, they hurt families in my community and they hurt this sector in my community. They actually risked people leaving the sector in a community like mine, where 11,000 families access early learning. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome this legislation. I can't wait for it to pass the parliament. I can't wait for it to come into law. It's budget day and this is great legislation that makes great economic sense as well as great educational sense. It really is a piece of work that I want to congratulate and commend the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Minister Aly, for her work in this space. Of course, I pay tribute to the member for Kingston for the work she did in this space across so many years, with support from many of us on this side of the chamber. And I pay tribute to those who worked in this space prior to that: the former member for Adelaide, who, on the day I became a member of parliament, began conversations with me about early education and child care in my community, and who was so versed in it. </span>

Paul came to Australia as a ten-pound Pom, sailing into Sydney on 19 April 1966. The very next day he caught a train to Wagga Wagga. After a few odd jobs, Paul settled as a journalist and worked for a range of outlets, both here and abroad, before going to work for the then Country Party. From 1978 to 2000 he held a range of senior roles within the New South Wales and federal Nationals. In 1983 Paul was appointed federal director and served for nearly a decade—our longest serving federal director to date. During his time as director he worked with five leaders: Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair, Charles Blunt, Tim Fischer and John Anderson. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Davey also held the history of the Nationals in his hand and protected it fiercely. He wrote eight books on the Nationals, including one of his final publications, <span style="font-style:italic;">Milestone: A Century of Achievement</span>, which has become a bible to each one of us here today. He was made a life member of the Nationals in 2002 and was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia in January 2019. Earlier this year Paul was awarded our highest award, the Earle Page Meritorious Service Award, for his service to the party, which was accepted on behalf of the family by his daughter Senator Perin Davey. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst everything he gave to the Nationals, Paul was also father to Jim, Perin and Chick; grandfather to their children; and husband to Lindie. Our thoughts are with the family during this time. Vale Paul Davey AM. </span>

Baha'i is Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority. They have enjoyed 40 years of relentless persecution solely because of their religious beliefs. In recent months it has been reported that there's been an escalation of persecution of Baha'is, with an increase in the number of arrests, the confiscation of land, and the destruction of property, including Baha'i cemeteries. People are being imprisoned and children are left separated from their parents. In June alone, 44 Baha'is were arrested, arraigned or imprisoned; 26 were handed a combined total of 85 years in prison. Young Baha'is are prevented from attending university. </span>

It seems that there is a methodical strategy by the Iranian government to eliminate the Baha'i religion. I call on the Iranian government, through their embassy here in Canberra, to cease the violations against Baha'is, to release those in prison, to drop the charges against them and to return their properties to them. </span>

True to form, Labor, at its first opportunity, has slashed this visionary program, round 6 of which would have benefited regional and remote Australia and my electorate of O'Connor. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government claims the program was pork barrelling. Minister, tell that to the communities across O'Connor that have benefited from the many, many projects funded under the previous five rounds. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has the most local government areas in any electorate in Australia. As minister for local government, Minister King should ask those 57 LGAs what they think of her decision. Feedback that I've received is they feel the minister's move is reprehensible. More than 20 LGAs and community groups in O'Connor prepared applications for round 6 of the fund. They all committed precious resources to the application process, which closed on 8 December 2021. In the country town of Corrigin, Juanita McGregor formed a group called 1922 &amp; You and spent 50 hours on an application to help restore a century-old community hall and create a youth mental health space. Ms McGregor's work and that of the committee she works with is now in vain, and the time-ravaged building is not getting any younger. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Recently I had the privilege of sharing morning tea with some of my constituents who have reached significant milestones relating to birthdays and wedding anniversaries and their families. It was a pleasure to have them join me and my team in our office to share cups of tea and enjoy home-baked scones. Many conversations were had alongside lots of laughs and storytelling. The morning gave me the opportunity to reflect on the word 'longevity'. Longevity means a long duration of individuals' lives, recognised as continuous. Longevity is the act of being steadfast. In most cases, if a person or people have been gifted longevity, they have fulfilled many acts of service. They have devoted themselves to servicing their families, their community and their country, and they are dutiful and loyal. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the morning tea I witnessed a collective of longevity in the room. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for attending and sharing their significant milestones with myself and my team. I congratulate the following celebrators: Mr Brian and Mrs Brenda Tredwell for their 60th wedding anniversary; Mr Neil and Mrs Robyn Thompson for their 60th wedding anniversary; Mr Darcy and Mrs Margaret McFarlane for their 60th wedding anniversary; Ms Eva Penson on her 100th birthday; Ms Catherine McMinimee on her 100th birthday; Mr Richard and Mrs Yvonne Busby for their 60th wedding anniversary; Mr James and Mrs Mary Pringle for their 60th wedding anniversary; Mr Bruce and Mrs Rhonda Barron for their 60th wedding anniversary; and Ms Minnie Smith for her 99th birthday.</span>

On 16 September 22-year-old Mahsa Amini was killed while in the custody of Iran's morality police. Her crime? Having hair visible under her headscarf. Mahsa's death has set off a wave of demonstrations and protests across the country, led by brave women who have had enough of the oppressive Iranian regime. Women, men and even school-age children have taken to the streets to demand equality and women's rights, chanting their motto—women, life, freedom. Iran's oppressive regime has responded to these peaceful protests with bullets. It is estimated that 222 protestors so far have been killed, some as young as 12. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a responsible global citizen, Australia must do more. We must join countries such as the US, the UK, Canada and European nations in placing sanctions on the Iranian morality police. Australia's silent support for the women of Iran is not enough. We must stand up and demand Iran's regime stop killing its people and extend full human rights to all of its citizens. It's time Australia stood up and did more to support men, women and children of Iran.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Someone can have a wisdom beyond their years. I was reminded of this fact when I visited Caulfield Grammar School's Malvern campus recently. The children were prepared for my visit and not only peppered but hammered me with searching questions. Question time is nothing compared to standing up in front of a class of grade 5s and 6s. I found myself answering a range of questions. From Davy: 'What impact do you make and how do you know you are making the right decisions?' Or from Hamish: 'What kind of problems do you solve?' Or from Jack: 'What are the negatives about being an MP?' Or from Edric: 'How often are you engaged in debate and do you like it?' To which I admitted that despite being a bit of an introvert by nature I found question time quite entertaining and a little bit fun. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then came a curly one from Siena: 'Have you ever disagreed with something your party said?' I was truthful and I said yes, I have, but when you're a member of a party like mine you work together and reach consensus. Working together is an effective way of getting things done; in fact it's the only way. I also said that being in government means you have to have a responsibility not only to your own electorate but to others' electorates. We need to make sure that our decisions don't adversely impact anyone else. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I left Caulfield Grammar I admired the gorgeous old buildings, the gardens, the playground and the many caring, dedicated teachers. I reflected again on how our children shape our future by challenging and questioning. </span>

In my electorate of Ryan, the median household—and that's thousands of families—will enter mortgage stress as these interest rate hikes are passed on. 'Mortgage stress' sounds abstract, but imagine if you were just making ends meet, having bought your first home on a low interest rate, maybe believing the RBA governor when he said then that interest rates wouldn't rise until 2024, and, bingo, you're now paying an extra $700, $800 or $1,000 a month. Where do you find that money? Wages aren't going up, but the cost of everything else is. This is all ostensibly to deal with inflation, but, when inflation is being driven by breakdowns in supply and corporate profiteering, how are interest rate hikes supposed to help?</span>

We're in a housing crisis, rents are skyrocketing and there's a criminal lack of supply of public housing, and yet the RBA is turning the screws on everyday people just trying to have a secure home. We need an immediate pause on interest rate hikes and we need genuine cost-of-living relief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Salisbury interchange level crossing is located along Park Terrace, a five-minute walk from my electorate office in Spence. In the wake of this great tragedy came great community togetherness. The Salisbury Train Crash Disaster Appeal Committee was soon established to raise funds to help the families of those impacted with expenses such as funeral costs. Residents dug deep, raising $30,000 to support this aim. Funds were also provided to commission a permanent memorial for the accident, made possible through grant funding provided to council by the South Australian Passenger Transport Board. I'm advised the sculpture designed by local South Australian artist Dave Clarke resembles a floral wreath, with four columns representing the lives lost that day—a touching tribute. We will remember them.</span>

From top students to cutting-edge entrepreneurs to doctors helping to cure cancer, I am proud to be their representative. They came here seeking a better life for their families, but I know that a piece of their heart aches over what is happening in their homeland. That is why last Saturday, in Melbourne, they turned out in their thousands in the pouring rain. They have done their part. It is now time for us to do ours.</span>

It's been two years since the untimely passing of Deputy President Kovacic, and it is fitting that the main Canberra hearing room has been named after him, after a career dedicated to cooperative workplace relations—or industrial relations, as many of us who were there would probably prefer. Before being appointed to the Fair Work Commission in 2013, John had enjoyed a long and successful career in the Australian Public Service and served numerous governments as a senior public servant, including as deputy secretary of the department in one of its many forms.</span>

In that role, on many occasions he used his particular skills to move the parties through conciliation, all too aware of the limited capacity for arbitration. A commission empowered to have greater conciliation and arbitration powers is well overdue. He was well loved by commission staff and had the respect of all the industrial parties.</span>

The announcement we made in 2019 to commit $110 million was actually matched by the Labor Party in an article dated 3 May 2019, which was entitled 'Bipartisan funding for roads' and included a picture of the then opposition leader, Bill Shorten. The Labor candidate for the seat said, 'Labor will commit to upgrading Wellington Road.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this road so important? Well, No. 1, at the moment it is a huge congestion issue and it is such a dangerous road for people to take. But, more importantly, in the case of a bushfire it is the major escape route for people living in Cockatoo, Gembrook, Emerald and also the Dandenong Ranges. If you go back in time to 1983, during the Ash Wednesday bushfires, locally 21 lives were lost. It is just so vital that this road get upgraded, and I am so disappointed and outraged that the funding is being cut. Previously, back in 2007, we committed $10 million for overtaking lanes. In 2010, sadly, we lost the election. My last letter before I lost my seat was to the then transport minister, Anthony Albanese, and it said, 'Please don't divert this funding.' Labor have again disgraced themselves when it comes to supporting the residents of the hills.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a local champion who sadly passed away last week. Chris Sharp—or Sharpie, as he was known to many of us—was one of those people I refer to as the BPs of the community—a quiet achiever. Chis never wanted or liked the limelight or being the centre of attention. He was much more comfortable behind a barbecue cooking a snag or helping youth at a Caboolture Rotary youth driver awareness program. Chris was a proud Rotarian and was always one of the first to put up his hand to volunteer at one of our many Rotary club events.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A passionate community man, Chris was also involved in assisting with practical solutions, such as the Wunya project, which provides clothing and non-perishable food for those doing it tough in the Caboolture community, as well as with the all-abilities play space at the CREEC project in Burpengary. Chris used his considerable business contact list, accumulated over a long career in local real estate, to obtain goods and services at either reduced or no cost for community projects, unashamedly embarrassing local businesses into giving back to the community that supported their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Always on the go, Sharpie continued a lawn-care business in retirement to stay busy after a back injury prevented him from partaking in his beloved golf at the Caboolture Golf Club, where I first met Chris over 20 years ago. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Chris's wife, Cheron, and the rest of his family. Rest in peace, Sharpie. You'll be missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to say a few words on the recent flood event that some in Victoria are still going through. My electorate was not spared. Over about 48 hours, Bendigo received 117 mils of water. Now, to people from Queensland, that doesn't sound like a lot, but for my town it is. The average rainfall for Bendigo in October is usually 41 mils. After receiving that volume of water in 24 hours, our rivers, creeks and road systems did not cope. The damage to local infrastructure was enormous. Roads were washed away. Every single highway into Bendigo was severely damaged in some way. The Axedale bridge was gone; it has since been temporarily repaired, but there's a lot of work still to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't just our roads that copped it; there was also damage to a number of homes. Whilst not as bad as in Rochester and Echuca, who are still on alert, we did lose about 40 homes in Heathcote and a number in Marong. Many in my community feel lucky that it wasn't worse, but the damage sustained by local infrastructure is enormous, and local councils are still counting the cost. From Kyneton in the south all the way to Elmore in the north, it's hard to find someone that was not affected. The community has reacted to help those in need, but more needs to be done. What alarms me the most is that people know this is not the last significant flood event we will go through, and we need to stand with people to get better prepared for events in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  It's been nearly one month since I introduced a private members bill in this House that would ensure stronger penalties for cybercriminals and crack down on ransomware. Since that time, we've seen Medibank and MyDeal join Optus on the list of Australian companies being attacked by cybercriminals, literally impacting millions of Australians. Our ransomware bill, which is based on legislation we introduced in government earlier this year, would specifically reform criminal law to create a standalone offence and introduce tougher penalties for all forms of cyberextortion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the week after I introduced my private members bill, the Labor members on the selection committee banded together to block the bill progressing for further evaluation. We could have been putting this important deterrent in place this week. Instead, we've seen nothing from the Labor government when it comes to actually cracking down on cybercrime, and it's been nearly a month since the Optus incident. We know that the Minister for Government Services has been missing in action since Services Australia began auditing sensitive data from the Optus breach, and we know Medicare numbers were stolen as part of the Medibank incident. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a tardy and lacklustre performance from Labor's dedicated cybersecurity minister, who preferred to tweet about the AFL grand final rather than step up, when the first attack happened, to guide the Australian victims through ways to secure themselves from identity theft. Perhaps that lack of action stems from the fact the government has quietly moved responsibility for cybercrime to the Attorney-General.</span>

Diwali is among the most celebrated festivals in the world, and it has become a permanent fixture in the calendars of so many people across Victoria. This joyous festival is celebrated by a spectacle of lights using clay lamps, sparkles and—in India, I'm told—loads of firecrackers. In addition, families and friends gather to share food and sweets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diwali signifies the eternal triumph of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. It also plays homage to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Thus, I'd like to believe we are blessed to have this government's first budget during Diwali. Festivals like Diwali are celebrated with pomp and splendour by the large Hindu-Sikh-Jain community in my electorate. It is an opportunity to get together to celebrate our shared belief in the oneness of all and pray for health, wealth and happiness for everyone. Happy Diwali!</span>

I pay tribute to the members of parliament who are dealing with this with their constituents every day, knowing that the floodwaters do not discriminate. They attack the farms, the villages, the creeks and the rivers, and they leave damage untold, as has been outlined by the member for Bendigo. This is a tragedy that each family is facing, and it's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a week problem for all of them today. </span>

It especially discriminates against those who are probably living in low-lying areas, which in a lot of places are the poorest of areas—the lowest socio-economic areas. They are the people who I know this parliament and this government—we as a group—will defend and look after. We are thinking of you, and we are prepared to protect you as well as we possibly can. This callout also goes to those first responders who are out there without sleep, working on behalf of their communities every day. I send out a message to them from this parliament that we are with you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I can certainly attest to the words of the Prime Minister on early childhood education earlier today. I am pleased and proud of the fact that, due to the introduction of the cheaper childcare bill by the Minister for Education, early childhood education will become significantly cheaper for virtually every family in Hasluck. At a time when budgets are tight, this government has taken action that means about 5½ thousand families in Hasluck have another reason to smile. Indeed, over one million families will be smiling. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We campaigned on this issue, and the government is now delivering. In my electorate, it was an issue and a campaign promise that certainly resonated with voters. To some, this simply will be a welcome respite in a difficult economic environment. To others, it will mean more than that; it will be the difference between working or not working, or between child care and no child care. I remember meeting a nurse who is a young mother while I was doorknocking in Ellenbrook. She told me that she only worked night shifts, so that she could be at home during the day with her young ones. It didn't add up for her to work days and pay for child care. She was tired and stressed and obviously really needed support. If we are not here to help people in difficulty then why are we here? With this significant boost in early education funding, this government will deliver for people in Hasluck and across Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  It's been nine long years since Labor delivered a budget, and it's clear they still don't know what they are doing. The government's $4.5 billion childcare package will not deliver for families, workers or the sector. They have no plan for access, no plan for workers and no plan to address thin markets and childcare deserts. The Prime Minister simply wasn't listening this afternoon when I outlined that what I meant was: the coalition will not oppose this bill. He wasn't listening. We moved an amendment to point out the enormous faults in this legislation, for the benefit of our youngest Australians and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to be upfront with families and explain how they plan to increase access to services, when their policy will put high demand on a system already under pressure. There is no point in $4.5 billion in subsidies if families who need it most can't access care for their children. The government has failed to address current workforce shortages, which, from July next year, will put further pressure on educators. Without a plan to increase access and to increase the pipeline of educators and retain them in the sector, this policy will leave children worse off. They have not addressed the issues in the sector. They have not addressed access issues. They have not addressed workforce issues. There is not one new place for early childhood in this country, thanks to this Albanese government. </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 13 October 2022, of John Michael Spender KC, a former Member of this House for the Division of North Sydney from 1980 to 1990, place on record its acknowledgement of his significant contribution to the House in his ten years of service to the people of North Sydney and to Australia's foreign relations as Ambassador to France, Ambassador to Portugal and Morocco and special envoy to Cyprus, and tender its sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we mark the passing of John Spender, I'd like to begin by acknowledging his family who have joined us here today—not least, of course, the member for Wentworth, one of his daughters, who I'm sure the whole family is just as proud of as her dad was. While the rest of us are marking the passing of a distinguished former member, she is grieving the loss of her beloved father. I say to her: your father so fervently believed that your place was in here; your success in the election must have added such a glow to his final months and such pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To focus on John Spender's time as the member for North Sydney would be like choosing one element from what was a lifetime of accomplishment. He was a shadow minister, a barrister, an ambassador, a husband to Carla Zampatti and then to Catherine Spender. And, of course, he was a father, stepfather and grandfather. Throughout it all he was a man of decency, grace, reflection and good humour. He was also an upstanding member of the Liberal Party and the son of Liberal cabinet minister Sir Percy Spender, no less. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was broad in his engagement. In his first speech as an MP he reflected on his period at the bar. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have had the good fortune to act for quite a large part of that time … for trade unions and for trade union officials, and also to advise them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, he wasn't just part of a mould. John entered parliament understanding that, to quote him, 'the purpose of politics is to achieve results'. He knew life in government and life in opposition. He appreciated the good moments and didn't shy away from the harder ones, including crossing the floor on matters of principle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was sent as our ambassador to France when the relationship between our two nations was at a low ebb—not for the last time! John set about lifting it and he did so. The best indicator of how well he went was that the French government eventually conferred on him the Legion of Honour. As the French ambassador noted on that day:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Few people have the opportunity and privilege to live several lives in one lifetime, several careers in one professional destiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Spender was one of the few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We extend our condolences to his beloved Catherine; to his stepson, Alex; and to his daughters, Bianca and the member for Wentworth. To lose one parent is hard enough; for both to be gone in such a short space of time must be even more difficult. May you take some solace from the thought that they will always be a part of you and that, in its own way, your conversation with them will go on. A rich and full life is at an end. May John Spender rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:03</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his fine words and associate the opposition with this motion. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery today, and in the chamber, of members of John Spender's family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was born in 1935, the son of Jean and Percy Spender—a mother who was a crime fiction writer and a father who was, among many accomplishments, the principal architect of the ANZUS treaty. It's no wonder that John would become a man of words and deeds. Like his father, John's life would traverse the fields of law, politics and diplomacy. After completing studies at Yale whilst his father was Australia's ambassador to the United States, John returned home. In 1961 he became a barrister in Sydney. Highly respected and successful, he was appointed QC in 1974. Yet throughout the 1970s John had a political itch which needed to be scratched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politics tugged at John as it did his father. He had two unsuccessful spells at seeking office, later stating that preselection is one of the hardest things that one gets through—at least successfully. The door opened with the 1980 federal election and his winning the seat of North Sydney. John would join Malcolm Fraser's government in its last term and go on to serve under opposition leaders Andrew Peacock and John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a politician of principle from the start. Having seen economy-wide strikes and been involved in the legal work associated with the unions, John focused on industrial relations in his maiden speech. He expressed his profound sense of disquiet as to the whole system, and he described Australia's then industrial record as 'one of the worst in the industrialised world', especially for strikes, stoppages, bans and other forms of unrest. In opposition, John held several shadow ministries, most notably those of aviation and defence support under Andrew Peacock and those of the Attorney-General and foreign affairs under John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A newspaper profile in 1986 noted that John's idea of a successful Liberal performance was 'a radical lowering of the income tax base, radical cuts in government expenditure and a rolling back of trade union power'. More humorously, the same piece said: 'He is both flamboyant and conservative enough to get up the collective noses of the Labor Party, fair-minded and fun-loving enough to laugh uproariously at a joke by political rival Paul Keating and perhaps intelligent enough to be resident philosopher in a John Howard led government.' John's political accomplishments were many, but he's remembered by most Australians for being a champion of press freedom, leading the charge on reforms to parliamentary privilege to abolish the offence of defamatory content. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In testimony to his direct way with words—and a mind to match—John, as the Prime Minister pointed out, was appointed as Australia's ambassador to France in 1996. There, he set about what he described as repair work. That he did, re-weaving links, re-establishing connections and restoring trust, being awarded the French Legion of Honour for his efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the death of his father, Percy, John would say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The loss of a great man is not simply an occasion for sadness, although grief is inseparable from the event; it is a time for public remembrance and thanks and for rejoicing in a life which has been richly spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as the son said that of his father, we can say the same of the father's son. In summing up John's life, we need only turn to the touching words of the Spender who has followed in her family's footsteps. The member for Wentworth described her father as a man 'who reflected on the world, always questioned it, loved good conversation and was gracious to the end'. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to John's colleagues and to his family and friends, especially his wife, Catherine; stepson, Alexander; and daughters, Bianca and Allegra. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:08</span>):  Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak today. My father was a gracious man. He built relationships across the House, and he would have been particularly gratified by the graciousness of the Prime Minister in proposing this motion and the Leader of the Opposition in speaking on it. He was many things—he was loving, he was extravagant, he was generous, he was droll, he was fun—but the lessons that I take from his life in this place are courtesy, originality and standing for something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many remembrances have noted that he was a gentleman, that he was gracious and that he was gentle. Whether he was representing a union, as he so often did, or accepting the apology of a prime minister—this time Hawke, who publicly mocked him for his accent but later, as a true gentleman, apologised—he was courteous. In parliament, I'm told, he played the ball, not the person. He took this gentleness home, and he never shouted at us, but when he was very irritated he would take himself for a drive. Now, I think he just liked cars!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wasn't afraid to think differently and was genuinely interested in alternative views. He and his father spent many Sunday afternoons debating the events of the day with a whiskey, and he encouraged us as kids to do the same—without the whiskey. You could change his mind with a good argument. This is a rare quality and quite the opposite, I think, of Twitter. No doubt it was that open-mindedness that enabled him to support my campaign despite being perhaps the first party person in a safe seat to be dislodged by a community Independent, as he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He held many roles in this House, which you have acknowledged. He was Manager of Opposition Business, shadow Attorney-General, shadow minister for foreign affairs and—my personal favourite—opposition spokesperson for the status of women. However, in reflecting on his political career he was proudest of the times that cost him—where he stood up, however quixotically. He crossed the floor to protect witnesses to access justice. He wrote a piece against his own government's foreign policy that was then quoted by the opposition leader. And he defended Laurie Oakes's right to call politicians 'drunks and bludgers', which led to the parliamentary privilege reforms that allow the press to call us, frankly, many other things now—for which, I'm sure, they are extremely grateful!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then it was over. I remember the day that he lost his seat: sitting together at breakfast, writing a list of things that we could do now that he was out. It was a very difficult time for him, rebuilding his life outside of this place. I learned from him then: 'When you're in parliament, make the most of it; you don't have a second to lose. But remember that one day you will be out—that it will be over—and be ready for that too.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-five years ago my father gave a condolence speech in the House for his father, my grandfather, who also served in federal parliament. There is a certain poignancy in that—though if any of my children stand for parliament I'll know it will be time to get my affairs in order! I would like to finish with a quote from that condolence motion, a favourite of my grandfather's which seemed apt for dad too: 'I have tried to do my duty. No-one can do more; no-one should do less.' I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  Natural disasters are a cruel part of life on this unforgiving continent. Tragically, the floodwaters in Victoria and New South Wales have claimed the lives of six of our fellow Australians. Our first thoughts today are with their loved ones. All Australians offer you our deepest sympathy in this time of grief and sorrow. Today, while some communities have begun the clean-up, there are many people in regional Victoria and New South Wales for whom the danger has not yet passed. As we speak, people in Echuca, Moama, Moree—where the Premier has been this morning—Shepparton and Kerang are still preparing for the worst. To all Australians in those areas still at risk: we are thinking of you. Please listen to the warnings, please follow the advice of the authorities, please do everything you can to keep yourself and your family safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, so often the worst of nature brings out the best of the Australian character. In recent days I've had the privilege of seeing this firsthand. In Deloraine, in Tasmania, I met with council workers and emergency services personnel calmly coordinating the flood response and recovery. I thank the member for Lyons, who joined me there that day, along with the mayor, Wayne Johnston; the captain of the Deloraine Kangaroos, Lochie Dornauf, and the club president, John Jordan; and other members and volunteers who had come to help out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Latrobe, Michael Perkins, a dairy farmer, spoke to me about the long-term challenge of climate change and its consequences that he had seen firsthand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria at the emergency response centre in Bendigo, assistant chief officer Mark Cattell talked me through the huge amount of work they were doing. I thank the member for Bendigo, who has been so diligent in looking after the interests of her community. There, they were doing everything from flood mapping to distribution of sandbags to coordinating food supplies and emergency accommodation. So many people working there were from other agencies across the state who had mobilised to join the relief effort. I joined with the Premier of Victoria to look at towns like Rochester, which had been inundated. As we were flying over in a chopper, tragically, we could see two cars going through extensive floodwater. Again, a reminder for us here to remind people: 'Don't risk it. You don't know what's below the floodwater.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Forbes in New South Wales at the rural fire service station, which has been converted to the SES base, we were briefed on the response before Deputy Mayor Chris Roylance drove us around to point out the areas affected and at risk. I thank the member for Riverina and the Premier of New South Wales for being with us there. We also flew into Parkes, which has had less impact but some from the floods, particularly around farms across the whole of the Riverina district. I had the chance to speak with local farmers and residents outside the council chambers about how everyone can ensure everyone can access the support that is on offer. The member for Riverina will, like me, I think, never quite forget the sight of a friend of his, Grahame Ruge, in gumboots and a Hawaiian shirt, who nearly had to wade across the street, down the street and across a bridge that was flooded to talk to us about what his local town and community are going through. Like everyone we met there, Graham wasn't thinking about himself. Even though his place was right next to the river, he was thinking about other people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across at-risk areas in Victoria and New South Wales, emergency services personnel and local volunteers are receiving vital assistance from members of the ADF. Approximately 350 ADF personnel have been working in Victoria. They have been building levees, filling sandbags and using two CH-47 Chinook helicopters to transport SES water rescue, army medics and stores to Shepparton and Echuca. Another 200 members of the ADF are available to assist in New South Wales, with 100 already on the ground in Moree, Dubbo, Condobolin, Deniliquin and Hillston. I also thank the member for Parkes, whom we talked with over the weekend, about any further support that can be given on the ground. I know that he is very concerned. He was unable to get to Moree on Saturday to see his local community. Another 100 ADF personnel are standing by to help in the Northern Rivers and Lismore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know all members of the House will join me in recognising and thanking everyone on the front line of this disaster. I thank the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, for the extraordinary work he has been doing day in, day out in coordinating, along with Brendan Moon and the people in the department, the response to this. It can't be said enough: in hard times Australians are simply magnificent. They're brave in the face of adversity, they're calm amidst uncertainty and they're driven by an instinctive decency to look after each other. I think you see something particularly special in some of these smaller regional towns—that sense of belonging to each other. Everyone knows everyone and everyone is helping out. When disaster strikes, Australians mobilise quickly and decisively. They work together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same spirit, we are working quickly with state premiers and with local members from across the parliament and with local councils to make sure people are getting the support and resources they urgently need. Australian government disaster payments are available to people across the areas affected. As of Sunday more than $20.6 million in assistance has already been provided to around 25,000 people in those three states. Services Australia is also working on practical things like making sure families who miss days of child care don't have to pay for those absences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the states, particularly the three premiers of Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales, for their ongoing engagement and for the way that there is seamless cooperation between the Commonwealth, state and local governments jointly funded under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements, so that we can respond quickly to needs on the ground for clean-up and repairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an inescapable fact that natural disasters have become more frequent and more intense. It's what the science told us would happen. That's why it's so important that disaster recovery funding also supports efforts for better planning, for building back in such a way that it makes communities safer and more resilient so that the next time disaster strikes we are better prepared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that the rains stop soon and the waters recede. But the briefings that I've had—and I know the opposition have received briefings as well—indicate that we're not at the end of this. We're more towards the beginning, probably, than we are towards the end. So there are difficult weeks and, perhaps, even months ahead. The long-term consequences are severe for our economy; for agriculture that was anticipating a bumper season there in the Riverina, the Goulburn Valley and other parts of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, Tasmania. It has been particularly heartbreaking for the farmers who were looking forward to something so positive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people, of course, have lost their homes and others, of course, have lost their lives. The most important thing for people is to stay safe, to make sure that they follow the advice when it's given. If you're asked to evacuate please do so. The authorities are acting upon the advice of the experts. We will, as a government, continue to offer every support possible. I'm sure that that will be offered in a bipartisan way, and I thank the opposition for that. All we can do is to do what we can as a parliament to today say that we stand in solidarity with those people going through this difficult time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  Flood, fire and drought are an inevitable part of living in our country. We don't always know where natural disasters will strike, only that they will. That inevitably does nothing, though, to diminish the shock and the sadness of the crushing news that Australians have lost their lives during these latest floods. On behalf of the coalition, we express our heartfelt condolences to the families who have tragically lost loved ones in these floods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an incredibly tough time for people in Victoria, in New South Wales, in Tasmania and in Queensland. As we know, in some places, thankfully, the waters are receding, but in other places they're rising. Australians are entering, going through or emerging from their darkest hours. Yet it's in these darkest hours that we witness the very best of the Australian character—our courage, our compassion and the camaraderie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very honoured to be in Shepparton last week with the member for Nicholls to see those qualities on display firsthand. Many of those in the local community were instrumental in supporting the effort to respond and to recover, people who are volunteers, just ordinary Australians working for GV Cares and the Salvos, distributing food and necessities to families who were isolated and had gone without—people like Azem Elmazs, who shut his restaurant and had been cooking meals with his wife for workers, volunteers and affected residents. I want to praise, acknowledge and thank all of those across the nation who are doing such fine work: the emergency service workers; the police—the first responders, who always come to the aid of communities—especially those who have crossed borders to help their brothers and sisters in uniform; the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, who answer the call on every single occasion, injecting hope and confidence when they move into towns; and the local councillors, the community leaders and the volunteers who assist others while their own homes have been inundated. Your combined efforts have seen people rescued, food and medical supplies provided to those cut off, and homes and businesses saved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly acknowledge the efforts of the members for Parkes, Riverina, Lindsay, Mallee, Farrer, Braddon and Bass, who are currently supporting or have in recent times supported their communities due to flooding. For those Australians facing the prospect of rising waters: please continue to heed the advice of emergency services, especially given rain forecasts and a likely wet summer ahead. Long after the waters have receded, the clean-up has commenced and the cameras have moved on, communities will need ongoing support for the slow and costly recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the work of former prime minister Morrison and the emergency service ministers who put in place the regime that Prime Minister Albanese referred to before. The support that we provide to communities, hand in glove with our state counterparts and local government authorities, makes a real difference in the hours, days, weeks and months after these natural disasters. Infrastructure and homes will need to be rebuilt, fences replaced and roads repaired. In the aftermath of a disaster, Australians can feel like they're on their own and like they've been forgotten by governments. The coalition encourages governments at all levels to be generous in the assistance they offer, and we provide our bipartisan support to the Prime Minister and the government to see that support delivered in an effective way to those affected by this natural disaster, not just in the current response phase but also in the all-important recovery phase over the days, months and, in some cases, many years ahead.</span>

Australia is and will remain a steadfast friend of Israel. We have reaffirmed Australia's previous, longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved as part of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. It's the same position that is held by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Canada. It's the same position that was held by John Howard, the same position that was held by Tony Abbott, and the same position that was held—</span>

And what happened in 2018 was there was a by-election held in the electorate of Wentworth, and they said that they would change what had been a bipartisan position since the creation of Israel in 1948. They said that, but, once they got through the election, they didn't follow it through. They didn't move the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Say what you like about Donald Trump, at least he followed it through. At least he followed through the position. Those opposite did not, thereby showing that this was not a decision of substance. It was a decision of gesture. What we need in the Middle East to secure peace is substance, not gestures. We need peace in the Middle East to be based upon a two-state solution which recognises the right of Israel to exist in secure borders and also recognises the rights of the Palestinian people. My government will not waiver in our support of Israel or of the Jewish community in Australia. We're also unwavering supporters of the rights of the Palestinian people. What we need is a solution to the Middle East, not playing domestic politics during a by-election in order to secure a so-called advantage.</span>

Those opposite wasted a decade, but we are not wasting a day, and in tonight's budget you will see being delivered what Australians voted for: cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, paid parental leave, more affordable housing, fee-free TAFE—a responsible budget right for the times and ready for the future. These reforms take pressure off family budgets without adding to inflation. Australians have been waiting for a responsible, reforming budget for a decade and tonight they will see one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After nine years of those opposite deliberately keeping wages low, we're getting wages moving again. You'll see some more action on that at the end of the week. After nine years of division and denial and dysfunction on energy policy, we're lifting Australia's ambitions on climate change and we're investing in renewable energy. After nine years of telling Australia's manufacturers to leave the country, we want a future made in Australia and we'll support manufacturers in this country. After nine years of shameful neglect in aged care, we're taking action to fix the crisis. After nine years of sordid scandals from those opposite, we're going to have the National Anti-Corruption Commission funded in this budget. After nine years, we're also working to bring Australians together. That's why we did the Jobs and Skills Summit—to move towards having solutions, not look towards just having arguments. Those opposite were obsessed by conflict, trying to divide people. They acted like an opposition in exile while they were on the government benches, and now what's very clear is that they've learnt absolutely nothing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just before question time we were dealing with the childcare legislation, and those opposite are just beside themselves, saying we weren't listening. They attacked it the whole way through, and then they said, 'Oh, but maybe we won't oppose it.' Well, they should get out of the way, because what you'll see from tonight's budget is a responsible budget that takes pressure off the cost of living and is family friendly without putting pressure on inflation.</span>

The shadow minister issued a release saying that this was a sweetheart deal between us and the Victorian government. This was an announcement made by the Prime Minister and me in Hobart with the Liberal Premier of Tasmania. The shadow minister said this was a sweetheart deal with Dan Andrews. He wasn't there. I'm not sure where the opposition thinks the Marinus Link goes from Victoria—the Antarctic, maybe! I'm really not sure what they think. We don't know what they think about many things. We know what this government's getting on with: the task of rebuilding the energy system in our country after 10 years of denial and delay is what we're getting on with.</span>

                  </a>  The budget will include over 760 initiatives for regional Australia. In my own portfolio it will include the Bass, Tasman and Tamar highways in Tasmania; freight roads in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory; Mandalong Road and the Muswellbrook bypass in the Hunter; jetties up in the Torres Strait; logistics and industrial hubs in Gippsland, in Townsville—I see the member interjecting—and in the Northern Territory; and cultural and sporting precincts in Alice and in Kalgoorlie. It will include two new regional programs: the Growing Regions Program and the partnerships and precincts program—a billion dollars to be invested over the next three years into regional communities across this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget, of course, ends the decade of waste and rorts and cleans up the mess that has been left by the Liberal and National parties. It fixes the legacy of infrastructure projects that the previous government announced, with great fanfare, but was actually unable to deliver. It ends the mess of grants programs that saw rampant politicisation and deserving communities across this country miss out.</span>

Unlike the National Party, we don't believe the regions are only worthy of funding if they elect a National Party member. Our fairer and transparent regional investments will make sure they are delivered across the country.</span>

Every single portfolio has a role to play, and that's why the budget tonight will deliver amongst the largest investments in regional communications that we have seen, along with the Powering the Regions Fund, the regional first homebuyer guarantee, investments in First Nations communities and, of course, defending and protecting the sustainability of the NDIS and Medicare, on which our regions so fiercely rely.</span>

We certainly understand the potential of the North West Minerals Province, to go to the specifics in his question. I had a meeting with Andrew Forrest just last week. He is very passionate, as are other people in the business community, about the opportunities that are there for new critical minerals right around the country; north-west Queensland, in particular, has an extraordinary opportunity to advance. </span>

                  </a>  Twice, that's right! You've got to go back there because it's unforgettable as a location. That new link will spark significant investment along the transmission corridor, like the $2.6 billion Mount James wind farm already proposed for Hughenden. We look forward to working with the Queensland government on how we can best support the Queensland Energy and Jobs Plan. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week the Minister for Resources and I announced the development of a new national Critical Minerals Strategy, which will set out a clear vision for our growing critical minerals sector. Critical minerals, including rare earths, are crucial components in batteries, electric vehicles and solar panels, and Australia has some of the largest reserves. Since being elected, the government has committed $100 million to directly support new critical minerals projects, including Alpha HPA, EQ Resources and Lava Blue in Queensland. We will also invest $1 billion in resources value-adding and mining science through the National Reconstruction Fund. I think many of the proposed initiatives in north-west Queensland will be eligible for that and will benefit from this investment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see our critical minerals processed on shore as well. I don't want to see them all shipped off, then value-added and then imported back. We need to look at ways in which we can value-add here, taking advantage of the fact that we can be a renewable energy superpower for the world. That means not only investing in transmission, in solar and in wind generation, but also developing the regions, including manufacturing in north-west Queensland; that absolutely holds the key to our clean energy future. I very much look forward to continuing to work with the member for Kennedy in a constructive fashion. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know that he's very committed to relieving the cost of living for Australians by reducing the cost of early childhood education and care and making sure that children in the electorate of Solomon, particularly First Nations children in the electorate of Solomon, get the very best possible start to life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to affordable early childhood education and care is a vital part of a child's early years of development, but it's also critical to our economy, and that' s why a Labor budget will deliver on our commitment, the commitment that we went to the election with, to make early childhood education and care more affordable for 1.26 million Australian families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our reforms come after years of inaction from those opposite, with fees going through the roof by 41 per cent over the past eight years. We've listened. We've listened to Australian families. We've listened to parents. We've listened to the mothers who want to go back to work, who want to take on extra hours, who want to have career progression, who want to go back to study, and we are delivering on cost-of-living relief directly in this family-friendly budget. This is not welfare. It is meaningful economic relief that gives families greater choice. In the words of former South Australian premier and the director of Thrive By Five, Jay Weatherill, 'For our economy, more affordable child care will help unlock the power of parents' workforce participation, particularly mothers, which would in turn help address the labour shortages we're currently experiencing across the country.' And that includes workforce issues in early childhood education and care. Treasury estimates that these measures will increase the hours worked by women with young children up to 1.4 million hours per week in 2023-24. That's the equivalent of around 37,000 full-time workers, and that's going to make a real difference to our economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these reforms will only be possible if we are retaining, recruiting and training a high-quality early childhood education workforce. The Albanese government is committed to wage growth, including for the critical early childhood education and care workforce. That's why we successfully argued for a rise for the lowest-paid workers in Australia—and I remind the House that those opposite opposed that; they didn't want that. That's why we're committed to addressing the gender pay gap and we'll strengthen the ability of the Fair Work Commission to order pay rises for underpaid women workers. But Australians understand this. They understand that we didn't create the challenges ahead of us, but they elected us to take responsibility for addressing them, and that's exactly what we're doing. </span>

I want to acknowledge the students from Albion Park High School in my electorate who have come down to Canberra today to witness the passage of the first Albanese Labor government budget. The reason that we need a responsible government is there in the gallery; it's about their future, not about our future. It's about ensuring that they inherit a society in which they can put their aspirations and their dreams into practice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Framing a budget in October 2022 is not going to be easy. International headwinds are against us. In the United States, Europe and Great Britain, we see inflation galloping ahead and economies sliding into recession. Australia is better set than most of those economies, but we are not immune to the impacts of what goes on amongst our major trading partners. Of course, it's not just the international economy and the international impacts that are going to make it challenging for us to frame a budget, because we have inherited an absolute fiscal mess from this mob on the other side—</span>

Our investment in skills, our investment in manufacturing, our investment in education and our investment in energy and a clean energy future will set this country up for the future.

We are walking out to the crease late in the match, because we are making up for a decade of doing nothing when they were in office, so now we have to work faster to reduce emissions by 2030. And, yes, those figures I quoted were correct. They underline the size of the task. They underline the size of the task of transmission, and I welcome questions on transmission, because this government has delivered a deal with the government of Tasmania and the government of Victoria. Those opposite talked about it for six years, and we delivered it in six months. You are going to see more of that type of action tonight, tomorrow and next week as well.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, we will deliver on that promise. Tonight's budget will deliver the largest ever cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, bringing the maximum co-payment for millions of general patients down from $42.50 to just $30 per script. For households that fill two or three scripts every month, and there are many of those, that will deliver a saving of as much as $300 or even $450 each and every year. That's not just good for their hip pockets at a time of enormous cost-of-living pressures; we know it's also good for their health, because almost a million Australians every year go without filling a script that their doctor has said is important for their health because they simply cannot afford it. Pharmacists tell stories of their customers coming in with a handful of prescriptions asking for advice about which script they can go without, because they can't afford to fill them all. Our delivery of that promise tonight will make that choice redundant for millions of Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this responsible cost-of-living relief measure, we will also continue listing life-saving and life-changing medicines onto the PBS. On the weekend, I announced four new listings of medicines like that. From next week, around 1,000 skin cancer patients will be able to access Libtayo at PBS prices, rather than $144,000 per course of treatment. More than 500 lung cancer patients will have access to new life-saving and life-changing medicines. I was especially delighted to be able to announce the listing of Crysvita, the first new treatment in decades for a rare but debilitating condition, X-linked hypophosphataemia, or XLH, which affects more than 200 Australians. I was joined at the announcement by Talia, who is 11, by Noah, who is 12, by their families and by Sandy, the President of XLH Australia, an outstanding advocate for her community. Talia has access to Crysvita on the community access program, and it has completely changed her life. Her family told us about being able to witness her deliver her first 100-metre sprint at her school, and how proud they were of that. Noah, who is 12 and an avid Crows fan, hasn't had access on the community access program, but, from next week he will be able to access this medicine that will give him an enormously different life to what he was facing before this listing. The lives of those families and more than 200 others will be profoundly changed by this listing at PBS prices, rather than $360,000, which is what this medicine would have cost without the PBS. </span>

RGS, a proudly Australian owned and operated manufacturer in my electorate, had a power bill under the coalition of around $39,000 last year. This year, their power bill under Labor will spike to around $73,000, an increase of $43,000—just one of the many cost increases seen by businesses in Longman this year. When will the government deliver on its promise to cut power bills?</span>

I welcome the fact that honourable members opposite are now somehow interested in energy prices. They weren't very interested when they were changing the law to hide the increase in energy prices for Queensland businesses. Queensland businesses will benefit from our policies to introduce renewable energy and introduce to transmission—which now apparently the opposition is opposed to—the Integrated System Plan—</span>

I recognise that, along with many families, he is acutely aware of the challenges but also the joys of parenthood as a result of the recent arrival of baby Macaulay. So I take this opportunity to congratulate him.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting families is a key plank of the Albanese government's first budget. Increasing paid parental leave was one of the most frequent proposals raised to boost workforce participation at our recent Jobs and Skills Summit, because boosting paid parental leave not only better supports families at the time of the birth of a baby but also is critical to supporting women's workforce participation. Of course, the Albanese government has listened and responded in this budget to be delivered tonight, which will include the biggest expansion to paid parental leave since Labor introduced it in 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, the government has responded to the calls of many families to make sure that this scheme is modern and strengthened and actually meets the flexibilities that many families need. That's why the changes that we will make in the budget tonight will give more than 180,000 families more choice about how they balance work and family. From 1 July 2023, we will implement changes to modernise paid parental leave and make it more accessible for both parents. We will move to a single scheme that will allow all parents to access government paid leave at the same time as employer paid leave. Currently, this is available only to mums, not dads. We will encourage families to share care, with an easier claiming process that will allow either parent to take leave first and removes the assumptions about mothers and fathers being both primary and secondary carers. We will expand the eligibility with a more generous household income test of $350,000, which families can be assessed under if they exceed the individual income test of around $156,000. Then, from 1 July 2024, we will add two additional weeks a year until the scheme reaches 26 weeks in July 2026.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are positive changes that will make families' lives better. The Albanese government's new Paid Parental Leave scheme will be good for parents, good for kids, good for women, good for employers and good for the economy. This is just one of the many measures that the Albanese government is taking through our budget to make it better, fairer and stronger for Australian families.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  I want to thank the member for Clark for his question. I know that he, like many people in this place, is concerned about those Australians who are struggling to find safe and secure housing, particularly affordable housing at the moment. We certainly understand that safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. We want every Australian to have the security of having a roof over their head but, of course, we're dealing with increasing housing affordability costs. Far too many Australians are being hit by increasing rents, and far too many Australians are still struggling to purchase a home. Sadly, far too many Australians are facing, or at risk of, homelessness today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation is completely unacceptable, which is why, of course, we've hit the ground running to deliver on our ambitious housing reform agenda that we took to the election. It was a very significant reform right across the housing system. Indeed, we want to make it easier for Australians to buy a home. We want to increase the supply of housing to reduce overcrowding and to reduce rents. We want to improve access to social and affordable housing, and we want to address the needs of those who find themselves at risk of homelessness or who are indeed homeless. Importantly, we want to ensure that investments and reforms are both long term and sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, we've brought forward the start of the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to 1 October, and that will allow up to 10,000 eligible Australians to enter into homeownership sooner and help ease the pressure in the rental market in our regions. We've acted quickly to unlock up to $575 million through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to invest in more social and affordable housing sooner. Of course, we're doing that while we wait for the Housing Australia Future Fund, which is our significant $10 billion investment that will build 30,000 new social and affordable homes in the first five years.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Speaker—on relevance. The community's very keen to hear the answer—in particular regarding the National Rental Affordability Scheme, or NRAS; Commonwealth rent assistance; and whether there's any possibility of investment property tax reform. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms COLLINS:</span>
                  </a>  I thank the member for Clark. We also, of course, want to develop a National Housing and Homelessness Plan, and we do want to work with the other tiers of government. There's no one tier of government that's going to be able to solve this alone. We've had two meetings already of state and territory housing ministers. The first, which we had in July, was the first meeting in almost five years because, of course, we inherited a system where those on the other side did very little when it came to housing affordability across this country. We're also going to introduce a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to ensure that the Commonwealth does play a leadership role in ensuring housing supply and improving housing affordability. There'll be details on these reforms in the budget tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the initiatives and reforms need to be sustainable and lead to long-term, permanent housing for those that need it most. We learnt the lesson the hard way from those opposite when we saw important housing programs abolished, like one of the ones the member refers to. NRAS was abolished, of course, by Tony Abbott back in 2014. The reforms that we're proposing will permanently boost the supply of affordable housing and take pressure off the rental market as well as addressing social housing problems. When too many Australians don't have a safe place to call home, we can't afford to waste a day, and we absolutely won't.</span>

When those opposite, and anyone, want to talk about cost of living, cost of living deals with both prices and wages.

Those opposite couldn't even bring themselves to support a $1-an-hour increase for the lowest paid. They said it would be economy wrecking. They said it would be a disaster.

The only words of the legislation they're sure of are the name—'Secure jobs, better pay'—and that was enough for the Leader of the Opposition to say: 'Vote against it. You can't have that.' 'Secure jobs, better pay' was enough for it to be vetoed. At least they're being consistent: in opposition, they are intending to do exactly what they did in government, which is to suppress wages, try to prevent wages from going forward and try to prevent improvements in people's pay. The Leader of the Opposition had a moment of clarity when he said, with reference to the government, 'They've been elected to make a bad situation better.' He's right: they left us with a bad situation. He's right: wage stagnation for a decade has been a terrible outcome for households. This government is determined to make that better and, if those opposite don't support secure jobs or better pay, they should continue on their current course.</span>

Twenty-two thousand small businesses in South-East Queensland, including many businesses in my community, are currently on electricity standing offers. Instead of their electricity bills falling, as those opposite promised, they are set to increase by up to $1,700. Why is the government making the cost-of-living crisis worse for small-business owners? </span>

I imagine she was outraged by my predecessor hiding the 12.8 per cent increase in energy prices for Queensland businesses prior to the election. I imagine she is outraged that the minister actually changed the law by signing a regulation to hide this increase, which he was told was inevitable by the Australian Energy Regulator. I am sure she shares my anger. I am sure she shares my disrespect. I am sure she shares my disdain for such an action—to be so fundamentally dishonest to Queensland small businesses.</span>

The honourable member well knows that the plan that we took to the election was to take energy to renewables 82 per cent by 2030, to put downward pressure on energy prices and to build the transmission network right across the country.

The Albanese government was elected on a platform of a better future for all, irrespective of whether you live in our cities, our suburbs or our regions. We are delivering on our commitments to connect Australian families, businesses and communities better than ever before.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing $2.4 billion to give an additional 1.5 million premises fibre access to the National Broadband Network. What this means is that 90 per cent of homes and businesses in the NBN fixed-line footprint will have access to gigabit speeds by late 2025. What this includes is full fibre access for more than 660,000 additional homes and businesses in the regions currently relying on copper wire. This will boost the reliability of services and the productivity of our regional businesses, and support the changes in the ways we work, study and transact since the pandemic. What this means is that these additional fibre-to-the-premises connections will deliver an estimated $20 billion uplift in GDP by 2030. That enables communities and businesses to access faster broadband speeds and support thousands of jobs during the construction phase. But expanding access to optical fibre isn't just about downloads; it's about reliability and it's about resilience. It is about our global competitiveness. It builds on our delivery of $480 million earlier this year to upgrade the NBN fixed wireless network. What this means is a more consistent and reliable service for more users in the household.</span>

                  </span>Not too long ago I had the pleasure of visiting the farm of Peter and Megan near Weethalle with the member for Riverina. It was instructive to note how vital digital connectivity is to the operation of their farming enterprise, which, again, became all too relevant during the pandemic. But the approach taken by this government stands in stark contrast to the masterclass in economic and technological incompetence by those opposite. Those opposite rolled out a second-rate copper network beset by delays. They promised to build it for $29 billion. It went up to $41 billion, then $49 billion and, finally, came in at a staggering $58 billion—double what they promised! They ordered 60,000 kilometres of new copper—enough to wrap around planet Earth 1½ times—with taxpayers' money. In contrast, we're delivering better connectivity right across Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

With the federal government still considering whether to provide 50 per cent of the funding for the project, do you believe that spending up to $2½ billion to demolish a growing and thriving public school for a two-week sporting event is a good use of public funds?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member might be aware that today Medibank provided an update on the consequences of the breach of their networks and confirmed that cybercriminals have taken more data than was previously reported. The data that has been taken has been taken not just from the AHM and international student customer database, as they had previously thought, but from the broader Medibank systems. This is really not good news, and it's of great concern to the Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons the government is so worried about this is because of the nature of the data that has been held here. In a lot of cyberattacks, our big fears are around identity theft and financial crime—those are very difficult, complex and important cases, but, ultimately, something can usually be done to protect consumers. We can put in place credit monitoring, we can replace ID documents and we can replace bank cards. When it comes to the personal health information of Australians, the damage here is potentially irreparable. Australians who are struggling with mental health conditions, drug and alcohol addiction or diseases that carry some shame or embarrassment are entitled to keep that information private and confidential, and for a cybercriminal to hang this over the heads of Australians is a dog act. It is scum-of-the-earth, lowest-of-the-low territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are taking this incredibly seriously, and the work that is being done is being undertaken by the smartest and toughest people who work for the Australian government. I thank the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Federal Police for the intensive work that is underway to hunt down the attacker. They are undertaking a very significant operation. The AFP are leading a criminal investigation into this matter. Services Australia and the Department of Health and Aged Care are working to protect the government information that may be exposed here. Services Australia have done an immense amount of work to protect their own network, which has an interaction with Medibank as a health insurer. We are putting in place substantial supports for Australians should the worst come to the worst and some of this information be made public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the way that the situation developed over the weekend through Friday and Saturday, on Saturday I asked my department to activate the National Coordination Mechanism to coordinate the work that's being done on Medibank. As the parliament will know, the NCM was set up by the former government as a crisis response mechanism to deal with the most difficult and complex aspects of managing the pandemic. We are picking up that model. What we can see is that Medibank is just as complex and just as urgent as some of what we dealt with there. I believe the NCM has already met three times now, and it will work across state and federal agencies to coordinate the response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Combined with Optus, this is an enormous wake-up call for the country. Cybercriminals are the thugs of the 21st century—the bag snatchers and the armed robbers. We need to do more as a country to step up, but in the meantime this government is doing everything it can to protect Australians against this breach.</span>

The opposition knows, but doesn't like to acknowledge, that the Powering Australia Plan that we took to the Australian people and received a mandate for, outlines very clearly in the documents—and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it because she has attempted to table it—a plan to roll out our renewable energy investments, our transmission, over the coming years to 2030. It models the impact of those prices for 2025 and beyond—not 2022, not 2023, but 2025 and beyond. That is the fact. Never did the then opposition and now government say, 'We will come into office and we will be able to fix 10 years of delay and denial overnight.'</span>

He understands how important it is to invest in skills, which of course delivers to our economy, businesses and workers. It was clear to this government upon election that we needed to address this matter urgently. We were very conscious of the fact that the acute skills shortage was as bad as it possibly could be. In fact, the National Skills Commission report, the final report that was only released recently, showed that the occupations on the shortage list had almost doubled in 12 months, from 153 occupations to 286. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is really an indictment of the failure of those opposite to properly plan in the labour market. Of course the pandemic had some role to play in relation to shortages, but the reality is that so too did some of the policy prescriptions of those opposite, namely that the failure to provide any support, JobKeeper or JobSeeker, to hundreds of thousands of visa workers meant that they left the country in droves. That compounded the problem. So too did the failure to plan for the economy—to identify more clearly the existing shortages in the labour force and also, of course, anticipate areas of emerging demand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understood that. That was why the government convened the Jobs and Skills Summit quite quickly, convening a meeting of businesses and unions, of state and territory governments, of civil society to work through these issues, to discuss and then move on to respond immediately. And respond we will. For that reason we have announced the delivery of 180,000 TAFE and VET fee-free places for 2023. That is absolutely critical to supply the skills to the labour market, to those businesses crying out for workers with relevant skills, to those workers who want secure employment but need skills in demand. For that reason it's absolutely vital that people work together. That's the difference between those on this side, the government now, and the government that we saw before the election—a failure to engage properly with the business community, with unions and with others. That's the reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is we need to do this and we will do it as a matter of urgency. Of course, we have seen the transformation, for example, in the energy sector. That's why we're investing in energy apprenticeships—to make sure that we have the skills and that we are ready for that transformation, working together across government with employers and industry to deliver the skills that our economy, our labour market and this country need.</span>

I also want to take this opportunity to thank Minister Murray Watt for the work that he has done since entering government. We've had multiple natural disasters and we've had agricultural issues, and his swift response in mobilising the ADF and getting payments out so quickly should be congratulated. As a former mayor who experienced nine declared natural disasters in four years, I'm very aware of the important role that local governments play in supporting their communities through disaster but also into recovery. We're thinking of all those communities, particularly those in and around Lismore, who have felt multiple floods on numerous occasions already this year. We know you're fatigued, and we know it takes a toll on your communities.</span>

Heed their warnings and advice. We are working closely with state and territory governments to support those impacted local government areas and their communities to provide practical and timely on-ground assistance. People in local government areas affected by these floods can access disaster assistance payments through Services Australia. We currently have a bill before parliament that will transform the former government's failed Emergency Response Fund into a dedicated, ongoing source of funding for natural disaster resilience and risk reduction initiatives. Not only is it important to be there for communities at the time of disasters; it's important to be there to assist them to prepare for what's coming in the future, and that is what the Albanese Labor government is doing.</span>

That's what we're going to do. The previous government promised energy prices of $70 a megawatt hour. If you want to talk about energy prices, we'll talk about it all day. I'm free till 7.30. I think the Prime Minister's up for it as well by all indications, and we're very happy to keep debating this. We're very happy to keep explaining our plans. We're very happy to keep pointing out the decade of denial and delay on the other side and the dishonesty of the previous Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction.</span>

I also want to thank him for the work he's been doing in his community in light of the recent floods and also for his longstanding commitment to supporting small businesses in his community. We all know that small businesses are, indeed, the engine of our nation's economy. They're at the heart of our local communities right across the country, and they employ millions of Australians. Not only do small businesses help put pay cheques in people's pockets; they contribute more than $430 billion to the nation's economy every single year.</span>

Right across Australia, including in the member for Fraser's home state, in my home state of Tasmania, and in New South Wales and Queensland, the recent floods have been devastating. As we sit here, some people are still bracing themselves to see what can be salvaged. Our thoughts are with them, and, of course, our support is with them. We've already announced individual relief for states, but we've also announced just recently relief for small businesses in my home state of Tasmania, and we are working with the New South Wales and Victorian governments to provide additional support that may be required for small businesses in those states as they come into the recovery phase.</span>

That's more than $10.9 million that will go to the NewAccess for Small Business Owners program and $4 million to continue the Small Business Debt Helpline.

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">s COLLINS:</span>  We've updated the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which mean that small businesses will get a bigger slice of the $70 billion in contracts that the Australian government spends every year, with a 20 per cent target for small business procurement. We've introduced legislation to make unfair contract terms illegal so that small businesses can negotiate fairer agreements with large partners. And, of course, these measures sit alongside the Albanese government's wider agenda that will benefit small businesses, including our increase to the skilled migration program to address skill shortages and our cheaper child care that will mean more parents will be able to do more hours and work in small businesses. We'll provide a one-off income credit to older Australians to give them the option to work and keep more of their money, immediately helping to boost the labour market supply, and we're accelerating the delivery of 465,000 additional fee-free TAFE places, with 180,000 to be delivered in 2023. We know that small businesses are vital to Australia, and we'll continue to support them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We are honouring our election commitment to provide $2.2 billion towards the early works of the Suburban Rail Loop East. Not only will that project actually benefit the suburbs of our great city of Melbourne; it will benefit Victorian regional communities as well. Let me tell you about that. Because the Victorian government are making Clayton a superhub, people who live in Gippsland will be able to get to Monash hospital, to the children's hospital and to Monash University, saving one hour in a round trip. So it is not just a project for the Victorian suburbs; it is a project for Victoria's regions as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, what we also know is that the detailed business and investment case for Suburban Rail Loop East, released by Victoria last year, demonstrated a cost-benefit ratio of 1.7, meaning that $1.70 would be returned for every single dollar invested. We know also that suburban rail will be assessed by Infrastructure Australia and that under the National Land Transport Act—which you guys seem to ignore but which actually exists—the project will also be subject to rigorous assessment processes between the Commonwealth and Victoria. We will respect those processes because that is what a responsible government does.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a transformational project for Victoria. We've seen over in Western Australia what METRONET has done, creating new suburbs, creating new community hubs and creating more affordable housing across the entirety of Perth. Suburban rail will transform the rail network in Victoria in the same way, not just for suburban Victorians but for people—including in your own electorate—</span>

I'm also pleased to report to the House that every single dollar of that investment goes to renewable energy and renewable energy transmission. We're investing in renewable energy zones in Victoria. We're investing in offshore wind in Victoria, which we will make a reality. We're investing in a better connection between Victoria and New South Wales, working in conjunction with both governments. And we're investing in Tasmania as well: a billion dollars of concessional finance to make Battery of the Nation a reality, and support for the north-west transmission link and, most important of all, the Marinus Link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Honourable members would know about the Marinus Link, because they've heard about it for six years. Like clockwork, every couple of months the previous government—the previous Prime Minister and the previous minister—would go to Tasmania and make an announcement of a couple of million dollars here and a couple of million dollars there. Last week, this Prime Minister announced $2½ billion of support to make this project a reality. What this project means is that Tasmania, which is already at 100 per cent renewable energy, will get to 200 per cent renewable energy and export that energy to the mainland, which is good for Tasmanians—creating jobs, unleashing investment, unleashing jobs—and will unleash cheaper renewable energy for all Australians on the national energy market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this project is so important. It's so important because there's no transition without transmission. We on this side of the House understand that. We understand that we are lucky, in Australia, to have a document called the Integrated System Plan, which outlines a road map for better transmission. The only problem with the Integrated System Plan is that there haven't been dollars attached to it; there hasn't been investment in it. We dealt with that in the then Leader of the Opposition's first budget reply as Leader of the Opposition, when he announced Rewiring the Nation to actually make that transmission a reality. But now we can only make it a reality because we are implementing that policy in government, and we continue to be in discussions with other state governments, right around the country, in relation to Rewiring the Nation, and that fund will be confirmed this evening in the budget. I look forward to further announcements with the Prime Minister, because we know that the world's climate emergency is Australia's jobs opportunity, with the right policies to seize those opportunities, and that's what we're going to continue to deliver. </span>

                  </a>  On Friday 14 October I was contacted by Josh Zimmerman, a journalist from the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper, in relation to a screenshot of a text message exchange purported to be attributed to me. The message contained the threat that I would quit the Liberal Party and sit on the crossbench. I can categorically deny it; the screenshot was a forgery and a fabrication. Impersonating a member of parliament with intent to cause false belief and detriment is a serious criminal offence. I wish to advise the House that I have reported the matter to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. The Australian Federal Police have provided me with a reference number for this matter: 7246165. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  In December 2018, the then Prime Minister announced that the Australian government would recognise West Jerusalem, the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, as the capital of Israel. The decision respected both a commitment to a two-state solution and longstanding respect for relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The government committed to moving the Australian embassy to West Jerusalem when practical, and in support of, and after the final status determination of, a two-state solution. In making this decision, Australia acknowledged the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a future state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The announcement followed a review by the secretaries of the departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence, and Home Affairs which included consultation with community representatives, former heads of relevant agencies and Australia's international allies and partners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United States recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December 2017, and its embassy was located in that city from May 2018. I confirm that the coalition maintains the principle of our position of recognising West Jerusalem and if elected would follow proper processes, including consultation with stakeholders, allies and partners. Our position has not changed. We remain a strong supporter of a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. Our recognition of West Jerusalem did not in any way pre-empt peace negotiations or undermine prospects of a peaceful settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Since 2020, five Arab nations have normalised relations with Israel, disproving arguments made in 2018 that the government's decision would make the conflict worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our relationship with Israel is enormously important. Australia is a great friend of Israel. Israel is our closest and most reliable partner in the Middle East, a region home to many threats, including threats to Australia. Other than the United States, Israel has no greater friend than Australia anywhere in the world, and the coalition will always be consistent about maintaining that friendship. Our friendship is as old as the State of Israel. We were the first country to vote in favour of the 1947 United Nations partition resolution adopted by the General Assembly, which led to Israel's establishment in 1948. Our contribution was noted by Israeli representative Abba Eban, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The manner in which you steered to a vote the second historic Resolution … the warmth and eloquence with which you welcomed Israel into the family of nations, have earned for you the undying gratitude of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are proud people-to-people links between Australia and Israel. Israel is a vigorous multiparty democracy, a beacon of freedom around the world. Our two nations have close economic, business and people-to-people connections. Our nations are united by shared values—a commitment to democracy, freedom and the rule of law. I particularly want to acknowledge the Jewish Australian community, over 100,000 strong, and the very significant contribution which has been made by that community to the prosperity and success of Australia. Of course, that community, along with others, has been heavily involved in the work of progressing technology partnerships with Israel and companies based in Israel, including on matters such as energy, water and finance technologies. It is a multidimensional relationship and a relationship that we on this side of the House are deeply committed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn from the position taken—and taken consistently—by this side of the House to the disastrous process followed by the Albanese Labor government. The process was executed with shocking timing. On 17 October, media reported that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website had removed references to the recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital and had removed references to the commitment to move the Australian embassy. A spokesperson for foreign minister Senator Wong was asked for clarification. That spokesperson said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The former Government made the decision to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. No decision to change that has been made by the current government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very next day, the foreign minister announced at a press conference that Australia would reverse the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Amazingly, this announcement occurred on the Jewish holiday of Simhath Torah and just two weeks before the Israeli election. Senator Wong was unable to point to how this abrupt reversal was in the national interest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it clearly was not. It was contemptuous of many important stakeholders. The Israeli ambassador and the Israeli government were not informed of the decision before it was announced by the Albanese Labor government. This is what Israel's Prime Minister Lapid had to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the way this decision was made … as a hasty response to an incorrect report in the media, we can only hope that the Australian government manages other matters more seriously and professionally</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Israeli government took the extraordinary step of summoning our ambassador to Israel to explain the Australian government's change in policy. The Albanese Labor government largely ignored speaking with Australians who care about a two-state solution that provides peace and security for Israel and a future Palestinian state, and instead informed them of the government's decision only after it was made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Executive Council of Australian Jewry said the decision was made in 'a shoddy manner', it was 'poor policy' and it was 'no way to treat an ally'. One member of this place said he was: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… disappointed by the decision … Capital cities are sovereign matters for sovereign states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who was that? That was the Labor member for Macnamara. He was disappointed by the decision. The former Labor member from this place Michael Danby described the government's decision as 'chaotic' and 'unprofessional'. And this House should not avoid noting that this decision was welcomed by two listed terrorist organisations in Australia: Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This would be bad enough if this government had taken this policy to the last election. But the truth is that this decision was never mentioned during the recent election campaign. Indeed, on the contrary, senior Labor members of parliament prior to the election assured concerned stakeholders, including readers of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Jewish News</span>, that on the question of Israel it didn't matter which way they voted. How wrong that proved to be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General wrote in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Jewish News</span> on 4 March this year attacking the member for Cook, the former Prime Minister, for suggesting that there was any difference in the policies of the two parties. What an appalling suggestion, apparently, except we had to wait only a few short months before this government confirmed there was, in fact, a stark difference in the policies of, on the one hand, the Liberal and National parties and, on the other hand, the Labor Party. The Attorney-General claimed that across domestic politics Australia 'spoke with one voice'. The member for Macnamara did likewise in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Jewish News</span> on 18 March, saying that Australia's Jewish community should feel proud that its interests would be safeguarded 'irrespective of whoever forms government'. I suggest that the Attorney-General and the member for Macnamara have a lot of explaining to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the wise words of Australia's former Ambassador to Israel and former member for Wentworth, who observed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Labor's policy provides a tailwind to extremists, and states such as Iran, who would like to see Israel wiped off the map and who insist that Israel has no rightful place in the region. Hezbollah will be cheering this Labor announcement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a disgraceful decision, disgracefully executed. Australia's Jewish community and many other right-thinking Australians have every reason to feel deeply disappointed and indeed abandoned by what this government has done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I rise to speak on this MPI more in sadness than in anger. Tonight, the Treasurer will begin the task of cleaning up the mess that the previous government left to us on the fiscal front. We'll be helping with cost-of-living pressures facing the Australian public and building a better future for our nation. I understand why those opposite don't want to talk about the budget in this MPI tonight and why they don't want to talk about the trillion dollars of Liberal debt that they leave this nation as a legacy, with very little economic dividend to show for it. I understand why they didn't ask any questions, extraordinarily, about the budget in question time today. It's disappointing that, instead of talking about the budget on budget day, those opposite have chosen to continue the Morrison government's legacy of putting short-term domestic politics ahead of the long-term national interest on foreign policy. Let me be very clear: the Albanese government does not and will not use sensitive foreign policy to play political games. It's not in the national interest, and the last election result shows that the Australian public are over it. They are sick of the politics of division. </span>

                  <a href="193430" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WATTS:</span>
                  </a>  We're not talking about a fringe view from the Labor Party here; we are talking about a considered position of like-minded nations and of all major Australian parties since 1948. Let's be very clear and reiterate that: it's the position of 70 years of successive Australian governments that there can be no lasting peace that does not address the status of Jerusalem, and the Albanese government will not undermine that approach. It was the position of the Gorton government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government, the Rudd government, the Gillard government, the Abbott government and the Turnbull government. Previous foreign minister Bishop said plainly, 'Matters relating to Jerusalem are subject to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.' Former prime minister Turnbull said about this decision:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The conclusion that I took, and my government took, after very careful and considered advice was that a policy that is well over 40 years old, 50 years old, should remain exactly the same as it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's position remained consistent for decades. It wasn't changed by the Gorton government following the Six-Day War in 1967, and all through the subsequent events it wasn't changed by Fraser, Hawke, Howard, Gillard, Turnbull or Rudd. The Liberal Party broke 70 years of bipartisan consensus and broke with international views to play short-term domestic political games in a by-election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only exception to the consensus has been former Prime Minister Morrison, who exploited the sensitivity of this issue for his own political purposes. On 15 October 2018, then prime minister Morrison dropped to the media that he was overturning decades of bipartisan policy on the Middle East by going ahead with his intention to move Australia's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He dropped this to the media on the same day he gave a heads-up to DFAT, and only one day after telling his then foreign minister, who he kept in the dark on this extraordinary foreign policy shift. This was a mere five days before the by-election in the seat of Wentworth took place. Then prime minister Morrison said he was persuaded by views put forward by his political candidate in Wentworth, Dave Sharma—leaving no doubt that this was a cynical attempt to get Mr Sharma elected. At the time of the vote, Penny Wong said, presciently: 'Floating a change in Liberal foreign policy just to try and hold onto the seat of Wentworth—does anyone believe he'll actually carry it through? This is posturing ahead of the by-election.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> John Roskam, the director of the IPA, a familiar figure in this chamber for those opposite, said at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If this week's announcement from the government truly was based on principle the test will come, not if the Liberals hold Wentworth tomorrow, but if they lose it. If the Liberals lose Wentworth and we never hear again about the embassy being moved, the PM will have succeeded in revealing that the Liberals' commitment to furthering democracy and freedom around the world is as skin deep as a byelection campaign promise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was remarkably prescient, because we all know what happened next—or, rather, what did not happen next. We know that then Prime Minister Morrison was only posturing with an announcement on this issue, because he didn't move the embassy, did he? After the by-election, just two months later, he announced that he was backing down and not moving the embassy. How cynical can you get? He didn't make the announcement out of conviction; it was just a political tactic, playing with the sensitive topic—the hopes and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was doubly cynical, because, before the speaker who just appeared in front of us today, the opposition would not confirm its position on this issue. This week, the opposition leader said that the coalition would make its announcement of their policy 'in the run-up to the next election'. Senator Birmingham, the spokesman on foreign affairs, said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, that proposition is at least a couple of years away until the next election. So, we think this is an unnecessary decision, the wrong decision to have made at this time. We would not have made this decision. Whether we will reconsider that position in the future is something, of course, that we would look closer to the next election cognisant of events as they unfold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the position that the first speaker in this debate just articulated. Their cynicism is only matched by their incompetence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Wong has reiterated, what occurred here was that the DFAT website was updated ahead of government processes. She took responsibility for resolving the situation and moved to clear up confusion as quickly as possible. She has expressed regret that the shift away from Australia's longstanding position and the shift back have been distressing for communities that have deep-rooted and keenly felt stakes in the cessation of conflict, particularly the Australian Jewish community. She has also said that the timing of the announcement, falling as it did on the high holidays, was also deeply regrettable. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that we can always do better on process. We're a grown-up government. We have acknowledged it. That is what adults do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and the future Palestinian state co-exist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. We share this position, that Jerusalem is a final status issue, with like-minded countries, such as France, Spain, South Korea, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, the European Union, Singapore, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Norway. Those opposite make like the position held by these countries is equated to a position held by a terrorist group. It's absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious times for Australia's international circumstances, and they call for serious political leadership. It's no secret that diplomacy was deprioritised and disregarded by the previous government. That has harmed our national interest. In contrast, the Albanese Labor government has hit the ground running, renewing Australia's closest relationships and advancing our interests and values overseas. We are in a race for influence and we're running that race internationally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're reversing nine wasted years of the Liberals and Nationals slashing Australia's development assistance, reducing our influence and leaving a vacuum for others to fill. We are working to make Australia a partner of choice for countries in our region to ensure our security and economic strength and to shape the world for the better. Tonight's budget will be a major step towards that goal of making Australia stronger and more influential in the world. We are building a stronger Pacific family, with a massive increase in support for development, infrastructure and security, including more than $147 million over four years for advancing Pacific security and engagement priorities; and expanding and improving Pacific labour mobility, to reinforce that we are part of the same Pacific family. Our assistance will help our regional partners to become more economically resilient, develop critical infrastructure and provide their own security so they have less need to call on others. Under the Albanese Labor government, Australia is now supporting our Pacific family more than ever before. The foreign minister has already visited 11 Pacific countries. The minister for the Pacific will visit every Pacific island country in this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also deepening our engagement with South-East Asia, with more support for economic development, an office for South-East Asia and developing a South-East Asia economic strategy. The foreign minister has shown this renewed commitment by visiting six South-East Asian countries already. We're strengthening key relationships, including the US alliance and the Quad. Just this weekend we strengthened our joint declaration on security cooperation with Japan. We're supporting the people of Ukraine, with the Prime Minister showing his personal support by visiting Ukraine, as well as being one of the biggest non-NATO contributors to the Ukrainians' defence of their homeland and advocacy for Ukraine around the world. We're restoring Australia's global climate leadership. As well as restoring Australia's reputation and rebuilding our relationships, we're cleaning up the failures of the Liberals' and Nationals' failures on our defence capability, which has left 28 projects running more than 97 years late. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that there are few issues more central to many Jewish people than the status of Jerusalem. As Senator Wong has said, it's more than a political issue. It's definitional: it's about history, faith and identity. It's the heart of Israel's origins and its future, and there can be no lasting peace that does not address its status. Its sensitivity is so deep for the overwhelming majority of the international community that it has always remained a final status issue that should be resolved as a part of any peace negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian people. It should not be the subject of political games. When Australia first recognised the State of Israel, Labor's then foreign minister, Doc Evatt, defined our objective as being to reach a just and fair solution. As Gideon Haigh noted in his biography of Doc Evatt:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No task so consumed Evatt's energies as the division of Palestine—which is remarkable for there being almost no incentive for him to do so … Populated by fewer than 40,000 Jews, Australia had no 'Jewish vote' to be courted, and the idea of a homeland enjoyed far from uniform support anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did it for national interest reasons.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  In the history of Australia it is hard to think of a more shambolic piece of foreign policy-making than Labor's position on Israel's capital. In the space of 24 hours they had three separate positions on it. Labor took a major foreign policy decision with no consultation, a decision that caused deep offence to a longstanding and significant friend and ally in the State of Israel. It was a decision that sends a bad message to all other countries with whom we have longstanding friendships and alliances. And, while it was rightly condemned by the only democracy in the Middle East, it was welcomed by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two organisations that we in Australia have listed as proscribed terrorist organisations. You know you're making bad public policy when the endorsement comes from listed criminal terrorist organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reversing the decision of the coalition government in 2018 to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was no small decision. It was a decision to ignore and disrespect the decision of a sovereign nation to choose its own capital. Labor's decision would be like another nation saying that they didn't recognise Canberra as our capital—that it should be Dubbo. Let's be clear: West Jerusalem is Israel's capital. Its parliament is there, its Supreme Court is there, the President lives there—it looks like the capital city of any other country. Yet Labor is lending credence to the fiction that it's not. This decision undermines Israel's status in a volatile region and it signals to those who oppose Israel that Australia's friendship actually depends on who's in government here, not on any deep-seated support for the shared values of democracy and the rule of law. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is a country whose intelligence helped us to foil major terrorist attacks on our own soil, and yet this bad decision gets the support of terrorists. When we have the Prime Minister of Israel condemning the decision and the Israeli foreign minister registering deep disappointment after not even having been consulted on this matter, we should all be concerned. Labor, in making this decision, has chosen to pander to the Left of its party and in the process has done lasting damage to a significant international relationship for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's perhaps most distressing in all of this is the way Labor has done all of this while speaking with a forked tongue. They've tried to convince Australians that there's no difference in foreign policy between Labor and the coalition when it comes to Israel, but that just isn't true. In March this year, in the lead-up to the election, the Attorney-General and the member for Macnamara were busy trying to reassure the Jewish community that Labor stands with Israel and there's no difference between its position and the coalition's position. Let me quote the Attorney-General. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has for generations spoken with one voice in support of Israel. Labor's own history of steadfast support for Israel extends back to well before the founding of the modern state in 1948.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took less than a year for Labor to demonstrate that this was untrue. I note that the Attorney-General has been remarkably silent on this matter over the past week, as compared to the member for Macnamara in his brave comments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's only expression of regret has been about how the politics of this issue have gone down. There's no serious willingness to listen to stakeholders and consider their views. There's no appetite for meaningful consultation, only a pseudoapology that this decision coincided with the Jewish festival of Simhath Torah, the 'joy of the law'. The timing was atrocious, but there's no good time to declare to an ally that you do not support their decision as a sovereign state. Labor haven't recognised the serious damage they've done to Australia's international reputation. And the way that the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that on budget day we should somehow ignore this particular issue, I think, underscores the fact that Labor are not taking this issue seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few matters plain regarding West Jerusalem, as the claims made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs are misleading and deserve a response. West Jerusalem is not the subject to final status negotiations. West Jerusalem is territory that has not been disputed and is not disputed. It has been part of Israel's sovereign territory since the state was established in 1948 and is not part of the territory which Israel captured during the 1967 war. It's outside the scope of UN resolutions since 1967, which are expressly limited to territory occupied by Israel since that time. While there's debate about Jerusalem, the status of West Jerusalem—which the coalition government made clear was the territory being recognised as the capital of Israel—is not under the same dispute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is a sovereign nation with a right to determine where its capital lies. If this government is going to mishandle major foreign policy matters and key international relationships, then Australians have good reason to be deeply concerned. We cannot afford to let the Labor Party play reckless games on foreign policy matters as significant as our relationship with one of our key allies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  May I start by reiterating the disappointment that the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed in having to speak to this MPI today. But I also stand to speak on this out of a sense of duty, if I may say so. The House has noted before, and I mentioned in my first speech, that I was born in Egypt—in 1967, on the cusp of the Six-Day War. It was just a few weeks before it, as a matter of fact. Throughout the Arab world, that war is known colloquially as an-Naksa, or the setback. After that war and through all the events since that war—and there have been many events in the Middle East—our position on this issue, which is at the heart of Middle East politics, has not changed. It wasn't changed by Malcolm Fraser. It wasn't changed by Bob Hawke. It wasn't changed by John Howard. It wasn't changed by Julia Gillard or Malcolm Turnbull. The assistant minister quoted the response of some of those former prime ministers as to why our position has not changed. I particularly want to point to former Prime Minister John Howard and a joint press conference with the PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who many will know was much loved for his dedication to the Palestinian cause. In that joint press conference with Yasser Arafat, he very clearly said, 'The status of Jerusalem is something that will be resolved by the parties in the discussion.' That sentiment has been echoed by various prime ministers since and in the words of former foreign minister Julie Bishop: 'Matters relating to Jerusalem are subject to final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand very well, perhaps more than most in this place, the sensitivities around this issue, the sensitivities among the Jewish Australian community, the Palestinian Australian community and Arab Australians more broadly. It hurts and is very disheartening to see that sensitive issues such as this are used to play political games. On this side, we have very clearly said that we do not and will not use sensitive issues to play political games. As a responsible international actor, we will not impose our views. We will, instead, encourage all parties to engage in negotiations towards a just and enduring two-state solution, as prime ministers and foreign ministers before us—since 1967, since I was born—have done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go through how it is that we have come to this situation. Through all the years that we have had a position on this that very clearly states that matters relating to Jerusalem are subject to final status negotiations there has been one exception, and that exception was from former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who exploited the sensitivity on this issue for political purposes. On 15 October 2018, Scott Morrison dropped to the media that he was overturning decades of bipartisan policy on the Middle East, including with his intention to move Australia's embassy from Tel Aviv, where it now is, to Jerusalem. He dropped this to the media on the same day he gave a heads-up to DFAT and only a day after telling his foreign minister. And all of this was five days before a by-election in the seat of Wentworth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are rightly cynical about our politics at times, and we are trying very hard to turn that around. But there is something particularly cynical, particularly distasteful, for the Australian people when their elected representatives seek to exploit such sensitive issues for their own gain. I think that's all that needs to be said about this issue. I will stop there but just to reiterate: this is decades-long bipartisan policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  The reason this matter is of such importance to the House today is not because the government has changed its mind. Governments are able to do that. The government of the day are elected and duly able to make decisions they believe are in the national interest, and that is not in discussion nor in debate. What is in debate is the manner and approach by which this government took this decision. That is what the debate is about today—the shambolic, dishonest and broken-promise approach that has been taken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally and passionately, I believe the State of Israel has the right to exist in peace within secure borders, with Jerusalem as its indivisible, eternal capital. That is my view. The previous government took the view, as given by then Prime Minister Morrison on 18 December in a speech to the Sydney Institute, that Australia would recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. West Jerusalem is not in contention, having been part of the State of Israel since its foundation. Mr Morrison, the member for Cook, said the announcement followed a review by the secretaries of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence and Home Affairs, which included consultation with community representatives, former heads of relevant agencies, and Australia's international allies and partners. That is who was consulted in the government making a lawful decision. The starting points for the review were our commitment to a two-state solution and meeting all of our obligations under international law. The review team's recommendations were considered by the National Security Committee of cabinet, and the NSC's decision was confirmed by cabinet. On 18 December, Australia briefed allies and nations on the decision. Subsequently, in March 2019, Australia opened a new Australian Trade and Defence Office in West Jerusalem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the process the former government took to making a major foreign policy decision—as all governments are entitled to do—which begs the question: what process did this government embark on to make a decision? I am not, and this parliament is not, criticising the capacity to make a decision. We're not questioning whether the government have the right to make it. They are the elected government of the day. But the process and the shambolic approach to how it was made is extraordinary, notwithstanding that I think the decision is poor on so many levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we step through how the decision was made, the shambolic nature of it and the contrived sop to the Left become self-evident. Prior to the election, senior Labor members of parliament assured concerned stakeholders that there was no difference in position between the government and the opposition. Indeed, the member for Isaacs, the Attorney-General, on 6 March said that across domestic politics Australia 'spoke with one voice'. The member for Macnamara on 18 March said Australia's Jewish community should feel proud that its interest would be safeguarded, 'irrespective of who forms government'. Then, on 17 October, there were media reports that the Department of Foreign Affairs website had removed references to the recognition of West Jerusalem, and we had the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs coming in and saying it was an administrative error. It'd be one of the first I've seen DFAT to make publicly, but let's run with 'administrative error', shall we? On 17 October a spokesperson for the foreign minister told media:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The former Government made a decision to recognise West Jerusalem … No decision to change that has been made by the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Really? So the Department of Foreign Affairs, of its own volition, decided, on one of the more contentious issues, that it would change the website prior to the foreign minister saying no decision had been made? And those opposite expect the Australian people to believe that rubbish? It's absolute and utter nonsense!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders, including the Australian Jewish community and Israel's Ambassador to Australia, were also assured on the same day—apparently when DFAT was on a frolic—that there would be no change. Then, in less than 24 hours, on 18 October, the foreign minister announced at a press conference that Australia would reverse the decision. The announcement occurred just prior to the budget, on a Jewish holiday, just two weeks out from a heavily contested Israeli election. There was no consultation with communities and no consultation with allies and partners. The Israeli Ambassador to Australia and Israel's government found out about the announcement from the media. That is what this discussion is about—the shambolic, appalling and pathetic nature of the way in which this decision was made.</span>

It certainly was, and it was made cynically for domestic political purposes. That's the only way the Australian public can possibly read the decision that was taken by the former government. It's the only way they can read it, because—unlike many of the members here today who will be speaking on this, and the very raucous members during question time when, on budget day, this was the first question asked—many Australians are students of history. When it comes to the two-state solution and to the creation of the State of Israel, many Australians understand the history because they have lived it. Australians understand that, when it came to that vote at the United Nations, Australia was the first country to vote yes for the creation of the State of Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians understand that the question of Jerusalem has been respected as something that will be determined as a status issue, because it is the most contentious thing and could have gotten in the way of peace talks and finding a workable two-state solution. So everybody has respected that over decades. People on that side and people on this side, whether in government or in opposition, have respected that that was what common sense asked for, not just in this country but around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then along came Prime Minister Morrison, who decided to throw that out the window and make a shambolic, contentious decision five days out from a by-election, on the advice of the candidate running in that by-election for the Liberal Party—absolute cynicism. I welcome the fact that today we are here so that we can put back on the record Australia's support for a two-state solution and for the fact that the question of Jerusalem is a status issue that will be dealt with by the parties involved. This will put us back in line with most other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be surprised that former Prime Minister Morrison made this shambolic, contentious decision. After all, he's also the first Australian Prime Minister to give himself five portfolios. There were things that that Prime Minister did that appeared to the Australian public to be on a whim, to not be thought through and to not be considered in terms of the ramifications—only short-termism. There was no thought given to what would happen with the change of government, even though Labor's stated position was clear. There was no thought given to what that would mean—just short-term politics, trying to get a short-term edge in a by-election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our foreign policy. Decades of Australian foreign ministers and prime ministers have agreed on this position. But we shouldn't be surprised, because the previous government did several things in foreign affairs across nine years that were of concern to Australians, including Australians travelling overseas, who notice these things. I noticed them myself in visiting countries in Asia. There were no signs about Australian aid anywhere—all gone, whereas, 10 years previously, Australian aid had been front and centre in our region. We were respected. We were seen as helpful. This government is committed to ensuring that a sensible foreign minister, a sensible prime minister and a sensible government will put Australia back into the right places in foreign affairs and regain the respect that we held for decades internationally, not just on this issue but on many others. It was shambolic and contentious, and Labor will not make shambolic and contentious decisions like the former Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</span>

To those who are listening to the broadcast and those who have the privilege of sitting in the gallery: one should not make the assumption that this side of the chamber is pro-Egypt and the other side is pro-Palestine. That is not the case, and that is not what we are debating here today. There are good people that sit on either side of the chamber, and there is a healthy respect in this parliament for both cases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is it a sensitive issue; it is a complicated issue. It is a complicated issue. To try to better my knowledge, some three or four weeks ago I travelled to Israel, sponsored by AIJAC—to better understand. Since returning, I have met and spoken at length with those on the other side of the chamber to better understand the Palestinian perspective, because the view that was put to us was through a particular prism. What we hear today in this MPI debate is the government's ill-judgement and mishandling of the decision to reverse the capital state. Out of interest, I googled what the capital of Israel was, and it came up with 'Jerusalem'. It didn't preface it with 'west'. It just came up as 'Jerusalem'. But the moral of that story is that you may not believe everything that's on Google. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, when Labor suggested to the Australian public that they had a plan and it was a very good plan—none of us know what the plan is at the moment—I don't remember a broad outline of a plan in the foreign policy space about shifting the capital. I just don't recall that. So it is fair enough that, on behalf of my 1,000-strong Jewish community, I get to my feet and call out what I see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what's also salient is that while I was in Tel Aviv—some interesting, fun facts. Tel Aviv recently just passed New York, London and Rome as the most expensive city in the world, showing the advancement of Tel Aviv. We spent a considerable amount of time in Jerusalem. As a part-practising Catholic I found the historical content there overwhelming—from an archaeological perspective, from a religious perspective, through the prism of Christianity. Your guidebook around Jerusalem is a Bible. Your guide says to you: 'That's where Jesus was betrayed by Judas. That is the place where he was marched off. That's where he was incarcerated.' It was very moving, through the prism of Catholicism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that it wasn't seen to be just a Jewish trip, we had the opportunity to meet with the Palestinian Prime Minister. Interestingly, while we were waiting at a cafe, we had the opportunity to catch up with some Palestinian youths. We were suited up, and they said—through our interpreter, clearly—'What are you doing here?' We said, 'We're meeting with your Prime Minister.' They were three well-dressed kids, 15-year-olds with their mobile phones. My first question was: 'Why aren't you in school?' They said: 'You're meeting with our Prime Minister. Could you deliver a message from us?' We said, 'What's the message you want us to deliver on your behalf?' They said: 'If you're meeting with our Prime Minister, I'll give you something, and you deliver it to him. But don't open it—only the Prime Minister.' I said, 'I don't think the level of security is going to allow that to happen.' There was a high level of disdain from the youths, and what they planned to do was something untoward—because in the daytime they like to get on a bus and go down to the border, and they go and work construction. I was in awe of the way that they kept themselves—well dressed, well groomed. Palestine is a country that's looking to advance itself. Israel is a country that needs to be supported.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I'll begin my remarks by talking about my grandfather, who was in Israel at its early inception in 1948 and then lived on a kibbutz with my grandmother in the 1950s. They were one of the first generations of people who were trying to turn a barren desert into a country. My grandfather was an extremely good man and he was a kind man, and he told me a story about his time in the 1950s in Israel. It was a story of an unfortunate conflict that happened between him and his Arab neighbours, and he was shattered by it. He didn't want to raise my father in an area where there was going to be this ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and he said he made the hardest decision of his life: to leave Israel and to find a new place to live. And, even though he lived his life in Australia—and he was a proud Labor man and he was really proud that I was, at the time, working for the Labor Party—he was always sad that he couldn't make his life in Israel. It was a huge part of who he was. He'd just watched the Holocaust happen in World War II, and he was shattered by the state of the Jewish world. It is just one example of one family that is deeply connected to its own identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand the Middle East is to understand individuals; it's to understand their spirituality; it's to understand their connection to a land that literally formed the three Abrahamic faiths that have dominated our civilisation for the last 2,000 years. To understand the Middle East and to talk about the Middle East, you have to do it delicately and respectfully, and you have to do it, I believe, in a way that aims to seek peace and aims to seek a cooperation and a future where people come together. And it is my dream to see peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. There are very few things I want to see more in my lifetime—other than to see my daughter grow up to be happy and healthy—than peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It is one of the great bits of unfinished business of our species, of humankind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I regularly meet with Palestinian advocates here in Australia, and I will continue to do so. We don't always agree on everything, but we have honest conversations, and I value them and the fact that they stand up, and we hope to see a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of Jerusalem: it is a deeply contentious issue. The former government started a process before a by-election, and didn't end up moving an embassy, and promised to recognise West Jerusalem. It doesn't actually encapsulate the old city of Jerusalem—the famous old city where you've got the Armenian, the Islamic, the Jewish, and the Christian quarters and the part of Israel that is so deeply rooted in the holiness of all of the different faiths; that's actually in East Jerusalem. And if you were to ask an Israeli whether that's part of Israel or not, it would be inconceivable for an Israeli to say that that's not a part of their capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the fact that those opposite are coming at us for reversing their decision. But, actually, the policy that they proposed was not welcomed in Israel. It was a deeply contentious one that removed a deeply spiritual part of Israeli identity. And I don't say that to be holier than thou at this point in time—on the contrary: I think we need to be humble when talking about these issues. I say it to say that the Middle East is complex and, when coming to these debates, we must tread carefully and lightly, for our role, as Australians, in this region is to play a constructive role in order to achieve peace. That is our role. And to promise matters that you don't deliver on, four days before a by-election, is not the way—nor was it, to be honest, to deliver a policy on Simhath Torah. That was a mistake, I believe, that we needed to own, and we did own, and I apologise again to the people in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to explain how people in Macnamara would be feeling, but I'll try to, just very briefly. For those people, to understand Jerusalem as the capital is as simple as us understanding Canberra as the capital of our country, and it would be like someone telling us that Surfers Paradise was the capital instead of Canberra—something that doesn't really make sense. I know that this is a final status issue, and I don't say this to demean the positions of those on the other side of this contentious debate; I'm just trying to give a perspective on what people are experiencing in my electorate and how difficult this would be for them to digest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I come to this debate and say that I hope we have better days ahead. I hope deeply that we find, in my lifetime, a resolution to this long and protracted conflict and we see peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  Can I just begin by acknowledging the member for Macnamara. That was a very moving and heartfelt address. Before I came into this place, you and I met at an event for a Jewish school, and you said something to me that I've never forgotten: 'When you come into this place, never forget what that feeling is like. You never know how long it will last. And use every day to make a contribution'. You've just made an excellent contribution. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't claim to know this issue as well as you do, or as well as many other people do, but I often think of a perspective that I can understand a bit better. I was born in Dublin, in Ireland. When we came to Australia in 1988, I would often hear, in the following years, people give ill-informed comments on the status of Northern Ireland, about whether a unified Ireland should happen or whether it should always be part of England. Like this issue, it's complex and it's difficult. But, as a kid, growing up, I had the same dream, that Catholic and Protestant kids could go to school together, could work together, could marry and live. It just didn't make any sense to me that people who looked like family were at war with each other. I never understood that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe there are some parallels here. I've come in as a new member, straight into opposition. I'm happy to be here, but I know that most of my colleagues would like—and I would too—to be where you are one day, and we've got to earn that right. When I go to schools, or speak to people in the electorate, and they ask, 'What is it like?' one of the things I say is that it's been quite pleasant working with people from the other side in committees and in some of the training that we do. And, when it comes to defence and foreign affairs, I sing your praises. I'd like to think, almost all of the time, the new government has done a pretty good job on defence and foreign affairs—not perfect, and we will keep a close watch—but I think this was a mistake. It was a mistake in how it was handled. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to stand here and say, 'I have the answers on the status of Israel's capital,' but I think the point that a sovereign nation can decide its capital is a seductive one. It makes sense; it just does. Was the timing of the announcement, on a by-election, a good thing? Probably not. It probably wasn't. But that doesn't justify this timing. That doesn't justify another mistake, and it could have been handled better. I had a note here about the Jewish holiday, and I saw, when someone else read it out, that you corrected them, so tell me if this is correct: Simhath Torah. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say this: Australia must remain a strong supporter of a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state can coexist. We on this side support Australia continuing to call for all parties to the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel to maintain restraint and to renounce violence. Violence never achieves anything. Labor has made a mistake here. It does need to act more professionally on major foreign policy decisions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I watched when the criticism came thick and fast about our relationship with France, in relation to AUKUS. That was unfair. With a decision as tightly held as that, of course there was no other way to do it than the way that it occurred. But there was no allowance for that in most of the commentary that I saw from the other side. If you are sitting over here one day and we're there, if we are doing a good job on defence and foreign affairs, feel free to say so. You're welcome to do it. As long as I am in this place, I won't criticise you for putting the national interest first, because that's why I am here. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this decision has not come without a cost. It's not a domestic political cost that we're seeking to get an advantage from; it's a cost to the nation. Let's look at the response from the Israeli Prime Minister: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the way this decision was made … as a hasty response to an incorrect report in the media, we can only hope that the Australian government manages other matters more seriously and professionally</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then Australia's Ambassador to Israel was summoned by the Israeli foreign minister, who registered his deep disappointment in the face of the Australian government's decision resulting from short-sighted political considerations. We could have handled the announcement better, but so could you. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  Notwithstanding the last speaker, the previous speakers in the opposition have not been able to acknowledge, or won't admit to, three things about this MPI. No. 1: they won't acknowledge that the government's policy is actually a reaffirmation of the longstanding bipartisan policy of successive Australian governments that has been in existence for decades. No. 2: they won't acknowledge that it was actually they, the opposition, when they were in government under Scott Morrison, that, in 2018, decided to do foreign policy on the run, breaking and breaching decades of bipartisanship, and for what? For a pathetic attempt at short-term political gain. And No. 3—and this is a general point: as you've seen in the first couple of months of government, our foreign policy is based on a sensible approach to the national interest, not a personal political interest, not a short-term political gain in a by-election. In this case, our foreign policy is in alignment with the international community's broad agreement that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved as part of any peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. Let's be very clear: the position of successive Australian governments has been that there can be no lasting peace that does not address that final status of Jerusalem, and, as the Prime Minister said earlier today, he will not and his government will not undermine that approach.</span>

I'll talk about how, even more recently, your former Prime Minister John Howard said himself in a joint press conference that the status of Jerusalem is something that would be resolved by the parties in discussion.

It wasn't changed by John Howard, Julia Gillard or Malcolm Turnbull—or Tony Abbott for that matter. But it was changed by Scott Morrison, the exception amongst all those prime ministers. He decided, 'Oh, I'll exploit the sensitivity of this issue for a short-term political purpose,' when he decided to drop in the media during the by-election for Wentworth that he was going to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and he was trying to do this, of course, so that he could win the by-election in Wentworth for Dave Sharma. Scott Morrison said at the time he was persuaded by the arguments of Dave Sharma, leaving no doubt in all of our minds that this was simply a cynical attempt to get Dave Sharma re-elected in Wentworth. It didn't work. They lost the by-election. The voters of Wentworth saw right through that political stunt, and they lost the by-election.</span>

When you ask the opposition leader, he says, 'Oh, we'll make that decision or announce that policy in the run-up to the next election.' It's all political games with this mob, but this is too important to play those games. Our national interest, the region's interest, the world's interest must focus on making a substantive effort to reach peace through negotiations between the parties, and Australia can play that role under an Albanese Labor government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights fifth scrutiny report for 2022, which was tabled out of session last week. I note a substantial amount of work went into this report by the legal advisers and by the committee secretariat, and I want to acknowledge the expertise and hard work of the human rights committee staff. They are incredible public servants. I know I speak on behalf of all members of the committee when I say that we were extremely impressed by how much work they produced and how much effort they put in, which allowed us to have detailed and important considerations of parliamentary bills, especially the National Anti-Corruption Commission Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in the National Anti-Corruption Commission Bill and the National Anti-Corruption Commission (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill engage a number of rights, particularly the right to privacy and reputation, a fair trial and freedom of expression. I am pleased to note these bills are accompanied by a lengthy and detailed statement of compatibility with human rights. The committee thanks the Attorney-General for his comprehensive and well-reasoned statement of compatibility, which has greatly assisted the committee in undertaking its scrutiny role. I am reliably told that this statement of compatibility was one of the best ever. Well done, Attorney-General. The committee considers that, in general, excepting those issues which were specifically discussed in the report, the limitations on human rights in the bills have been adequately explained in the statement of compatibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee does, however, make seven recommendations to amend some specific provisions and to include more information in the statement of compatibility. These recommendations will not alter the objectives the bills seek to achieve; rather, they will strengthen safeguards which have already been included, thereby improving their capability and compatibility with human rights. They will also ensure that the least rights restrictive approach to achieving those objectives is taken. The final recommendation is that a foundational human rights assessment of several pieces of existing covert surveillance legislation be undertaken so that this committee can fully assess the human rights implications of conferring these complex powers on the proposed commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members know, these bills have been referred to the Joint Select Committee on National Anti-Corruption Commission Legislation for inquiry and report by 10 November. For this reason, it is not possible for the committee in the time frame available to seek a response from the Attorney-General in relation to the matters it has raised. Rather, the committee offered recommendations to improve the human rights compatibility of specific provisions in order that these recommendations be made available to the Attorney-General, the select committee and the parliament for consideration. I encourage all members to closely examine those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I can advise the House that last week the committee met with the delegation of the United Nations subcommittee on prevention of torture, who were visiting Australia. Their role was to assess how authorities have implemented their obligations under the optional protocol to the convention against torture. A little has been made out about the visit to Australia, including some of the restrictions faced in some of the states, but I want to assure the House that the human rights committee happily met with the subcommittee on their trip. We had a robust and respectful conversation, and I thank all committee members for their participation in that. With these comments, I commend committee scrutiny report 5 of 2022 to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O</span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">'</span>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">BRIEN</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I'm delighted to stand today to speak on the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Legislation Amendment Bill 2022. This legislation builds on the legal framework established by the coalition. Offshore energy infrastructure has the potential to create significant investment and job creation opportunities, as well as to contribute to Australia's future energy security. That is why, when in government, the coalition delivered on a 2019 election commitment and passed legislation to enable the development of offshore electricity infrastructure and provide industry with the certainty it needed to invest in Australian offshore electricity infrastructure projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021 established a regulatory framework that covers all phases of development, from construction through to decommission, of generation and transmission projects. These bills were designed to help the implementation of critical underwater transmission projects, such as Marinus Link, the proposed 1,500-megawatt transmission line between Tasmania and Victoria. Marinus Link will unlock new investment in generation projects, including pumped hydro energy storage. It will help deliver a more reliable, affordable energy system, helping keep the lights on and helping prices go lower. The framework that we established also supported development of generation projects, including Star of the South, a proposed offshore wind project already under initial development off the coast of Gippsland, Victoria. There are at least 10 other offshore generation projects that have been proposed around Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Bill 2021 provided a robust mechanism for granting licences to allow the development of offshore electricity projects in Commonwealth waters while providing protections for the safety of workers and strong protection of other maritime stakeholders. This was part of the decisive action that we took to deliver affordable, reliable energy for Australians. Households and businesses rely on affordable, reliable power to grow and to thrive. We saw the results under the coalition. Electricity prices under the coalition fell for households by 10 per cent; for small businesses 10 per cent; for industry 12 per cent. As an extension of the coalition's work, this bill that we have before us today is a reminder of our proud legacy as a coalition in this area. Australia was deploying new renewable capacity, particularly solar, faster than almost any other major economy in the world under the coalition. More than $40 billion had been invested in renewable energy since 2017. Record uptake of renewables over the last five years was seen under the coalition government. In 2021 Australia installed 6.1 gigawatts of renewable capacity, more than what was installed under the entirety of the previous Labor government from 2007 to 2013. Nearly one in three homes had installed solar on their roofs—the world's highest rate of uptake. Through ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation alone we invested over $11 billion in more than 800 clean energy projects with a total value exceeding $39 billion. That indeed is a legacy to be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of this bill that is before the House today has the coalition's support. I note that the government makes a number of minor amendments to the act. While the amendments are mostly non-controversial and the coalition supports the ongoing development of Australia's offshore wind industry, a notable amendment with which I have a problem is that the minister, rather than the regulator, will be given the powers to decide what forms and amounts of financial security licence holders must provide and when these obligations must cease under regulations. The coalition believes this proposed amendment, that allows the minister rather than the regulator to decide matters relating to the financial security of licence holders, risks emboldening the government's plan to accelerate the rollout of renewable projects without sufficient community consultation—that is, without a social licence—and risks easier terms for licence holders than an independent authority might otherwise approve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewables will play a vitally important role in the future of our energy mix. We need to give renewables every chance of success. But the problem with the government's approach is that it is setting up renewables for failure and not success. They are doing this by putting pressure on renewables that defies economics and engineering. This will come at a cost and a high risk, a cost that will ultimately be paid and a risk ultimately borne by Australians, Australian consumers and Australian businesses. I, therefore, move a second reading amendment, which has been circulated in my name:</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Labor government fails to understand is that the objective is to decarbonise the Australian economy and not to decapitate the Australian economy. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy boasts that the pathway he is leading the country down with respect to energy will be as transformative as the Industrial Revolution. If that is so, it goes to his irresponsibility that he would legislate for such a pathway without having his own department or Treasury do any economic modelling of the impact of his plan. The pathway that Labor is venturing down will fail. It will be a train wreck. There is a missionary zeal on the part of the minister, for which only Australian businesses and households will pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me address some of the points raised in my amendment, and I will do so, time permitting, one by one. First is the broken promise of a $275 reduction in household power bills. Before the election, Labor promised Australian households they would reduce power bills by $275. This was not a once-off slip of the tongue—Labor made this core to their entire campaign, repeating that promise on 97 occasions. Fewer than six months have gone by since Labor were in power and they have left this promise—they have broken it and they are crab walking away. Not one sitting of parliament has taken place without either the Prime Minister, the minister or both refusing to answer a direct question with a direct answer on whether or not they will honour their promise to the Australian people of a $275 drop in household power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from CEOs of the energy sector recently, making it very clear that prices haven't just gone up but will continue to go up. We had one CEO suggesting that prices will increase by another 35 per cent next year. Power bills have already gone up under Labor, and now they're going to go up another 35 per cent. But the Australian Energy Regulator has subsequently come out and told us that, no, prices by their account will go up by 50 per cent next year. That could be as much as $1,245 for an Australian household. Think about that: Australian households who were promised $275 coming off their electricity bills, and already facing skyrocketing prices, are now being told that under Labor's plan prices might go up over $1,200 just over the next 12 months. This is the extent of the duplicity of the Labor Party. This is the government that promised the Australian people one thing and have refused to confirm that they will honour that commitment ever since coming to office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point in the amendment is the increasing unreliability of the National Electricity Market, or NEM. I recall the energy minister assuring Australians in June that the grid was reliable and there was no risk of blackouts. Then, literally within days, the market operator took unprecedented intervention in the NEM. Why? For fear of blackouts. Already—so quickly—we saw a minister who was not across his brief and clearly did not understand the instability in the grid that their policies are driving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Market Operator, AEMO, warned in their most recent <span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ectricity </span><span style="font-style:italic;">statement of opportunities</span>, which came out in August, that we are going to see growing reliability gaps in 2023. Really, what they are saying is: they've made it bad and they're going to make it a lot worse. Alinta's CEO, Jeff Dimery, said, 'I think we're headed for failure unless things change significantly.' Energy Australia's CEO, Mark Collette, said, 'I am more concerned about a smooth energy transition than a year ago.' Australian industry cannot afford instability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me to the third point in the amendment, and that is the impact of skyrocketing prices and a wobbling grid on Australian households and businesses. I'm sure I'm not the only member in this chamber who has spoken to senior citizens who struggled through winter and who are now very pleased that we're in this spring season and heading through to summer. In winter, there were seniors across our communities who at night were having to make the tough choice between eating dinner or turning on their heating, because prices were going up and they couldn't afford both. Like other colleagues in this chamber, I'm sure, I have spoken to families who are making really hard choices as the cost of living keeps going up. I've been talking to people who have genuinely said to me, 'I voted Labor because I thought the cost of living was going to be improved.' These are families who are doing it tough. Families who were promised that $275 would come off their power bills are now seeing their power bills skyrocket and are being told they're going to increase by another 50 per cent. This is the real impact on families and on seniors who are doing it tough across our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you have the impact on businesses. Now, I've certainly been on the shop floor over the last few months. I've spoken to foundry workers and to steelmakers who are basically saying that, because of the increased cost of energy, shutting up shop is a real option. The Australian Workers Union, the AWU themselves, have already sent a warning that 800,000 manufacturing jobs in Australia are at risk because of these power prices—800,000 manufacturing jobs! That's not me. That's not the Liberal-National coalition. That's the Australian Workers' Union. Why? Because energy prices are skyrocketing, and this government does not have a plan to tackle that. They have a promise, but they won't honour that promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The extraordinary irony here is that the minister is very quick to his feet to justify these bizarre energy policies, which the energy sector itself knows are setting up industry for failure, on the basis of climate change. When these energy-intensive businesses, our major remaining foundries and steelmakers, close in Australia, what operations will pick up the slack and fill the void? They will be operations in countries, like India and China, that are far higher emitters—and why wouldn't they? How does that reduce emissions for the planet? How is that good for climate change?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That takes me to the fourth point in my amendment, which notes the policy failures that are accelerating the closure of baseload power and restricting dispatchability. Here we have the problem of Labor's unplanned and disorderly acceleration of renewable rollouts, along with transmission lines. If you look at recent announcements by AGL, Origin Energy, the Queensland government, the Victorian government, these will result in more than 20 gigawatts of coal fired generating capacity being shut down by 2035. That is well over three-quarters of our baseload capacity. The problem is this: as the government supports and welcomes these announcements, they know there is no guarantee of a replacement in time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This represents an enormous problem. If we are talking about over three-quarters of baseload capacity being ripped out of the system by 2035 without any guarantee of a replacement, what does that mean to not just prices but industry—keeping the lights on? People like to compare Australia to Germany, saying we are following a German model of a great, hasty rush to renewables and the closure of baseload power and we are setting ourselves up for danger. But don't offend Germany in that! Because we are seeing recently that Germany are turning back on their baseload power stations. They had the common sense to mothball their power stations so that if a crisis hit they could turn them back on. That is their plan B. In Australia much of the fleet that we're closing are not being mothballed. They are being entirely demolished—gone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that we are a vast island. We're not landlocked. We don't have extension cords importing electricity from other nations, like they do in Europe. In other words, if Labor's plan A fails—and it will fail—there is no plan B, none whatsoever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth point in my amendment was concern that regional communities feel that they might be steamrolled. This is an important one, because in a listening tour that I have done over recent months across regional Australia, I have to say that Australians are in no way against renewables. They don't have an aversion to renewables. That's not the issue at all. I think most Australians, like the coalition, believe renewables have a really important role to play. But where they are concerned is that they are seeing a missionary zeal on the part of the minister and this government to roll out renewables at a scale and a speed which puts a big question mark over social licence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Communities in regional Australia rightly feel that the Labor Party is so hellbent on rolling out so many renewables and transmission lines in such a short period of time that their communities will be rolled over. Think of the extent of Labor's plan, which again is 40 wind turbines per month, over 22,000 solar panels every day, all the way up to 2030. Think about that—all the way up to 2030. Plus 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines. Is it any wonder regional communities are worried? Can you imagine if you were in regional Australia today, concerned about this, that you might have a carpeting across your community and you listen to question time, where the opposition put genuine questions to the government and could not get one straight answer? Why? Because the government hasn't planned for it. Is it any wonder this is going to be a train wreck in Australia because this government has not planned for its transition. That is why regional Australia, along with, especially, those from the energy sector, are so deeply concerned about where this government is taking this agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, we need an appropriate set of environmental considerations. We have to be mindful that, as much as renewables have an important role to play, they, like every technology, have weaknesses. We know some of their weaknesses when it comes to their lack of dispatch ability, which is why they need gas to support them. They need complementary technologies, gas just being part of the equation. But we also have to recognise that there are other environmental weaknesses of renewables, especially when it comes to wind farms: it is birdlife and it is sea life, and these need to be prioritised in any assessment of offshore wind farms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventh is the importance of product stewardship, and this is important because I have heard some extraordinary stories going across Australia about renewable products being dumped. If you think about the toxicity of solar panels and of batteries, the vast majority are going to landfill. There is no plan whatsoever. There is no solution to managing waste. Product stewardship, therefore, has to be a core element in any such legislation that we are dealing with today, especially if we are looking at literally over 22,000 solar panels every single day with a very short lifespan compared to baseload plants. That waste management must be put as a priority of the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighth is the importance of maximising local procurement. These projects must provide an economic boost to communities. We are very cognisant of the fact that much of the content for offshore wind farms will be coming from overseas, but where we have regional areas impacted most by these projects they are also the areas that must benefit most from procurement opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninth is the importance of transparency around financial security for deals approved by the minister. As noted earlier, one of the amendments that the Labor government is seeking to arrange here is for the minister, not the regulator, to make decisions with respect to financial security. If a licence holder has to agree to a certain amount of security to cover activities such as decommission—how that is done, whether it be a banknote, whether it be a letter of credit, how long those obligations need to last—and if the minister ends up being responsible for such decisions, then transparency becomes absolutely key. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tenth is the failure of the minister to appreciate the importance of attaining a social licence. There is no more important prerequisite for major energy projects that impact local communities than a social licence. This comes to the heart of where I believe the Labor Party is going wrong with the pathway they have chosen to decarbonise the Australian economy, a pathway that will ultimately decapitate the Australian economy. Despite what they told the Australian people, power prices are skyrocketing under this Labor government. The electricity grid is wobbling and becoming unreliable. Local communities are fearful at the pace of accelerated rollouts of 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines, 22,000 solar panels every day and 40 wind turbines a month. They are worried. Once the Australian people see their way of life threatened and see the nation's energy security threatened, they will have had enough, and they will say, 'Enough.' It is at that time that we will see that the Labor government has basically broken the unwritten compact with the Australian people on climate change and energy. </span>

The Emergency Response Fund's enabling legislation passed the parliament in October 2019. That $4 billion Emergency Response Fund allows the Commonwealth to draw on as much as $200 billion in any given year, in addition to what is already available to fund emergency response and natural disaster recovery and preparedness, when it determines that the existing recovery and resilience-building programs are insufficient to provide an appropriate response to natural disasters. The type of assistance that could be provided under the Emergency Response Fund included recovery project grants, service provision, adoption of technology helping recovery, and resilience or economic aid packages for affected communities or industry sectors to help build their resilience to future natural disasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This month we have seen why having a perpetual source of funds to support preparedness and recovery from natural disasters is so important. Thousands have been impacted by the floods in New South Wales and Victoria. Homes have been flooded, belongings destroyed. These are terrible events, and we extend our sympathies to the communities affected. We also extend our admiration to the members and volunteers of the emergency response agencies that are assisting those affected. The former coalition government ensured that the Emergency Response Fund made contributions to disaster recovery and disaster preparedness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government committed $50 million for the Coastal and Estuarine Risk Mitigation Program. The program will help drive long-term resilience and sustainability by delivering priority projects that mitigate the impact of disasters on communities and economies by targeting high-priority locally and nationally significant coastal and estuarine disaster risk mitigation projects. The former coalition government also committed $150 million to fund recovery and postdisaster resilience measures in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. The opposition notes that the bill confirms that these commitments and disbursements will be honoured. We acknowledge the government's support for those disbursements by grandfathering them into legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today makes two substantive policy changes to the Emergency Response Fund: (1) it removes the fund's ability to make payments for the purpose of disaster recovery, so the entire $200 million per annum disbursement amount must be spent on activities that prepare for or reduce the risk of future natural disasters; and (2) it allows the responsible ministers to adjust the maximum disbursement amount by a disallowable legislative instrument. While the opposition will be supporting this bill today, we are concerned about the responsible minister's power to increase the maximum disbursement amount by instrument, pushing aside the legislated cap. It is not clear what implications this might have for the fund's perpetuity if this power is not prudently exercised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that the bill is being considered by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, which is due to report by 16 November. We will await the report and findings from that inquiry and consider any recommendations it makes. I move:</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I will make a very short tabling statement. We are required by legislation to table an annual report. It's a fascinating read, of course, which I won't regale the House with on this occasion. There are the normal suite of inquiries, you might say, in terms of Auditor-General's reports, examination of the Parliamentary Budget Office and so on. The only one that I'd draw the House's attention to in particular is the 10-year review of the Auditor-General Act 1997. Overall, that review found that the act is working well and made 27 recommendations of varying import for change. I'd like to acknowledge the collaboration and what is a very strong bipartisan tradition of the audit committee. I think all reports were unanimous, a few with additional comments of varying degrees of colour and movement. </span>

She was collegiate and dedicated in her approach to the committee, and I might declare that we did become very fond of each other—in an entirely appropriate fashion, of course. We come from very different sides of politics but greatly enjoyed working together. I look forward to another productive year of work, collaboratively, with the audit committee.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Now I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2022-23. On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present this statement on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, the PBO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is required, under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, to consider the draft budget estimates of both the ANAO and the PBO and to make formal recommendations to both houses of parliament regarding these estimates. This requirement, to make a statement to the parliament in advance of the budget being handed down by a government, is an important transparency measure. It will assist the parliament and the public in making a judgement, tonight and thereafter, on the adequacy of the budget provided to the ANAO and the PBO through a comparison with the requested funding and the committee's recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this year's budget, both the ANAO and the PBO have sought additional funding. The committee has carefully scrutinised the ANAO's and the PBO's draft budget estimates and has resolved to endorse them, subject to further review of the costings and final estimates which may be agreed with the Department of Finance. The committee considers both offices vital in supporting the work of this parliament and in strengthening integrity and transparency in public administration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO is also seeking an additional appropriation. In presenting its draft budget estimates to the committee, the ANAO noted that machinery-of-government changes following the 2022 federal election—in particular, the creation of new departments—will mean that minor additional costs are incurred for mandatory financial statement and performance statement audits. There are additional cost pressures relating to cybersecurity and data storage, as well as financial statement auditing, where specialist expertise, for additional capacity, is required to be purchased from the private sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the total funding request—which is still, of course, subject to a bit of further refinement with the Department of Finance since we last interrogated it—was in the order of $8.3 million over the forward estimates. The JCPAA acknowledges the difficult fiscal outlook faced by, and inherited by, the government, and acknowledges that the ANAO received supplementation in the 2021-22 budget. However, the committee accepts that these cost pressures presented to us are unavoidable and that the additional funding is required to maintain required standards in financial statement auditing, without which the ANAO would be confronted with the need to reduce the level of auditing in other areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the committee's view, the government stands to save more than it spends by meeting the ANAO's modest request. A robust audit function is of critical value to the public sector, driving, as it does, efficiency and effectiveness throughout the public sector. In that context, the JCPAA endorses the ANAO's budget submission, which, as I said, would be subject to any normal parameter changes and minor changes that might be agreed with the Department of Finance and the government, if the government is indeed to fund it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the PBO's estimated expenses for 2022-23 amounted to $9.292 million and it expects to meet the majority of its fiscal requirements from this appropriation. However, since its creation, the PBO has had a special appropriation fund designed to help it meet unexpected cost pressures. This fund was initially $6 million but has run down to $1.8 million over the last decade. The PBO is seeking to have this fund replenished to its original level in this year's budget, and I note that that is its 10th anniversary. The committee regards the fund as an important element of the PBO's operational independence, including independence from executive government, and therefore endorses the proposed appropriation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer for their work in support of the parliament and the JCPAA, and committee members for their thoughtful and detailed consideration of these budget requests. I present a copy of my statement. There you go—I'm done. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  In a matter of weeks, the Australian Human Rights Commission will release their latest national survey on sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. The last report, from 2018, was a very challenging read. It shows that when we discuss sexual harassment in the workplace we're not looking at a small or isolated problem that only affects the occasional person in Australia—that Australia has a deep and wide problem. The 2018 report found that in the previous five years almost two in five women and just over one in four men had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. Let us be clear what this means. This means that in order to earn an income, to contribute to a workplace, to do their job, more than a quarter of Australian workers are having to put up with unwanted sexual misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report told thoroughly shocking stories about what people have had to endure at work. One woman spoke about three incidents in her career in three different places in which she worked: being touched by her manager in a storeroom as a 16-year-old supermarket worker; being locked in a toilet cubicle in her mid-20s with a colleague, who demanded to be kissed; and being publicly groped and insulted by the CEO at a work function some years later. One police officer told a deeply distressing story about having to lock herself in a car at night when on an away job because she'd been sold to a group of detectives who expected to be able to mistreat her. A hotel worker spoke about working as a butler. Her job entailed time spent in guests' rooms to serve them meals and unpack their luggage. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… a female co-worker was sexually assaulted by a guest while unpacking their luggage … she was not the only one of her co-workers that had been sexually harassed by a guest while conducting their required tasks in their rooms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A man named Barry spoke to the commission about his experience working in a rural town:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… one evening while giving his male boss a lift home, his boss said he was lonely and placed his hand on Barry's upper thigh. Barry respectfully declined the advance. Barry told the Commission that the following day, he was told that his services were no longer required. Barry said he was unable to find another job as his former boss would not provide him with a reference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just four stories among hundreds of thousands that could be told.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 Human Rights Commission report found that the majority of people who were sexually harassed at work did not formally report their experience or seek support or advice, with many victims believing that a formal complaint would be viewed as an overreaction or that it was easier to stay quiet. Fewer than one in five people, 17 per cent, made a formal report or complaint in relation to workplace sexual harassment. There's something very wrong with a situation in which this many people experience sexual harassment in the workplace and do not feel that they're able to do anything about it, either because they see no point or because they fear reprisal or the cost involved in taking action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As one woman said to Respect@Work: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a long time I thought that what happened to me was normal—it's just what happens to young women in the workplace. You learn to ignore it as best you can and move on … But nowadays I think that, even if that [is] the case, it shouldn't be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: there is no place for sexual harassment in Australian society or Australian workplaces. By and large, it's men who are the perpetrators of harassment in the workplace, and the message must be sent loudly and clearly: enough is enough. This has to stop. That's why the coalition took action to address these issues when we were in government. We set the agenda to change the culture of Australian workplaces so that we could begin to see workplaces being consistently free from sexual harassment and discrimination. Today's bill builds on the leadership of the coalition government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 we announced an Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces to ensure we more comprehensively understood what was taking place and to develop a pathway for change. That landmark inquiry was world leading, and I want to pay tribute to my former colleague the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, who commenced that inquiry along with Commissioner Kate Jenkins. A few years on, we're used to these topics being front of mind, but I want to pay tribute to those two women, who made sure we didn't turn a blind eye any longer. They took a stand and they are the reason we can debate these matters with clarity and conviction. I'm talking not about a small or isolated problem but about something that has to be given serious attention. One might think that because so often sexual harassment occurs quietly, in hidden moments in workplaces, in underhanded and malicious ways, we can easily miss it or allow ourselves to overlook it. What Kate Jenkins has shown us in recent years is that this is a problem that is pervasive and we all have a responsibility to change the culture of workplaces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry commissioned by Kelly O'Dwyer and undertaken by Kate Jenkins resulted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>, a substantial report that made 55 recommendations to our government. In response, when we were in government we released the Roadmap for Respect, which responded to the report and also outlined a long-term plan for preventing and addressing sexual harassment. That road map included agreeing to—in full, in principle or in part—or noting all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, and it focused particularly on prevention. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government provided over $64 million over the four years in the 2021-22 federal budget to support the implementation of the Roadmap for Respect. In September last year we legislated many of the recommendations in <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Wo</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rk</span>. The Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Act 2021 expressly prohibited sex based harassment. It made it clearer than it has ever been in Australian law that sex based harassment is not acceptable. We corrected gaps in the legislation to make sure all workers were respected. We made clear in the sex discrimination act that MPs, judges and public servants would all be subject to the sex discrimination act. This means that people are protected from sexual harassment regardless of the field in which they work or for whom they work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We established the Respect@Work Council, which brings together leaders from key government regulators and policymakers responsible for sexual harassment policies and complaints to improve coordination, consistency and clarity across existing legal and regulatory frameworks. We also increased the length of time that people have to make a complaint from six months after the incident to 24 months. We made changes to the Fair Work Act to make it clear that being a perpetrator of sexual harassment is a valid reason for dismissal. This was an essential reform, as it made it possible for employers to dismiss a worker who sexually harassed another worker without the risk of them bringing an unfair dismissal claim in response. It was essential that employers respond swiftly when their employee's behaviour is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today is another piece of that puzzle. It follows on from the work that we did in government. It picks up on particular issues that were given initial time for consideration and consultation. I am pleased to say that with work having progressed we support the principle behind this bill. There is much in the bill that we can support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most significant thing the bill does is to put responsibility on workplaces, not simply to react to complaints of harassment or discrimination. We know that many people won't ever make a complaint. It requires workplaces to act proactively to create an environment in which sexual harassment and discrimination is not tolerated. I would have much preferred that this legislation and this debate were not required, but the continual evidence of widespread sexual harassment in workplaces indicates that the bar has to be raised higher. Workplaces need to actively make sure they provide a safe environment for their employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are a few measures that we believe require some change in order to make it easier for businesses to comply and achieve the intention behind this bill. We're not seeking to see boxes ticked; we're not seeking to burden workplaces unnecessarily; but we are seeking to ensure workplaces are safe places for all Australians. If employers can't easily fulfil the obligation the legislation places on them and an undue additional regulatory burden is imposed, we will create more problems than we solve. We must take a path that is achievable and will lead to tangible change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that this bill is the subject of a Senate committee inquiry. That committee is not due to report until 3 November, so we haven't had the benefit of the consideration of this bill by that committee. But we have had the benefit of reading a number of the submissions to that committee. From those submissions the coalition will provide some helpful amendments to ensure the good aims behind this legislation are better achieved. As such, I will move the amendment that has been circulated in my name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to insert section 28M into the Sex Discrimination Act, which would make it unlawful for a person to subject another person to a workplace environment that is hostile on the grounds of sex. This concept already exists under discrimination law, although the provision is drafted broadly. We propose an amendment to align the provision with existing case law. Section 28M defines too broadly what it means to subject the person to a workplace environment that's hostile on the grounds of sex. In particular, the proposed new section does not connect the inappropriate conduct clearly enough with the person who would be the complainant. The provision makes it unlawful for a person to subject another person to a workplace environment that is hostile on the ground of sex. The issue with the way the provision is drafted is that there isn't a requirement for the first person or the second person to actually be in the workplace at the same time or for there to be a temporal connection between the conduct and the harm. For instance, there are businesses which operate on many different sites in different units. It's important that the complaint be related to the activity that goes on at the site or unit in which a person works. In relation to the temporal connection, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has pointed out in their submission: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… from a practical perspective, there are unique circumstances in which an extended lapsed period of time could unfairly punish employers, even where they have taken action to address workplace hostility. For example, consider a scenario in which there exists a cultural problem of sexism at a workplace. If an employer takes action to rectify the situation and ensures that the workplace is no longer "offensive, intimidating or humiliating" to prospective female employees, but a female employee is employed at the workplace at a later date, hears about the prior conduct and is subsequently intimidated, it is likely that proposed section 28M is enlivened. Intimidating conduct has been engaged in and an intimidated person has been in the workplace <span style="font-style:italic;">after the conduct occurred</span>, although the two events were not contemporaneous and there is otherwise no connection between the events and the person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our amendment would amend section 28M to insert 'in relation to' and to delete 'after the conduct occurs', to bring the provision into line with existing case law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill proposes to insert section 47C into the Sex Discrimination Act to establish a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual harassment within a workplace, and gives the Human Rights Commission enforcement powers, as well as powers to inquire into systemic discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Employers are already subject to significant obligations to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace—for example, section 106 of the Sex Discrimination Act makes employers vicariously liable for the actions of their employee or agent. It's already true that an employer can only avoid liability where they can show they took all reasonable steps to prevent an employee or agent from doing those acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, as a Safe Work Australia have pointed out in their submission, there has been extensive work done since <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> to address sexual harassment through relevant legal frameworks, including via workplace health and safety policy makers and regulators. I will quote from their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The model WHS laws establish a comprehensive and robust legal framework to protect workers from risks to their health and safety while at work, including from sexual harassment. The model WHS laws' main objective is to provide a balanced and nationally consistent framework to secure the health and safety of workers. This includes protecting workers and other persons against harm to their health and safety by eliminating or minimising risks arising from work. The model WHS laws aim to provide all workers in Australia with the same standard of health and safety protection regardless of the work they do or where they work. The laws apply broadly to all organisations regardless of size or industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The model WHS laws include a positive duty to eliminate or minimise risks to both physical and psychological health from sexual harassment so far as it is reasonably practicable. There's an appropriate concern that with having two different ways in which a positive duty is imposed but with a slightly different framework and drafting in place there's the potential for confusion and duplication for employers. Again, to quote Safe Work Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendment to the SD Act impose a positive duty on PBCUs in relation to the prevention of workplace sexual harassment. However, it is drafted in different terms to the model WHS laws, which also imposes a positive duty on PCBUs to prevent workplace sexual harassment. Because of these drafting differences, the scope and application of each positive duty may be different. It is not yet clear whether this will be of significance in practice, but it seems to us that it at least has the potential to cause confusion and uncertainty for duty holders. In our view, there may be benefit in more closely aligning the two frameworks to reduce this possibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue in relation to section 47C is outlined by the submission of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… section 47C would require employers and PCBUs to take measures to eliminate "as far as possible" certain conduct. Under work health and safety law, the obligation imposed on PCBUs is to ensure the health and safety of their workers "as far as is reasonably practicable". The widespread use of "reasonably practicable" under work health and safety law has provided PCBUs with a substantial degree of understanding about the meaning of that threshold. There is also extensive case law about the meaning of these words which offers further clarity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They quote from the High Court in Slivak v Lurgi and the test applied by Justice Gaudron of what reasonably practicable means. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new phrase "as far as possible" does not share such clarity—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">of as 'reasonably practicable'. We would adopt that view. And our amendment to section 47C, with the insertion of 'as far as reasonably practical', will more closely align the positive duty created in this bill with the existing obligations on employers under the work health and safety model law. This is essential, as we want to achieve the objectives of this bill without creating unnecessary additional burdens on business, particularly small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of concern regarding the bill is that it seeks to significantly expand the role of the Human Rights Commission. Let me be very clear: I have great respect for the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins and the work that she's done in this space. My concern, again, is about duplication of processes and that workplaces could find themselves being subject to multiple inquiries through multiple bodies simultaneously. With the Human Rights Commission having enforcement functions in relation to the positive duty the same matters could be brought before the work health and safety regulator and the Human Rights Commission at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also concerned that the Human Rights Commission's conciliation role will be compromised if they're required to conduct enforcement action in relation to the positive duty as well as to provide conciliation for the employee bringing forth the complaint. Serving both functions in relation to the same complaint would not be good practice. In order to avoid duplication in enforcement powers in relation to the positive duty, in order to protect the conciliation role of the commission and in order to prevent the duplication of inquiry powers which could see businesses or sectors subject to inquiry by multiple government agencies at the same time our amendment says that the Fair Work Ombudsman should hold enforcement powers in relation to the positive duty and the powers of inquiry in relation to systemic unlawful discrimination. These are powers and functions that are aligned with the existing powers and functions of the Fair Work Ombudsman. The functions of the Fair Work Ombudsman are provided for in section 68(2) of the Fair Work Act and include monitoring compliance with the Fair Work Act and fair work instruments, investigating conduct contrary to the Fair Work Act and fair work instruments, and any other functions conferred on the ombudsman by any other legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Ombudsman can undertake workplace investigations. In relation to adverse action, it can conduct investigations. Where an investigation finds the employer has or had discriminatory practices that are linked to adverse actions for employees or prospective employees, it can take appropriate enforcement actions. Enforcement actions can include issuing compliance notices, enforceable undertakings or commencing proceedings in a court or before the Fair Work Commission. This extends to instituting proceedings for breach of civil remedy provisions, including those that prohibit adverse action, coercion or undue influence in relation to workplace rights, and to adverse action or coercion in relation to industrial activities and those that prohibit contraventions of the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements or national minimum wage orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to adverse action, this includes workplace discrimination on the basis of various protected attributes including sex, sexual orientation and marital status. The Fair Work Ombudsman notes that bullying and harassment, including sexual harassment, can in some circumstances amount to unlawful discrimination, and then falls within its powers. So you can see the link between the role that the Fair Work Ombudsman already provides and the sense in having these matters dealt with by the Fair Work Ombudsman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Fair Work Ombudsman's broader powers in relation to industries: it can conduct inquiries to monitor compliance within an industry, region or supply chain, even where there's no specific allegation of noncompliance with workplace laws; in response to trends in data that indicate systemic non-compliance in particular businesses or industries, as is posited in this legislation; and in response to issues raised in the media and concerns raised with the Fair Work Ombudsman that are directly in the public interest. That is why we support these matters being sent to the Fair Work Ombudsman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move to schedule 4, which deals with representative actions. Schedule 4 of the bill seeks to amend the Human Rights Commission Act to make it easier for unions and other representative groups to bring representative claims to the Federal Court. We believe that this schedule should be deleted. The amendment would allow bodies to commence legal proceedings on behalf of other parties rather than the aggrieved person taking the matter forward themselves. I want to draw the attention of the House to the work of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Representative groups are not prohibited from providing financial or legal support to parties pursuing a representative proceeding in the courts. Rather, they are simply prevented from commencing the proceeding on their behalf. It's not clear how allowing trade unions to commence legal proceedings on behalf of aggrieved persons will lead to better outcomes for these persons, especially in light of the support representative groups can already provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fundamentally, litigants in representative actions need to be aggrieved persons, not bodies that represent, or merely purport, to represent their interests. This is how the existing avenue for class actions rightly operates. The interests of representative bodies do not always align with those who they represent. Allowing these bodies to commence and run representative actions on their behalf can lead to the aggrieved persons' interests being neglected in favour of other motives, such as a desire for a more lucrative settlement or political objectives. Further, representative bodies are not those whose reputations, finances and relationships, are vulnerable during litigation. Allowing representative bodies to be the party instructing lawyers on the running of legal proceedings risks the pursuit of interests which are unrelated to those of the affected individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are sufficient mechanisms to enable representative proceedings in the Federal Court under part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Further loosening of these rules in favour of unions who can pursue their own agendas, rather than those of the complainant, is not warranted. Our amendment proposes to delete schedule 4 and leave the law as it stands in relation to representative actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to costs in schedule 5, the bill inserts a cost-neutral arrangement into the Human Rights Commission Act. This means parties are expected to bear their own costs, with the courts having power to make an alternative determination considering the factors in the legislation, including: financial circumstances of each party to the proceedings; the conduct of the parties, including conduct dealing with the commission; whether any parties have been wholly unsuccessful; whether any parties made an offer in writing to settle; whether the subject matter of the proceedings involves an issue of public importance or any other matter that the court considers relevant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, let me draw the attention of the House to the words of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">59. There is no obvious reason why proceedings brought with<span style="&#xA;    font-size:12pt;&#xA;  "></span>… respect of discrimination claims ought to depart from the traditional rule in Australia that <span style="font-style:italic;">costs follow the event</span>, with broad discretion already conferred upon the courts to vary the application of this rule depending on the particular circumstances. This existing procedure, developed across centuries of the evolution of the common law, offers several critically important benefits which should not be discarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">60. First, costs awards disincentivise unmeritorious litigation that can be significantly costly for all parties involved. Allowing litigation to be commenced without the risk of indemnifying the other party for their legal costs risks an increase in unmeritorious, vexatious and speculative claims being made. Of course, the courts will retain discretion to restrict the making of such claims; however often the ulterior purpose of the litigation will not be plain on the facts. Where it is more discrete, the risk of paying the opposing party's costs deters such litigation from being brought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think discretion as to costs best sits with the courts, and we endorse the views of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in relation to the place of costs orders in the industrial relations system. Our amendments will remove schedule 5 of the bill and leave costs determinations to the discretion of the court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendment that we seek to make is to retain equality of opportunity in the objects clause of the act. We believe equality of opportunity should be retained because equality of opportunity offers a state of fairness in which individuals are treated equally. People are given the same opportunities, and it is up to them to exercise their talents and their abilities in order to achieve the things that they wish to pursue. We think that this is a fundamental principle that should be retained in the objects of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes proposed in this bill with these amendments do important work in ensuring Australian workplaces are not hostile to either men or women on the grounds of sex. As a community, it's essential that we draw a line under the unacceptable behaviour in workplaces and beyond that has been too common for too long. In doing so, we must ensure that businesses are supported to meet the new obligations under the bill. I welcome the 12-month period between assent and commencement. This will be essential time for businesses to learn about the new obligations placed on them to develop new protocols and policies and to train their staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this point—and this is probably the most important thing I'm going to say in relation to this bill—the role of the Australian Human Rights Commission is essential. The Human Rights Commission is responsible for developing guidance materials and must ensure materials are clear and simple for all businesses to understand. It's important these obligations apply to all workplaces, but, as noted in the explanatory memorandum, a big bank or other corporation with a human resources department will have more resources at its disposal to ensure it's compliant, particularly compared to a small business such as a corner store which has only a few staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The guidance materials must meet the needs of different types of businesses too. The risks businesses must manage under this act and under the work health and safety framework vary significantly across industries. As the Housing Industry Association noted in their submission, it's extremely difficult for a business to control the various actors on a worksite—the various trades, subcontractors, clients, state based regulators, union officials, the owner sometimes, and others. Similarly, in a business like a pub, a person creating an unsafe work environment for a second person may be an intoxicated patron rather than an employee of the business. The guidelines will need to address the full range of different businesses and the circumstances in which they find themselves. Guidance from the Human Rights Commission must meet the needs of business, based on the different types of workplaces that exist across Australia and the different types of businesses that will be subject to this bill. I call on the Human Rights Commission to ensure that they have given adequate support to businesses to comply with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must continue to work as a society to continually improve and to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and that our workplaces are set up in such a way that someone who works hard, regardless of their background, can reach the highest of heights, because we should not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace or anywhere else.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this budget makes our tax system more sustainable by making sure multinationals pay a fairer share of tax in Australia, by extending successful tax compliance programs, and by giving the ATO the resources they need to crack down on tax dodging.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can pay to service the debt that was left to us—when borrowing costs are the fastest growing budget pressure, rising at more than 14 per cent a year over a decade.</span>

This represents funding for the endorsed March 2022 budget measures, the 2022 election commitments and other decisions taken by the government in the October 2022 budget. The Supply Act (No. 2) 2022-2023 contains, broadly, five-twelfths of the estimated 2022-23 annual appropriations which are required to support services which are not the ordinary annual services of government such as capital works and services; payments to or for states, territories and local government authorities; equity injections; and funding for new administered outcomes not previously endorsed by the parliament. The balance of supply appropriations, representing broadly seven-twelfths of the 2022-23 annual appropriations, is included in Supply Bill (No. 4) 2022-2023, which is part of the additional 2022-23 supply bills that were introduced into the parliament concurrently with the budget bills on 25 October 2022. Together with the Supply Act (No. 2) 2022-2023 and the Supply Bill (No. 4) 2022-2023, currently before the parliament, this bill presents a complete view of the proposed annual appropriations for services that are not the ordinary annual services of government for the 2022-23 financial year.</span>

This includes $495 million in equity for Airservices Australia, as part of the COVID-19 response package, to continue to provide critical air navigation, air traffic control and aviation fire and rescue services across Australia, and $328 million in equity to upgrade the National Broadband Network to deliver fibre-ready access to a further 1.5 million premises by late 2025.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also contains an Advance to the Finance Minister provision of $3.6 billion to provide the government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Three billion dollars of the AFM provision is set aside for COVID-19 and natural disaster or other national emergency response related expenditure, and $600 million for other urgent general and unforeseen expenditure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These AFM provisions are similar to those currently included in the Supply Act (No. 2) 2022-23, except to expand the current provisions that are statutorily limited to COVID-19 related expenditure to also support natural disaster and other natural emergency response related expenditure. This expansion has been proposed in light of the recent flood events and would enable the government to make funding available for responses to events such as flood and fire in a timely manner, should the circumstances require. We all hope that they do not. Once the bill commences, the AFM provisions in the Supply Act (No. 2) 2022-23 would no longer be available for allocation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in light of the size of the AFM, the strong accountability and transparency arrangements that have been put in place since March 2020 will be continued, including a regular media release, in weeks when the AFMs are issued, which reports and reconciles the use of the AFM provision. Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the updated 2022-23 portfolio budget statements, tabled in parliament in relation to the October 2022 budget.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2022-2023 provides appropriations for new decisions taken by government in the October 2022 budget for the operations of the parliamentary departments. This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of approximately $19.2 million. The Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 2022-2023 contains broadly five-twelfths of the estimated 2022-23 annual appropriations which are required to support the operations of the parliamentary departments. The balance of appropriations, representing broadly seven-twelfths of the 2022-23 annual appropriations, is included in the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-2023, which is part of the additional 2022-23 supply bills that were introduced into parliament concurrently with the budget bills on 25 October 2022, together with the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act (No. 1) 2022-2023 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-2023, which is currently before the parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill presents a complete view of the proposed annual appropriations for the expenditure of the parliamentary departments for the financial year of 2022-23. Importantly—in a matter that I know will be of interest to the crossbench—the bill proposes appropriations of parliamentary services of approximately $19.2 million, including $4.2 million to support its operations—including to increase the capacity of the Parliamentary Library to support parliamentarians with advice and research and to increase Hansard and Broadcasting services staffing levels to support increased parliamentary committee activity. I'm sure all members of this House will agree with me when I comment in passing on the excellent work that these departments do on behalf of all members of parliament. The details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the updated 2022-23 Portfolio Budget Statements tabled in the parliament in relation to the October 2022 budget. I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

Importantly, this bill must be passed this sitting week to provide certainty of supply for the ongoing business of government for the remainder of 2022-23, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery. The appropriations proposed in this bill provide an estimated seven-twelfths of the 2022-23 annual appropriations, which are broadly based on the March 2022 budget estimates and adjusted for a small number of programs and entities that received more than five-twelfths of their annual appropriations in the 2022-23 supply acts. This was to provide flexibility for the selected entities to manage uneven expenditure early in the financial year. The bill reflects the structure of government in line with the Administrative Arrangements Orders which commenced on 1 July this calendar year.</span>

The Supply Bill (No. 4) 2022-2023 provides for annual appropriations that are not for the ordinary annual services of government, such as capital works and services, payments to the states and territories and local governments, and equity injections for broadly the last seven months of 2022-23. annual appropriations that are not for the ordinary annual services of government for broadly the first five months of 2022-23 were provided by the Supply Act (No. 2) 2022-2023. This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just under $10 billion. Again, the bill must be passed in this sitting week to provide certainty of supply for the ongoing business of government for the remainder of 2022-23, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery.</span>

This was to provide flexibility for the selected entities to manage uneven expenditure early in this financial year. The bill reflects the structure of government in line with the new Administrative Arrangements Order which commenced on 1 July this year. </span>

The details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the updated 2022-23 portfolio budget statements tabled in relation to the October 2022 budget. I commend the bill to the chamber. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:27</span>):  I'll be very brief. Considering the lateness of the hour, I rise to speak on the cognate debate on Supply Bill (No. 3), Supply Bill (No. 4) and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2022-2023. The opposition will support the passage of the bills, in accordance with convention. It's important that the appropriate functions of government continue and departments are resourced to effectively carry out their duties when the examination of the appropriation bills through parliamentary processes means there is the inevitable delay of their passage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say, from my cursory look, there is a lot for us to examine. Labor have confirmed under their government that growth will be lower, unemployment will be higher, inflation will be higher for longer, electricity and gas prices will be higher, and the instant asset write-off for small businesses will end. There is, indeed, a lot to examine, especially on behalf of the 150,000 Australians who will find themselves unemployed because of this budget. What's missing is a coherent plan to bring down the cost of living. We've had lots of announcements, lots of bundling together of election promises, just not a coherent plan. It could be that, once the examination of the appropriation bills has progressed through the House and been considered by the other place, a plan may indeed miraculously appear, but I remain not very optimistic. In the meantime, of course, we will support the passage of the supply bills, in keeping with convention. I look forward to further debate on the issues at hand. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in Australia voted for change in the election in May, but so much of this budget is more of the same. We've been told that energy prices are going to go up by over 50 per cent over the next two years, while at the same time gas corporations are counting record profits. We've been told that revenue into the government coffers from gas is going to decrease by hundreds of millions of dollars in the same year and in the same period as one of the biggest gas booms in our history. We're told that rents are going to skyrocket, but there is no action on capping or freezing rents. We're told that the shortage of public housing is going to increase over this period, and yet the only investment the government is making in public and community housing is for 20,000 homes over the next five years, which doesn't even match the annual increase.</span>

What are the tough choices that we're all making here? What are the tough choices that the billionaires and millionaires are making, who are going to get the $9,000 extra a year out of the stage 3 tax cuts? We've been told that life in Australia is going to get tougher over the next few years. The cost of living is going to go up and real wages are going to stagnate, but at the same time we're going to continue to see record corporate profits. Not only that; those same people making those record profits are going to get an extra $9,000 a year.</span>

Time and again we are told that the parameters for what's possible in politics are narrow. We could, for instance, step up and build hundreds of thousands of good-quality public homes over the next few years. We could scrap the stage 3 tax cuts and bring dental and mental health into Medicare. We could bring forward the Paid Parental Leave scheme right now so hundreds of thousands of extra parents could benefit. We could make child care universal and free right now if we scrapped the stage 3 tax cuts.</span>

That's why we're moving this amendment, and those are the people—the people doing it tough right now—who the Greens will be fighting for over the next three years.</span>

The impact, if this were to be carried, would be to negate the bill. That's what would happen. A second reading amendment, if it were to be carried, would negate the bill.

That puts in jeopardy the wages of every public servant—including, I might add, the public servants delivering the exact sorts of payments that the member might want to refer to. The public servants delivering Centrelink payments are dependent, right now, on the amendment that was just moved by the Greens failing. The stunt that has been moved is to say to the people who work for us in this building, who make this place operate, who we rely on—for the people who every individual on the payment system in Australia relies on—that for the sake of an extra bit of debating at 8.30 pm on budget night, after the press gallery have largely gone home, that you're willing to play a game of putting at risk the wages of every one of those people for the operation of government.

To actually pick people's wages, people who work for the Commonwealth, is something that—I thought the sorts of arguments as to whether supply would be jeopardised in Australia were dispensed quite some decades ago. If it were to come back, it had not occurred to me that it might be members of the Greens political party who would raise it.</span>

It's just low doing that on a supply bill, because, I can tell you what, your wages won't be affected by this one. They're covered elsewhere. You'll be fine. But each time someone opens a door or welcomes you through security or cleans your office, each time you talk to someone who relies on the payment system, each time someone wants a government service don't forget this night.

The Leader of the House and I have been doing this for a long time—a decade and a half—and we've had our fair share of wins and fights, but neither of us can remember a time when a rookie error like this was made. There is a time for every season under the sun, not just in life but in this House. There is a time for standing up for what we believe in quite passionately and moving and using forms of the House for that. I even applaud the member for Watson for the great stunt where his team snuck off to the airport but didn't quite sneak off, whilst our side did, and then they came back in for three or four raucous hours of stunts.</span>
