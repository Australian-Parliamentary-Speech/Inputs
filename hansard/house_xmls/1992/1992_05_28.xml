        We jointly wish to voice our concern on behalf of the Undersigned Petitioners about the most unproductive and intolerant policies of certain institutions and Governmental Departments in the relation to humanitarian aid to Russia on the one hand, and providing the Australian farmer with income and therefore a contribution towards the rural community of Australia. The Undersigned Petitioners believe that Australia as primarily a rural continent with an immense potential for the future as a supplier of food to the world, should spare no efforts to free herself from foreign financial interference and domination by foreign product brokers as such seem to be the case in the Australian meat and wool industries, but rather make herself known as a free producer in her own right on a global level.

        We firmly believe that in pursuit of such an international stand it would seem to be the primary duty of the relative Department responsible for Farming, Trading and International Relations to seek out marketing opportunities, especially in the newly formed Sovereign States in the world. Here, we believe, long-term Credit-Facilities on a Bi-Lateral basis may prove a sound investment. Whilst the harsh winter in Russia has given their brave people a bitter and most shocking taste of their new freedom, suffering misery and starvation, while the Australian sheep farmer is pushed to the brink of bankruptcy, not being able to dispose of a surplus of sixty million sheep. It is indeed heartbreaking and inconceivable by a healthy mind watching on television how Australian farmers must shoot their sheep by the thousands and bulldoze the corpses into deep trenches.

        The Undersigned Petitioners humbly submit to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives that the Grand Master of the Sovereign World Order of the White Cross, in cooperation with his District Commanders in European and American White Cross Commanderies have undertaken every step to negotiate and conclude deals between the Lord Mayor of St. Petersburg, His Excellency Prof. Dr. Anatoli Sobtchak and District Commander His Excellency Prof. Dr. Yuri Moskalenko, Marquis of Neva, on the one side, and the National Farmers Federation of Australia, the Sheep Meat Council of Australia and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation on the other side, with the result that the Lord of Knights has been severely misled, to say the least, by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, who claimed that there were no sheep available for such, aid to Russia and claiming further that they have resolved the matter of Humanitarian Aid to the `Soviet Union' already themselves. We hold that such news would have been welcomed indeed by the Order of the White Cross, if such actions were to be true, but the Chairman of the Sheep Meat Council of Australia, Mr. Rick Farley, had confirmed in writing to the Lord of Knights that there were ample sheep available for purchase within Australia at a price of $5 or less and that they would be only too happy to sell as many as the Order of the White Cross would wish to take. He further mentioned, per telephone, that in fact the Russian Delegation conferring with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Chairman had left disappointed, because of the extra high price that they were asked to pay for sheep meat, and that there had been no grant of even one pound of meat as Humanitarian Aid. The Order of the White Cross already had in mind to arrange purchase and shipment of sheep numbering in lots of fifty thousand to one hundred thousand each time and funded by the financial efforts of our District Commanderies, the Member Orders of the Confederation of Chivalry and the generosity of the House of Amena.

Dr Paul Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh, the Lord of Knights, had requested the Honourable Michael MacKellar, M.P. for Warringah to seek landing and loading permission for the Russian planes, requesting an early answer since the humanitarian operation will be rendered useless if the matter drags on until the next harvest time in Russia. Our aid could then only be interpreted as a mockery towards the people who have endured the murderous pain of Bolshevism for seventy years.

It should have come as a shock to all responsible in the wellbeing and government of the nations that the predicted time (the year 2000) was a mere optimistic assumption, a blind tapping into the unknown by Scientists in their uncertainty. A gross depletion of the ozone layer has already started and has built-up a huge danger field across Europe, Northern Asia and Northern America forming an increasing cloud of chlorine monoxide which is responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. We trust that all the Honourable Members of the House fully understand the catastrophic effects which will transform the entire planet once the protective ozone layer has disappeared.

        Surely no responsible executive in whatever field and in whatever part of this world would in full view of these approaching dangers subject mankind and the delicate web of life to devastation and destruction, and yet we notice that very little is being done. Instead of emergency measures worldwide, it appears that business continues as usual, since possibly few would dare to upset Electorates in fear of higher unemployment (due to the closure of industries responsible for this ill course), apparently it seems unpopular "to rock the boat".

        We have noticed the immense destruction and total exploitation of the natural resources in the former Soviet Union caused during Bolshevik Rule keeping embarrassing and devastating damages to the environment away from the public eye, and it is not far fetched to assume that similar coverups are done as the general rule in the so-called industrial nations, including Australia. We have noticed with utmost concern and in sheer desperation that all warnings, appeals, protests and submissions have failed to impress any particular Government of the day, and it is with the same concern for the sake of all, that the Undersigned Petitioners in all humbleness and respect remind the Honourable Members of the House, that not only their own lives, but the lives of their own children will bear the consequences together with the Australian nation, indeed with mankind and nature, of the entire globe if measures are not implemented immediately. It may not even be for the sake of ourselves (since the measures come too late for us) but for the gradual recovery of the Ozone Layer offering an eventual liveable future for our children and grandchildren.

        We hold that for the bare survival of the inhabitants of this planet, financial priorities must give way to environmental priorities, curbing or freezing the actions of International Bankers and their Monetary Fund, which in all fairness must be held responsible for the situation mankind is in now. We must replace industrial policy with practical and natural support of our communities as a whole. We further believe that in the course of such a change of policy for the general public worldwide, diversification and simplification appear to be the only option open if we care to achieve a maximum positive effect. To educate ladies in spraying their hair so many times a day surely exposes the dark side of advertising and mass-marketing. People spray here and there and everywhere, be it for improving the odour in their houses, spray paint their walls, attack flying insects and hidden cockroaches or whatever the reason for spraying may be, including graffiti on trains and walls by the youngsters of our society today.

        If it is believed that a family of five must possess six cars in order to be up to the standards then it is surely a warning sign of excessive indulgence, mentally ill to say the least. Our forebears were living happily and contentedly using horse carts and bicycles. The effectiveness of these simple means of transportation had been best demonstrated by the Vietminh winning an entire war against the French, mainly with the transportation help of bicycles. We still have the option to rapidly introduce solar and electric power in replacement of coal and oil. Unfortunately it seems that such concept bears very little consideration by the powerful rulers of the world today, since oil appears to be still targeted as the major energy source for the future, otherwise the Gulf War would not have been fought, oil exploration in the sea would not be intensified and the American Secretary of State Mr Baker would not have had such a longing smile for the oil fields of Baku in Azerbhaijan.

        We believe that it is of national importance for Australia to fulfil at last the great dream and promise made by the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke for the planting of millions of trees on this Continent, thus becoming a reality and not a mere vote catching fantasy. Australia, indeed, possesses the means and the resources, the people and the reason to create forest belts across the Continent, together with huge lakes and dams being a counter measure and possibly the only safeguard for the survival of all creatures on this Continent. We, the Undersigned petitioners, humbly submit that our Almighty Creator may still have some Grace in store for us all, that we should not adopt a fatalistic or selfish attitude, but rather believe in a very humble saying: "If I would know that the world is coming to an end tomorrow, I would still plant a tree today!" It could well be that a selfless nationwide thinking in these terms may trigger a nationwide revitalisation programme being the true conquest against the decertification of the nation's lands.

        It is with humble submission that we, the Undersigned Petitioners wish to alert the Honourable Members of the House on this issue and we request taking steps as a matter of emergency, irrespective of forthcoming elections or political problems otherwise. That the Honourable Members of the House may contemplate that the heating-up of our climate would not only destroy the vegetation and therefore the basis of nourishment for most creatures, including man, but would also prevent a regeneration of the environment within several thousand years of future, thus being the end of the line for the planet and variety of life as we know it. The Undersigned Petitioners have submitted similar requests or are in the process of doing so to nations in all parts of our world. Since our concern encompasses each and every environment violation and we are certainly concerned with the future of the diminishing Taiga in Siberia and the rain forests of the Amazon. We are alarmed about the forward moving deserts in Africa and elsewhere, particularly since this phenomenon is related to man's hazardous exploitation to which he subjects any environment where money can be made or those parts of nature which have yet not proven to be a source of income. We therefore may respectfully include the many repeated warnings from all parts of the world, including from some scientists themselves, to keep hands off Antarctica as well as northern regions in similar climatic conditions. If the Honourable Members of the House may contemplate the degree of cruelty man has already imposed and will do so in the future upon the creatures of nature (man claims to be a caretaker on behalf of God), since documentaries have already been shown on Australian television, demonstrating the pitiful condition of sheep blinded due to cataracts in the mountainous regions of Chile and other parts of South America, caused by the ozone layer depletion. We do not believe that the hospital service in Australia will be adequate to deal with millions of people suffering such cataracts and approaching blindness thereof.

       Last year the Liberal and National parties made history with a package for Australia; they called it Fightback. I do not propose to deal with the debate of the last few months—the GST being a fightback to high inflation; the wages policy, a fightback to the 1800s labour market policies; the health policy, a fightback to the Fraser years of ever changing policies. What I want to talk about today is the package being a fightback to the sick Canberra and sick south-eastern New South Wales we had before 1983, when unemployment was higher in the region than it is now, even in a world recession.

        The economies of south-eastern New South Wales and the ACT are becoming more and more integrated. The ACT and the 15 local government areas surrounding it contain half a million people—500,000 people. The economies are integrated through a range of industries: the dairy industry, with 30 per cent of the New South Wales milk production coming to Canberra; the ski industry, worth $500m; the fishing industry, worth $15m which, along with the vegetable industry, is now having discussions with the ACT about cooperative marketing in the region. Canberra and Queanbeyan are the geographic centre of a region with a wool clip worth $300m.

        It may be of interest for members to know that only 28 per cent of Federal public servants are in Canberra; 72 per cent are outside the ACT borders. Queanbeyan office space is made use of by ACT and New South Wales public services and by a range of private industries. The Eurobodalla and Shoalhaven areas of the region are continually used by ACT people on holidays, visiting the areas, having days out or periods of rest, sometimes just over a weekend. There is a great movement between the Eurobodalla-Shoalhaven area and Canberra. People live in some of the areas surrounding Canberra—the Yarrowlumla Shire, the Tallaganda Shire and the Yass Shire—so there is a great and increasing integration between the people of the region.

        The Fightback proposal is a fightback to 1983, when a four-storey building in Queanbeyan was totally empty—but is now well and truly occupied—and when public servants were not reduced in numbers but were sent to Sydney and Melbourne. It is a fightback to 1975-83, when public servants were sent to expensive accommodation in those cities. They were transferred to areas of high population, less congenial environment and expensive accommodation against the principles of decentralisation. Many of those sections have returned to Canberra over the past nine years.

Fightback is a fightback to the Fraser years of low economic and social activity in the region. Business will not want it. Canberra people visit the South Coast in large numbers for weekends, holidays and days out. They visit the Snowy Mountains in the winter with friends and families.

        The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his deputy, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), felt that a bit of Canberra bashing and a bit of Public Service bashing would not go astray in their Fightback package. The Deputy Leader said that his Government would kneecap the Public Service. The Leader of the Opposition was more localised, more subtle but nonetheless threatening in his statement that sections of the Public Service would be transferred from Canberra to the real world of Sydney and Melbourne. These remarks were espoused because they like to shaft the Public Service and Canberra—two national institutions which are shafted by many—instead of blaming themselves, any of the 15 houses of parliament all over Australia, big business, unions or some other clay pigeon.

It is not a place where Federal MPs live for most of the time. Few stay here for more than 100 nights a year. The work of most MPs is out in the field—in their electorates around Australia. Canberra is not even dominated by public servants. Seventy-two per cent of Federal public servants live outside the ACT and Canberra.

Yet a public servant there complained, `I'm pushed in, shepherded, nursed and above all cut off, alone. Whitehall envelops me'. That experience is less likely to happen in Canberra and Queanbeyan because it is harder to insulate oneself from the real world of farming—within a distance of 20 kilometres—or from people who are cleaners, plumbers, drivers or base grade clerks, because they live much closer and use the same shopping centres. Local radio and television news is about the real world, too, and is an added bonus to the national stories and State stories that go over the air waves in the metropolises of Melbourne and Sydney.

        A point that has been missed by the Opposition is that relocation does not solve isolation in the Public Service. If there is anything wrong with the Public Service, it is really we who are to blame. We in this Parliament are supposed to be the bosses. What the Liberal and National parties are indicating is that they will go back to the Fraser years and previous years, when a lot of the management of government was left to the public servants. We in this House are the people who are supposed to be in charge. If we employ the wrong people or if we do not give them the right objectives, we cannot very well complain when we go to them and they give us a narrow view. We cannot complain about their narrow view; we employed them. It is our responsibility, and it is our responsibility to monitor them. We are paid full time to do that. We are in charge. We are the ones who should take the blame if we are getting a narrower range of advice from public servants. They will put up the advice which is likely to be accepted by government. We ought to accept our responsibilities as parliamentarians.

In fact, we are attempting to increase the efficiency of services provided by government and to make them more accessible to the people who use them. I was astounded to hear the honourable member for Eden-Monaro suggest that we are the bosses of the Public Service. We operate in a partnership with the Public Service. We act in a professional manner. We, as members of parliament, are servants of the public. We are here to serve the public, as are the public servants who are employed in government departments. We should both be striving for an improvement in the efficiency and delivery of services to the public, and to provide the public with access. I totally reject what the honourable member said regarding that aspect of the matter.

        I want to dwell on some of the objectives that the coalition is trying to achieve. One of our objectives is to provide greater mobility for public servants so that they can move in and out of the Public Service and gain experience in both the public and private sectors, so that they have a broader experience of what the economics of this land are about and are able to improve their expertise and experience in a very wide range of occupations and activities. We will be providing the opportunity for public servants to move in and out of the public sector so that they can gain from those experiences in the private sector as well.

        Moving departmental heads and sections out of Canberra is an example of the principles of decentralisation. What the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has claimed is that he wants to centralise everything here in Canberra.

        Of course, public servants in government departments administer government policies and serve the public of Australia. We need to equip them in the best possible way so that they can do that. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, the Fightback package spells out a number of estimated net savings in departmental efficiencies amounting to $249m. We will increase the efficiency of the Public Service and program delivery by providing greater flexibility to departmental heads and reducing administrative, running and operating costs. The coalition will give departmental heads maximum management flexibility and responsibility by providing a single-line budget so that they can determine their own resource priorities.

However, many public servants within the Canberra area want the opportunity of greater experience outside the Public Service so that they can build on their experience and equip themselves to provide the greatest service to the Australian community.

He talked about the importance of transferring people between the Public Service and the private sector. Obviously, that is entirely desirable. This Government has enhanced that process. I think it is important to build up that kind of transfer so that the Public Service is representative of the skills of every part of the private sector and the wider community, including women, ethnic groups and Aborigines.

        But what we are talking about in this motion is the proposal that is central to the Fightback package: transferring public servants from Canberra to Melbourne and Sydney. Anything that is more anathema to the idea of decentralisation is hard to imagine. What is being proposed are ways of contributing to the urban sprawl in Melbourne and Sydney. In Canberra we have a successful form of decentralisation which is ensuring that the largest inland city in Australia is drawing people away from those cities and spreading out population in Australia successfully and effectively.

        The honourable member for Bendigo also said that he admired the professional skills of the Public Service. I am very glad to hear that. But it is quite clear that his party leaders do not. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has talked publicly about kneecapping the Public Service. He has talked about the need to massively cut the Public Service. We are not arguing against improving efficiency—that is a task that has to go on all the time. But we are arguing against the central element of a large part of the Fightback package which is about reducing the extent and quality of public services. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not saying that the Opposition just wants to improve efficiency: he is saying that we spend too much on education, health, police, Aborigines, roads and railways. He is planning to cut back every one of those areas. That is a way of undermining the well-being of the Australian community.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has characterised that in his extraordinary comment about kneecapping the Public Service.

        Even more extraordinary is his comment that the trouble with bureaucrats is that they do not eat their young. Any more extraordinary exaggeration is hard to imagine. Even giving him some leeway for hyperbole, that is an abhorrent way of describing what ought to happen in the Public Service. He said that he was simply saying that public servants need to improve their efficiency; that they need to cut off activities when they are no longer required. But what he said was that the problem with bureaucrats is that they do not eat their young. That is an obnoxious metaphor which all of us must directly and clearly reject. He has backed away from that. He is embarrassed by it now. However, that is a statement which it is important for people in Canberra to remember. It is something that is important for people in the rest of Australia to remember. It is important to remember that someone in a leadership position in the Opposition used such an obnoxious metaphor about what he imagines public servants should be doing.

        —As the honourable member has said, Fightback is an ideological attack on the public sector. It is not a balanced comment which says, `We need to keep a balanced relationship between the public and private sectors. We need to ensure that they cooperate effectively so that both can operate efficiently'. That is not what honourable members opposite are saying. What they are saying is that they will assault the public sector so as to build up privilege in the Australian community. The services that are provided by the public sector—health, education, public transport, police and so on—are central to the well-being of every Australian. Yet the Opposition parties are saying, `We are going to reduce the extent and quality of those services; we are going to attack them'. That is demonstrated more vividly by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition than by anybody else with his appalling exaggeration about bureaucrats not eating their young.

At the moment I believe it is close to $150,000m—close to $10,000 for every Australian man, woman and child. The servicing of this debt has become in itself a major problem for the Australian economy, and each month the situation gets worse. These days if we have a month where our external debt gets only $1 billion worse, we applaud it as a good result. It is a problem which must be addressed, but so far this Government seems to have been powerless to do anything about it.

        The other product of this Government's economic mismanagement is the appalling level of unemployment—and particularly youth unemployment, which is of great concern to every parent in this country.

        What is the answer to these dual problems of debt and unemployment? It is certainly not the centralist, interventionist platform of the Labor Party. Real jobs must be created by the private sector, and tourism—which is the central point of my motion this morning—is perhaps the only industry at the moment which has the potential to solve some of our most fundamental and concerning economic problems. Tourism is an industry where there has been strong growth in recent years despite the recession. It is a industry in which we have a monopoly. Australia, the product we have to sell to the world, is unique. There is only one Gold Coast, and that happens to be here in Australia. Our product—Australia from Cape York to Tasmania, from Cairns to Broome, from Alice to Albany—is a marvellous product that we have to sell to the world. There is only one Australia, and it is ours.

They are people who are waiting to welcome overseas tourists and give them the service that is going to make Australia a world class tourist destination and enable it to continue to be so. Tourism and hospitality are our largest earners of export dollars, and this achievement by the tourism industry has actually come about with very little help from government—not that much assistance has been sought.

        The potential is there for tourism to explode and provide some hope for the future of young people who have become so disillusioned about their job and education prospects. But the key word here in my motion is `potential'. `Potential' is an important word. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described tourism in his One Nation statement as `one of the great success stories of the 1980s and one of the stars of the 1990s'. This was somewhat belated recognition. The word `tourism' has not previously been in his colourful vocabulary.

        In the past, tourism has not been taken seriously enough by governments or, indeed, by the public at large. Yes, it has been tainted to some extent by the excesses and extremes of the 1980s. There have been mistakes. But now it is time for this industry to be taken seriously and to be given the due recognition that it deserves. It is particularly important that the finance sector be encouraged to support the development of tourism infrastructure. Even greater tax incentives than those offered recently by the Government in One Nation will be needed. Competing destinations with Australia are much more generous with these types of incentives.

        I am pleased that the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), is here at the table this morning to listen to this debate, for he has been instrumental in bringing about a situation where we are optimistic about attracting 10 million overseas visitors to Australia per annum by the year 2000. This can not happen unless there is a rapid expansion of the tourism infrastructure. At the moment there is a desperate shortage of hotel rooms in major centres—particularly the Gold Coast and Cairns, which are two of our most popular destinations for overseas tourists. For the first time in many years there are no new hotels under construction on the Gold Coast.

If we are to reach this goal of 10 million visitors, the Government must act today. Hotels do not pop up out of the ground overnight. There are very long lead times.

        The other key element in allowing tourism to reach its potential is to allow it to reduce its costs of operation. Labour costs in the hotel industry in Australia make up 41 per cent of hotel operating costs. That compares with an average of 25 per cent of operating costs elsewhere. We labour in this country under an archaic industrial relations system. Penalty rates, for example, which continue to plague the tourist industry, must go and will go under a coalition government. The tourism industry needs the abolition of payroll tax; it does not need the superannuation guarantee levy that this Government wants to thrust upon it; it needs the abolition of land tax; it needs the abolition of the training guarantee levy and a host of other government charges.

        The one telling statistic that I think every Australian needs to be aware of is that for every additional 25,000 overseas visitors to this country, 1,400 jobs are created. Tourism is the answer in so many respects to the unemployment problem. No other industry is so labour intensive. No other industry can offer jobs to our kids or the training opportunities for them to develop the skills and expertise that they will need to ensure that Australia as a tourist destination is backed by a level of professionalism and service consciousness not matched anywhere else in the world. It is time for us in this country to get serious about the tourism industry.

        —It is good that everyone in this House supports the tourist industry although we have different perspectives and different views on how we can best support that industry. The tourist industry derived some $25.1 billion in 1990-91, of which some $17.9 billion was domestic. The difference, some $7 billion, was in foreign earnings, which is great news; it is very good to see.

        Tourism currently accounts for 450,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, or 5.8 per cent of our work force. The industry generated over 120,000 new jobs during the 1980s. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism, as I said, amounted to more than $7 billion in 1990-91, up some 15 per cent on 1989-90. This accounted for some 10 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. It is important to recognise that tourism is one of the most important and expanding industries we have.

        A point that needs to be recognised in regard to investment is that tourist accommodation projects worth more than $10.5 billion are due for completion between 1991 and 1994. With respect to tax revenue, it is estimated that total indirect taxes derived from the tourist industry in 1990-91 totalled around $3.4 billion. It is estimated conservatively, even if the figure of the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), is wrong—and I would hope his figure of 10 million tourists is right—that there will be between six million and eight million tourists to Australia by the year 2000.

        In March 1992, short term resident departures totalled 172,200, up 0.4 per cent on the figure of March 1991. On the topic of domestic tourism, in 1990-91 Australian residents aged 14 and over undertook 49 million trips of at least one night's duration and spent 215.5 million nights away from home in Australia. It is important to recognise that the biggest component of the tourist industry is, and will remain for quite a time at least, the domestic tourist market; in other words, Australian families going on holiday. As I said, some $17 billion worth of money was spent last year by Australian families. The Government and the Opposition in this debate agree on that, but that is where it ends.

        The difference lies in the Opposition's policy on Fightback, the goods and services tax and industrial relations, all of which have a massive effect on the tourist industry. A GST would put a tax on tourism, both products and services, and replace a wholesale sales tax of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. It would be a tax on exports, that is, on the $7 billion that we gain in foreign earnings.

        It is interesting to note that in 1990 Sweden adopted a VAT. There was a drop of 13 per cent in inbound tourists. On 1 January this year, Sweden reduced the VAT on tourism. Canada, another country that has a VAT, has a rebate on accommodation spending. Of course, such incentives mean that people are more likely to go to countries like that than to Australia—so the GST has a negative effect on tourism. Under coalition policy, international air fares are zero rated;  domestic fares are not. Therefore it would be more lucrative for people to take a holiday overseas than spend their money in Australia. Fightback would cost domestic airlines some $250m a year and, as I have said, it would chase away tourists.

        There are two aspects to the industrial relations policy. One is that there is no doubt that some people believe we should run our tourist industry like Mexico does—with cheap labour and no training. The previous speaker said the training guarantee levy should be abolished; if any industry needs training, it is the tourist industry because of the great growth potential. But what does the Opposition want to do? It wants to abolish it and downgrade our potential to capitalise on tourism. Certainly I do not believe that our industry should be run like Mexico or other South American countries where labour is paid $1 an hour.

If honourable members opposite take away from them their 17 1/2 per cent leave loading, which is comparable to or less than that paid in most OECD countries anyway, they are going to limit the ability of those people to go on holidays.

The Gold Coast is nearly as good as central Queensland; it is not quite as good, because it does not have the Barrier Reef, for a start.

        The Fightback package, of course, has been designed to maximise Australia's international tourism potential. The recent Australian Tourist Commission study on the future projection of the development of Australian tourism indicated that present trends and policy objectives would see 6.2 million international visitors coming to Australia by the year 2000. The Fightback package has recognised this in a number of areas. We have already indicated in that policy package that we will abolish the fuel excise, we will abolish payroll tax and we will lower personal income tax in this country, so that people will have more money in their pocket to spend on tourism.

        I want to speak briefly on my own electorate, which also has a very high profile in tourism objectives and a number of very good tourist attractions. Throughout the Bendigo and north-central area of Victoria the objectives of people within the tourism field are to attract interstate and international tourists. Much of that is achieved by a sister city relationship which the city of Bendigo has with Los Altos in the USA and also, through the Bendigo Chinese Association, a relationship with Jiangsu Province in China. Bendigo and the north-central area attract many visitors from both the USA and China.

The golden link links the Central Deborah mine with the talking trams. Bendigo still has a very famous tramway system, which is now used as a tourist facility and destination.

        Firstly, the abolition of fuel excise will improve people's mobility throughout Victoria and Australia and give them the capacity to get to their tourist destinations at a reasonably inexpensive price. Much of the tourism in Australia consists of family groups camping and caravanning throughout the country, reliant upon their own transport to get to destinations.

        As the Minister said, the Government will not just be wishing these jobs and wishing this expansion into existence.

The Minister for Tourism has added that the Opposition's GST proposals would throttle the domestic tourism industry. He points out that Australians holidaying at home would have to pay taxes on meals, entry to attractions, air fares, train and bus tickets and a wide range of services. Of course, the overseas experience has confirmed that the number of bed nights being taken up by overseas visitors has dropped extensively—I believe by 13 per cent—in Sweden following the introduction of a value added tax.

        I would like to address the direction that tourism should take in Australia as we look to the year 2000. In the past, we have tended to rubber stamp other cultures in a bid to attract both Australians and overseas people to our tourist resorts. This transplanting of a mini-Californian scenario, for instance, in some tourist spots in Queensland in the past has indicated two things about our planning: it shows a great short-sightedness, a lack of appreciation of the unique qualities which Australia has to offer; and it shows a lack of confidence in ourselves and a blindness to the uniqueness of our history.

        The potential for attracting visitors through the sensitivity and the history of Aboriginal people and their culture is at last being realised within Australia. One thing that bemuses me is the reaction of some people to the handing back of areas such as Uluru to the traditional owners to manage. Given the mismanagement under our white development techniques, there is a great irony in white Australians feeling concerned that in some way they have lost a piece of Australia and that it will be destroyed and not managed properly.

        Aborigines in north Queensland have been designing art work for T-shirts and other works of art, while others have been performing cultural performances that are enlightening visitors to the vastness of our Australian heritage. It is the type of thing that we should look at. Particularly interesting is Lutheran Pastor Ingarta Peter Bulla, who is 80 years old, white-bearded and drawing tourists into the Northern Territory. With the small Lilla community of which he is Elder, he is developing the vanguard of the Aboriginal tourism industry in the Northern Territory. Visitors to Watarrka National Park at Kings Gorge, west of Alice Springs, hear him tell and sing the complex story of the possum dreaming, during a guided walk through bush beneath the rich red cliffs of the George Gill Range. What casino could compare with this, both as a tourist attraction for local Australians and to draw overseas visitors?

        Ever since Australia adopted the wider New Zealand comb, the number of New Zealand shearers entering Australia to work short term in the industry has been increasing. The fact that in the free trade agreement with New Zealand there is no requirement to acquire visas or work permits has further encouraged New Zealand shearers to take the trip across the Tasman. The fact that New Zealanders who are here for less than six months receive a 100 per cent refund of all income tax paid in Australia on their return home simply encourages them to enter into contracts undercutting award rates of pay. Because the vast majority of these workers are only looking at work in the Australian wool industry as a short term occupation, they are willing to go outside the award system and work under individual contracts. Many woolgrowers have exploited this pool of itinerant workers to avoid paying workers award rates of pay.

The actual number of inspectors in the field is in the range of 100 to 110 at any one time.

Such a model would spell disaster for all Australian workers, especially women and young people in the work force who would suffer significant pay cuts, and would be forced to work longer hours with no penalty rates or other forms of compensation.

        In spite of the Leader of the Opposition's protests to the contrary, the New Zealand model that he wants to impose on the Australian industrial relations system will not result in a fairer system for employers and employees. Rather, it strips those on one side of the relationship, the employees, of all their bargaining power. This is because those opposite are trapped in the same old confrontationist mentality which has held up workplace reform in this country for decades. They are the same tired, old us-and-them arguments that were pushed by Menzies and Fraser and are now being pushed by the Leader of the Opposition. There is no change; these fellows are still living in the 1950s.

        The argument which underlies the Leader of the Opposition's push to abolish the award system and drive down wages is the belief that the way to increase productivity is to reduce wages, which is an absurd, simplistic assumption and absolute nonsense. In turn, this simple-minded assumption is based on the obsession of the hard right wing of the Liberal Party with what it describes as all-powerful unions and greedy workers holding the country to ransom for excessive wage demands. We all know that is a lot of rubbish. When the facts are looked at, it can be seen that these fantasies are without basis and reality. Employees and their representatives have shown remarkable restraint over the past decade, which honourable members on this side of the House acknowledge.

        The focus of the Government's industrial relations policy has been the accord, which has delivered a wages policy that has increased not only productivity but also wages. Contrary to the fairy stories of those opposite about militant unions holding this country to ransom, the number of strikes has now been reduced to an historically low level more than 60 per cent below that when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer and the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), was his chief adviser. All of this has been achieved without stepping away from the push for workplace reform with award restructuring and now workplace bargaining.

        At the same time, employment conditions for workers have been greatly improved with award based superannuation now widespread—with the Opposition, of course, trying to stop it—and a new emphasis on health and safety in the workplace. This, of course, has been the Government's approach, not to indulge in the cheap gimmicks and slogans of the Opposition in an attempt to strip employees of their award conditions. It is not through the wholesale destruction of the centralised system and the protection that it provides Australian workers that we will achieve greater efficiency.

        An abolition of the award system would leave employees open to exploitation never seen before in this country. One need only look at the violations of award conditions currently in place for evidence of what would happen if all awards were abolished in the manner proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We already are facing problems of underpayment by unscrupulous employers seeking to take advantage of the recent economic downturn. What clearly needs to take place is an increased effort in policing employer compliance with award conditions, not the free-fall approach proposed by the Opposition, which it wants to adopt from New Zealand. It is for this reason that this motion is before the House today, and I am pleased to have moved it.

I would like to put this on the record so that when the honourable member for Oxley talks about more interference with employers as they strive to create business and jobs—which Fightback does for them; it is about jobs, jobs, jobs—he recognises that he is seeking a further incursion into the business houses of Australia that will reduce jobs.

       So the Opposition wants to bring in voluntary agreements and downgrade award conditions to the unemployment level—that is what the Opposition is behind. Its argument of the unemployed being the reason employers cannot afford to pay award rates was used in 1910; it was used in the sugar strike in 1911; and it was used at Barcaldine in 1890 when the graziers got a corrupt magistrate and had 600 troopers surround the shearers out there. It has been used in every decade. It does not stand up now, as it did not stand up in any one of those decades. That is the real point.

        When it comes to breaching award conditions, I do not have anything against New Zealand shearers coming over here and competing at an award rate, because we have the CER. What I am against is New Zealanders, as refugees, being forced to run away from the economic policies of the tories of New Zealand. They come over here and are encouraged by graziers and those opposite to break award conditions and to scab.

       This year we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of a series of battles on land and sea which saved Australia from invasion by the Japanese in the dark days of 1942—the Battle of Milne Bay, the Kokoda Trail, the bombing of Darwin and the Battle of the Coral Sea, to mention some, along with the string of merchant ships that were sunk around the Australian coast during World War II. It is also the fiftieth anniversary of the first Japanese sinkings of Australian merchant ships off the east coast of Australia. The first vessel that was sunk, the

        The petition before the House is a result of the persistent efforts of my constituent Mr Bob Nelson OAM of Mount Hutton, his colleagues in the various RSL groups, the RSL itself and, most importantly, former merchant mariners and merchant mariner organisations. Mr Nelson and his colleagues have fought for the rights of Australian merchant mariners and for the need for this Government to recognise the sacrifices and contributions that merchant mariners made for and to Australia's defence and protection during World War II.

        I believe that the time is long overdue to respond with the necessary legislative action to give merchant mariners equal access to the benefits that are now enjoyed—and have been enjoyed for decades—by former defence personnel under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Fifty years after those grim and fearful days of 1942 we as a nation continue today to deny wartime merchant mariners their proper entitlements in respect of disability pensions. In this fiftieth anniversary year of the epic sea and land battles waged in the defence of Australia it is time that merchant mariners, at long last, be given full recognition for their contribution to the defence of our nation. They should be granted the same entitlements as are available to members of the armed forces.

        The reason I am moving for the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 and for access to be given to merchant mariners, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to the same benefits as those enjoyed by ex-service personnel is that the spirit and intent of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act has not been implemented. The McGirr report of October 1989 on page 31 states:

       Let me remind honourable members of the problems faced by merchant mariners in gaining disability pensions from the Commonwealth Government. Merchant mariners are currently covered by the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. Under that Act merchant mariners have to prove that they suffered a war injury during war service, and the onus is on them to prove it. That may be easy if it can be shown that one lost a limb during one's service or under enemy attack; but the fact is that one had to survive.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Although there was enough evidence given to the McGirr inquiry, ship logs recording such injuries were often subsequently lost in action. In many cases records were simply not kept, because of the pressure and conditions under which merchant vessels were operating. Obviously, if ships were sunk later in the war or in a later engagement, no records existed. In many cases the task of having to show that a war injury was suffered has been impossible to complete, owing to records not being kept or lost when ships were damaged or sunk.

        The restrictive nature of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act has meant that fewer than 5 per cent of eligible Australian merchant mariners have been able to gain a disability pension. Let me contrast that with the case of veterans covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. They need only show that they did indeed serve in the regular forces and that a reasonable hypothesis exists to link that service to their illness or disability. The claimant does not have to prove the link.

        The McGirr inquiry found that the range of wartime experiences of Australian merchant mariners was comparable with the experiences of veterans of the Australian defence forces, and in some cases more so. Of this there can be no doubt. It is clear to me from the McGirr report that it was the intention of the government of the day to bring the benefits available under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 into line as far as practicable with the benefits available to ex-servicemen. The then Minister for the Army, Senator McBride, in the Senate at the time concluded:

       It is equally clear that the narrow interpretation placed on the provisions of the Act by the bureaucracy in the intervening years has frustrated the original intent of the legislation, so denying most wartime merchant mariners their proper recognition and entitlements. The McGirr inquiry in October 1989 came to the same conclusion when in paragraph 6.32 it reported:

The remaining step is to repeal the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. On 26 March 1992 the Canadian Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Hon. Gerald S. Merrithew, on behalf of the Canadian Government, stated:

I also support those 1,351 petitioners whose petition was presented to the House this morning by the honourable member for Shortland. It allows us to recognise the comments that have been made, particularly after the World Wars, to the effect that grateful politicians and a grateful public made promises to those who had fought and made sacrifices on the fields of battle to preserve democracy and freedom that we as a community would always support them and their dependants. The promise was made to those people who fought in a war and who fought under the Australian flag. They flew that flag rather proudly in all that they did. It is up to this Parliament to ensure that they and their dependants are looked after in the manner which was originally promised.

Support for this motion comes from every RSL club in Australia; they are thoroughly behind it. Whatever misconceptions people might have had after the Second World War regarding the difference between the merchant navy and the Royal Australian Navy have certainly been lost and at this time we can now recommit ourselves to a joint effort to make sure of their recognition.

        The McGirr inquiry was held in early 1989 and the report was submitted to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) on 13 October 1989. In summary, the report recommended that merchant navy personnel be granted exactly the same rights as other veterans. Yet the Minister has sat on this report since 1989, despite the urgings of all those people throughout Australia. I must confess that two out of the 24 recommendations have been accepted. Those recommendations that have been accepted relate to the extension of a non-taxable lump sum compensation payment of $10,000 for surviving Australian merchant mariners illegally interned in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, and the use of a campaign medals based approach to determine qualifying service for service pension purposes.

        The House must remember that we are dealing with Second World War veterans who are now in their late 60s or early 70s. Having regard to longevity expectations, the 2 1/2 years that have elapsed since the report was presented mean that, for 25 per cent or one-quarter of their expected lifespan from now on, they have been denied the justice which the McGirr report recommended. If one delays justice, one is also denying justice and breaking those solemn promises. Using that analogy, if we sit on the report for another 7 1/2 years, very few veterans will be left to look at an entitlement. We must look at this matter not from the point of view of the cost that will be incurred, but from the point of view that we are adhering to a promise that was made earlier.

        The merchant marine was absolutely essential to the Second World War effort. Their ships became prime targets in port or at sea. It would be fair to say that, as with any other mariners, they were always in a war zone when they were on their vessel. At the commencement of the war those mariners were not allowed to join the other Services. They were ordered back to their ships to provide that essential service. It is said that the casualty rate amongst the merchant marine was as high or higher than that in the armed services.

        He made a submission for an entitlement. It is interesting to note some of the ailments that could be war related but which are refused as grounds for pension—dyspepsia, dizziness, hypertension, osteoarthritis, bilateral sensori-neural deafness and anxiety state. All of these ailments could be defined, in terms of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, as being war related illnesses. The unfortunate part, as was indicated by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), is that the onus of proof required under the current Act is such that if the ship had been sunk and the log books lost then it is up to the individual to prove his eligibility. It is not a matter of entitlement. The real irony is that the report of the Repatriation Commission delegate of 2 February 1990—which Captain Faulkner received; he is a member of the RSL—stated:

I am delighted that the newest Cabinet Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), is at the table. I know that he will listen carefully to the debate today and take our remarks back to his Cabinet colleagues and obtain the necessary support to correct this anomaly.

        Merchant mariners are currently covered by the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act of 1940. Under that Act merchant mariners have to prove that they suffered a war injury during war service. The onus is on them to prove it. As the honourable member for Shortland pointed out, that may be easy if they lost a limb in the course of service or they were under enemy attack. But these people had to survive. Although there was enough evidence given to the McGirr inquiry, ships' logs recording such injuries were often lost in action. Obviously, if a ship was lost later in the course of the war or in a later engagement, no records survived. In many cases the task of having to show that a war injury was suffered has been impossible.

        I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) when he related a personal experience. I too have had people who were in the Merchant Navy come to my office and say that they had been told that, although they were in Darwin when it was being bombed, they had not been in a theatre of war. I have a constituent to whom that has happened. That constituent has been told by the Department that it was not a theatre of war.

        That burden on the individual to prove the injuries makes it difficult for ex-merchant mariners to show that they suffered, for example, lung cancer or other respiratory diseases as a result of wartime service. The restrictive nature of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act has meant that only 3 per cent of eligible Australian merchant mariners have been able to receive a pension.

        The range of wartime experiences of Australian maritime mariners was comparable to the experience of veterans of Australian defence forces; indeed, in some cases, more so. Australian merchant mariners went to sea in ships that were not designed for warfare. They had little or no armour plating. Many of the smaller ships were unarmed. A large merchant ship may have had a crew of around 100. A navy ship of comparable size would have had in excess of 500 persons, including medical staff and facilities. The merchant seamen were constantly exposed to attack by submarines, surface raiders and aircraft at any time, with the added risk of enemy mines laid in coastal waters.

        The number of ships that were sunk has been detailed here today. Those ships were sunk in my own area of Jervis Bay and off the north coast—all around the Australian coastline.

        Many Australians served most of the war years on the dangerous Atlantic run on ships of various nationalities. Those mariners were in particular danger. Enemy raiders were often given specific orders to avoid warships and instead to concentrate their attacks on the carriers of grain, petroleum, munitions and equipment to try to cripple the Allied war effort. Over all, there were about 14,000 Australian merchant mariners engaged during World War II. The McGirr report estimated that 520 lost their lives. This was roughly equivalent to the casualty rate amongst servicemen.

        There seems to me to be no question that World War II Australian merchant mariners should be treated on an equal footing with the veterans of the defence forces. This means equal treatment in benefits and equal access to disability pensions. One point we have to bear in mind is that the future defence potential of this country relies very much on the merchant fleet—on civilians in the defence structure. We need only look at a couple of recent examples. Whatever we may think personally of the Gulf war or the Falklands war, in the Gulf war the United States had to rely on the merchant fleet to get much of its equipment to the Gulf and the United Kingdom would not have been successful in the Falklands had it not had the use of its merchant fleet. It is important to note that all merchant seamen in the Falklands were volunteers.

        Over the past few years much has been said—not least in this House—about Australian shipping. We have seen a restructuring of the seagoing union membership; we have seen crew numbers decrease and concepts such as multi-skilling introduced and a career path for seamen also established. Australian ships today are crewed by well-trained, dedicated personnel. Yet there remains a black mark that only the Government can eradicate, and that is the avoidance of governments to grant to Australian wartime merchant mariners their just entitlements.

I know, as other members of this House know, that he has long had an interest in correcting this injustice, and this is not the first speech that he has made on this topic. I know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is a very caring, sympathetic Minister; I know that he has got the concerns of the veterans community at heart; I know how well respected he is in that veterans community. I know that he would agree with what the speakers have said today, and I am sure he will spare no effort to correct this anomaly—and that is what it is. Those who were prepared to give their lives to defend the lifelines of Australia in the time of war should be able to benefit from the entitlement. There can be no argument against their entitlement to this. I join with my colleagues in urging this Parliament to make sure that that injustice and that anomaly are corrected as soon as possible.

        It would be fair to say that there is continuing unhappiness about the anomaly which is reflected in the motion before us today, particularly in the third part, which calls for the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 and the access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. I make no apology for totally supporting what the honourable member for Shortland had to say and thoroughly endorsing the thrust of that part of the motion.

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         West Australian
        </emphasis>
        on 15 November last year. For the benefit of the House I will just read part of that article, which was headed `Seamen not happy with pension deal'. In part, it said that merchant navy mariners who worked in World War II war zones are angry because of inequities between their disability pensions and those of returned servicemen in the pension changes that were announced that week by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). It went on to say:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       . . . mariners still do not qualify for disability pension unless their injuries can be directly attributable to a hostile attack during the war. All returned servicemen and women are paid the disability pension if they were injured during the war, whether it was during an attack or not. The disability pension, paid in addition to a service pension, is considered compensation for injuries . . . Allied Merchant Seamen Association spokesman, George Hansen, said the 1989 McGirr inquiry into the needs of mariners found evidence which justified repealing the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. Mariners could then be covered under the Veterans Entitlements Act, bringing them into line with returned servicemen.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the context of this very short debate I think it is worth reading into the record some of the historical aspects of that Act. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, seamen's disabilities were covered by the combined effect of the Navigation Act, the Seamen's Compensation Act and awards of the Arbitration Court. Liability for payments associated with the rights conferred under these statutes and awards rested with the shipowners.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The Navigation Act provided for medical treatment and wages. The Seamen's Compensation Act provided workers compensation cover. In line with other compensation schemes, it removed the necessity for seamen to prove negligence on the part of the shipowner before liability could be established. Provision was made for the payment of weekly benefits where an injury resulted in an incapacity for work. It also provided for lump sum payments for specific injuries, reasonable medical expenses, death and funeral benefits. The Act applied to seamen on ships registered in Australia or employed under articles entered into in Australia.

        As a general rule, compensation schemes and insurance agreements contain an exemption from liability for injury or damage caused by an act of God or an act of war. With the outbreak of World War II, additional measures were required to provide coverage for wartime circumstances. Hence we had the genesis of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 which provided for pensions and other benefits, at Commonwealth expense, for masters, officers and seamen employed in Australian merchant ships trading between a port of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth and any other port. It also covered those employed on a lighthouse tender or pilot ships of the Commonwealth or of a State. The benefits in that legislation were available to these mariners if, while employed in their normal course of duty, they sustained a war injury resulting in death or incapacity, or were captured and detained by the enemy, or their effects were lost or damaged as a result of enemy action. The Act also provided for pensions for dependants under certain circumstances.

        The Act was amended through the medium of several other pieces of legislation through 1942 and 1943, and in December 1943 the War Cabinet authorised a grant of education benefits on the same lines as those available under the repatriation children's education scheme. The National Security (Wages of Seamen Detained by the Enemy) Regulations and the National Security (Additional Pensions and Allowances) Regulations expired in 1946. All claims for detention allowances and compensation for loss of effects, which were dealt with by the Department of Shipping and Transport, were disposed of within five years of the end of the war. The relevant sections of the National Security Act were repealed in 1952.

        I do not have to tell the Minister, but in general the amendments made to this Act after World War II have aligned the pension benefits available to Australian merchant mariners with changes made to the repatriation legislation, even if in the early stages there were some delays in making amendments to that Act. In recent years, however, because the Act adopts some provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act—in particular, the criteria for assessment of rates of pension—changes to the earlier Act have been made at the same time as the changes to the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

        I add a few comments to what my colleagues the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) had to say. Here we have a piece of legislation that, unless it is repealed and unless the benefits are extended under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, will still create injustices. To put it in the Australian vernacular, we will not be giving a disadvantaged group a fair go.

        I think it is unfortunate if it is just with the passing of time that a problem tends to go away. I formally congratulate the Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on his elevation into the Cabinet. I think that he has shown himself to be a compassionate Minister, and he communicates well with the veterans community. I wish him well in that continuing capacity and in his added responsibilities within the Cabinet, but I would remind him of a section within the McGirr report—I refer specifically to section 6.29—which says:

       Inevitably, there is likely to be some time lag between the report of the inquiry being presented and considered, and action taken to implement the recommendations through legislative change. If there were to be an undue delay, the full intent of the report might be lost or the recommendations substantially modified between the time the decision is taken and the changes implemented.
      </para>
      <para>
       So I simply say to the Minister that I totally support what the honourable member for Dawson said, that we need a thorough review of the McGirr report. Hopefully, as a result of that review, the Minister and the Government will see their way clear to make it up to a very disadvantaged group, albeit a relatively small group, for the disadvantages that they presently enjoy, if that is the right word. I hope that in Cabinet he will be pushing the necessary repeal of these provisions and the increased access to all the benefits that many others enjoy, and rightfully so, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.

        For the purpose of this debate, I wish to talk about Australian children and youth, the most unrepresented minority in our nation and a minority that makes up 20 per cent of our population.

        This nation can rightly be proud of its increasing tolerance towards minority groups. As we all too well know, that was not always the case. Many commentators suspect that Australia is in fact now more tolerant than, say, Great Britain or the United States of America. Yet in Australia, as in nearly all other nations, there is a very significant minority group that too often is overlooked and devalued. That significant minority is our children and our youth. No-one would dispute the statement that a civilised society is one that cares for its young and its aged.

        Civilisation is a concept that means far more than good taste, a courteous manner and children being seen and not heard. To civilise means to improve, to regenerate, to provide a good influence, to enrich, to enhance and to progress. It involves a process of consciousness raising and the acquisition of more sophisticated thinking towards enlightenment. With children and youth we are talking about the basic building blocks of our society. It ought to be fundamental that we enable at every opportunity those same children and our youth to mature, to ascend to greater heights, to graduate to their potential, so that the whole nation benefits by their socialisation, their skills and their talents by the processes of renewal, the infusion of new blood and the impetus of new ideas—the very basic prerequisites for any worthwhile change.

        But why is it, when changes are mooted, that seldom, if ever, does the debate begin by considering the basic building block of our society, that of our children? Who represents children? Can anyone in this House name the powerful body or bodies in this nation that include children and youth? Now, of course, I acknowledge that specific groups, for example, those representing isolated children, homeless children, gifted children, disabled children and so on, have State and national organisations.

        My contention is that children and youth are not directly represented by anyone and, if they are lucky enough to get a mention, it is more often as a secondary consideration. On a national, political basis, child-care is in the portfolio of Health, Housing and Community Services. Schooling is in Employment, Education and Training. Other relevant aspects involving children and youth are in the ministries of Social Security; Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

        More often than not, issues affecting children and youth are subsumed by those portfolios. From a national perspective, there appears to me to be a lack of coordination. An examination of the institutions that impact upon children and youth is enlightening. It could be argued quite plausibly that child-care in this country could be more accurately described as parent respite. The prime factor and driving force that established what we call child-care were not necessarily the caring of children; they were, in fact, parent respite. The intention was to allow parents of children to participate in employment and/or activities to relieve the constant demand of parenting.

        There is nothing whatsoever intrinsically wrong with parent respite. It makes both economic and social sense. But to describe child-care centres as we do fails to acknowledge how they came about. As an insight into child-care in this country, interested people could do well to note the remuneration, qualifications and conditions as they apply to child-care workers.

        Take, for example, the second institution that impacts upon children and youth, that of schools. Schooling of young children from as early as five to seven years of age will largely determine the basic literacy and numeracy skills of our future generation. Schooling of young children from the ages of seven to 11 will be the most significant determinant of their future success and is far more significant than socioeconomic status, ethnic background or gender. Yet schooling, at these levels, compared with other sectors of education, is very poorly resourced. We know that, for about 20 per cent of our children, schooling is not always successful and, rather than opting for cheaper, more effective preventative measures, we too often apply expensive, ineffectual, fix-it programs.

        As our society discriminated against women by its use of language, and as it still does against the aged, so it discriminates against children and youth. Most language that refers to adults, to employed adults that is, is positive. The phrases used include `prime of life', `reached majority age', `years of discretion', and so on. Little in our language is negative against adults. I can think of only two phrases, `middle aged spread', which a few of us have got, and, in more recent years, `midlife crisis'.

        Whilst certainly our everyday language refers to positive aspects of our aged—`grandmother', `grandfather', `sage', and `venerable'—we must also be aware of the considerable negatives which describe the aged in everyday language. These descriptions include `old codger', `silly old geezer', or worse, `old fogy', `old hag', `no spring chicken', `long in the tooth', `old crony', and in their declining years, `moribund', `wrinklies', `decrepit', and `senile'.

But when we consider negative descriptions of our children and youth, the list is appallingly long. To heighten our awareness, try calling our spouse or our friends some of these everyday references to children and youth and see how we get on. They include `juvenile', `infantile', `childish', `immature', `babyish', `little minx', `little wench', `junior', `nothing but a green, callow and awkward youth', `underage', `brat', `yob', `baggage', and, of course, `in your minority years'.

For secondary schools, this Government has also provided national leadership in improving retention rates.

        Who goes into bat for Australia's children and youth—a group, of course, which does not have, as do all others, the opportunity of the ballot-box? The naming of a national group is particularly difficult. Who are the agents acting on behalf of all children, lobbying and impacting effectively upon both the Federal Government and the Opposition? I contend that it is none of the following. It is not State governments of any persuasion. It is not the media. It is not universities, TAFEs, secondary schools or their associated groups. It is not child-care organisations. It is not the teaching profession or its unions. It is not parent bodies. It is not education bureaucrats. It is not business or trade unions.

        The need to address children and youth affairs on a national basis was recognised in 1975. The arguments put forward then were correct. They remain correct today, and it is time they were acted upon. The creation of a ministry for children and youth affairs will be focused to meet the needs of our largest minority group. The creation of this ministry could provide the necessary impetus to coordinate and integrate existing child and youth groups on a national basis. This idea is working for women.

However, this ministry could go a long way towards better civilising our current and future society. This ministry could also go a long way towards combating one of the last major areas of discrimination that affects a very significant group of Australians.

        To a very great extent those of us who spawned the current generation of children view family life and the activities of our youth through mirrored spectacles, reflecting our own memories of a society now changed to the very stark reality of today. For a very long time society in Australia has been based on the family as the basic core—the basic unit. But very rapid change in the past two decades has wrought a society which is very different from that of the 1950s and 1960s.

That report could only estimate the level of homeless youth as being between 25,000 and 70,000, with at least 8,500 aged between 12 and 15.

We have made education—at least to year 12—uniformly available to all youth, but we have not yet created a training system to adequately service the needs of some 70 per cent of our young people who will not complete secondary schooling or attend university.

        Increasing crime, increasing drug use, increasing dependence on alcohol and increasing dislocation through all of society generate major stress which impacts on the family unit and therefore impacts on our youth. I believe that the stresses set up in many aspects of life today in Australia—and probably throughout the world in general—lead some portion of our youth to a real sense of helplessness. Alcoholics in AA freely talk about their sense of absolute helplessness and their lack of ability to control their own lives, regardless of the situation around them and regardless of support mechanisms put in place to help them.

        For all of these reasons, I believe that it is imperative that we create a small, active, mobile, effective and powerful ministry for children and youth affairs which has Cabinet clout to coordinate issues affecting youth across a range of portfolios.

        Almost all those active today in youth affairs at a local and knowledgeable level call for expenditure of funds to be directed to the voluntary welfare organisations and charities which work at a real grassroots level with our people, and most particularly with our children. It is the private sector, which is both highly motivated and client oriented, that will in my view, at the end of the day, deliver the goods. It is not another expensive Canberra bureaucracy that I support or that I would wish to create but a small and powerful coordinating body that might reduce the size of other bureaucracies to allow us to more effectively deliver taxpayer funds in areas which may help us solve our problems with youth and help us reverse a most frightening trend towards youth homelessness and helplessness.

        —It is a pleasure to second the motion that has been put forward this afternoon by my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). I also thank the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for his contribution to the debate this afternoon. The notion of a ministry of children and youth affairs is not a unique one; it has come before the House on a previous occasion, many years ago I believe. The honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to children as being the basic building blocks of our society and nothing could be truer than that comment. The way we support the maturation of those building blocks and the development of the building blocks is what this ministry is all about.

        The honourable member for La Trobe passed comments about the difficulties that the family faces in staying together in this changing society today: the potential conflicts between the different departments and the different forces at work that impact upon the family. He recognises, and I agree with him, that the family is a unit which does need support. Certainly, a department which could coordinate the delivery of services and oversee the impact of the initiatives that government has put in place would ensure true support for youth and children as a powerless group in our society. Children are a minority group. They do not have a direct voice in any ministerial or Cabinet discussions. The notion that they have been within a family or do not have a vote and, therefore, do not require to be represented within our Parliament, I think, is wrong.

        We have many other minority groups within society which do have a direct representative in the Ministry to take care of their needs. That transcends all other ages of society, all other stages of the economy and participants. Certainly one aspect of a ministry is to protect and ensure that they benefit fully from the role of government. At this stage within Australia's development, when we are debating the Constitution and other aspects of our society and our parliamentary institutions and how they should function through the twenty-first century, it is certainly appropriate that we take this on board, and I would recommend any government to institute what we are asking for today.

        We could talk at length about the way television and the newspapers actually portray youth. There have been many examples of the emotive claptrap that they go on with in selling stories to the public that impacts adversely upon youth. The ministry would be able to supply support for the family and other institutions like our educational institutions which do positively develop our children and our youth. It is along these lines that the ministry would be functioning.

        There are probably, as I mentioned, any number of examples of the negative impact, but what we have to realise is that youth is the stage at which people are developing their own intellectual and emotional values. We need to support this process, and we do not need to have those natural inclinations of youth being portrayed as something negative or something that any other sections of society have to fear. The recognition that a ministry would give youth is very timely and I recommend the motion to the House.

        However, I do support the principle put forward by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). In doing so, I am not necessarily wedded to the idea of a ministry of children and youth affairs; it is possible that the objective could be met in a couple of other ways. I suggest there could be an Office for Youth Affairs, a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs, or something of that nature.

        Nevertheless, the principle is very important. The honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to the Office of the Status of Women, and that is one reference that I was going to make. It has been very successful in relation to raising awareness of women's issues, and I could see an Office of Youth Affairs or some such organisation performing the same sort of function. It would be in touch with the affected age group, either working through groups that are presently in touch with the age group or making structures of its own to make sure that it was in touch with the affected age group. That is important, because this is a very difficult group to have contact with, as all members of parliament would be aware. Such an ofice  would provide an overview of issues, as against separate departmental views. It would be able to look at proposals of all departments and bring to bear a particular expertise on the effect of policies that are in place or of proposed policies. It could also perform an educative function, educative both out to the public and within government ranks.

        I want to touch quickly on a couple of other things. Education has been mentioned, and this is an issue about which I feel very strongly. I think that at present our education system is not relevant, it is inflexible and the post-secondary provisions are too restrictive. Those issues need to be urgently addressed. I think they have a lot to answer for with respect to youth unemployment at the moment. We all read, I am sure, with great sadness in today's newspaper that there are now 680,000 children in this country who have neither parent working and that 500 more are added to that list every day. What are these young people learning about life, what effect is it having on their hopes for the future? The subject of homelessness is a very dramatic one. It is one that I see every day in my electorate, and the issue of juvenile crime is one that impinges on all of us.

         But do honourable members know why they do not? Because they are scared, and they are scared because the one key element of this package is that it is fair. It is a fair package and it provides fairness for the Australian people. But they are scared of fairness; they are scared of it because they want to get the front running on fairness. It is a mockery of this so-called social justice policy of the ALP.

         There are some other issues of importance to the electors of Brisbane which I wish to raise in the House today. A couple of weeks ago the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) visited the Stubbies clothing factory in the electorate of Brisbane. Whilst there he lamented with crocodile tears the loss of jobs in that industry due in no small way to the tariff reductions and the restructuring which is going on in the textiles, clothing and footwear areas.

         I have had a very close and detailed involvement with the TCF industries in south-east Queensland, and particularly with Stubbies. I am well aware of the difficulties they have confronted over recent years and I have made a number of speeches in this place about them. I might say that whilst tariffs are a major concern to the industry, there are a number of other practices within the industry, fostered and cultivated by the sorts of industrial relations policies that are in the Fightback package, which make the industry less viable than it should be.

         During his visit and amidst his crocodile tears, the honourable member for Bennelong demonstrated both his and the Liberal's view of this industry—one which does them little credit. The industry is not fooled by the sorts of charades that were undertaken a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane. It knows that the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong are wolves in sheep's clothing. Did the honourable member for Bennelong tell the workers at Stubbies and the people concerned about the TCF industry that his policy—the Liberal Party policy—will not reduce but will eliminate all tariffs and quotas on TCF?

They want the rate of reduction to be increased. I am indebted to Queensland Liberal Senator MacGibbon who, in the other place on 12 December 1990, said:

Did he tell them the Opposition's policy was to cut funding to the CES offices and to end the Labor Government's special assistance programs for TCF workers who lose their jobs by cutting, as a Liberal Government would, the TCF labour adjustment package? That package is a special program created by this Government to assist those workers who have lost their jobs in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. That program would be abolished under Liberal policy. Did he tell them of the Liberal proposals to discontinue unemployment benefits for those out of work for more than nine months? Did he tell them of the Liberal proposals to abolish the Labor Government's export subsidy for TCF, another program we have established to support that industry.

        The honourable member for Mayo attacked the Labor Government because it is offering the textile and clothing industries export subsidies to assist them. To make matters worse, in the very next paragraph of that press release the honourable member said:

I would have thought the shadow spokesperson for trade and trade negotiations would have placed a higher priority on the need to facilitate the exports of Australian textiles, but that was not the case.

         On 1 April this year the honourable member for Barker attacked the Government over its policy of maintaining some protection for certain industries, including TCF. In fact, in that matter of public importance debate the TCF industries were particularly singled out. Having witnessed the sort of mock concern of the honourable member for Bennelong and the Liberals to the plight of workers at Stubbies, it seems clear that those actions were little more than a sick April Fools' Day joke. Indeed, the MPI submitted by the honourable member for Barker was moved on 1 April.

It seems as though the Opposition has got a different story to tell depending on who is in the audience. When the honourable members of the Opposition are with their mates in industry they talk tough about cutting tariffs; they talk tough about the need to be internationally competitive in a whole range of areas. However, when they go to the shop floor and talk to the workers in the factories they bemoan the fact that there have been job losses, but they fail to tell the workers that the Opposition's policies would not only have caused the same job losses, but would in fact have created additional job losses.

         Perhaps the last word on the Opposition's view of protection for the TCF industries is best summed up by Queensland Liberal Senator MacGibbon. Senator MacGibbon said in the Senate on 14 November last year:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is putting money into the TCFDA—the textile, clothing and footwear group. What a waste of money that is on a bloated group which, even today, enjoys an effective tariff protection of up to 250 per cent on some articles. It is putting money into the ABC of all things; and the AIDC. But none of this deals with Australia's structural problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator MacGibbon went out of his way to attack the assistance the Government is giving to the textile clothing workers. That is what he said in November last year, and yet two weeks ago the honourable member for Bennelong paraded himself before those same people whom Senator MacGibbon attacked as being `a bloated group' which does not deserve the protection that the Government is now affording it. I wonder whether the honourable member for Bennelong told the workers at Stubbies that that was the view of a Queensland Liberal senator, a senator from the State in which they worked. I would hazard a good guess that he did not.

         When the Liberal Party has removed all the protection for TCF industries, when it has caused more workers to lose their jobs and then removed the special retraining programs that this Government has set in place, along with the opportunity for long term unemployed to get some social security, what policy is the Liberal Party going to offer to the workers who are left in the TCF industries? I think the answer to that is the newly found, honourable member for Bennelong led, big bang industrial relations policy.

         What those workers that are left in the TCF industry will get, like all other workers, is lower wages, no right to union representation, as witnessed by the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the current Burnie pulp and paper mill dispute, no right to have industrial disputes arbitrated, no right of access to an independent umpire to settle disputes, no right to holiday leave pay, no right to standard hours, no right to maternity leave, no right to long service leave and no right to overtime rates. All of those things are part and parcel of the Fightback industrial relations policy. The Opposition should be honest in its presentation of these things to the workers at Stubbies and in the TCF industries in general.

In spite of all of its problems, it still has an awful lot going for it and has more people trying to get into it than get out of it.

         This morning, I do not want to be in any sense dismissive of the problems the nation faces. I want to put it to the House that the problems we face are anything but insoluble, but the difficulty we have is that recent history would indicate to us that we are heading 180 degrees in the wrong direction. The things that are growing in Australia right now are our dole queues and our debt, and the thing that is shrinking is our standard of living. Something needs to be done to turn that around so that it is the dole queues and the debt that shrink and the standard of living that expands. It is a matter of sobering reality to every politician that in the time that this grievance debate will take, a little over an hour, 25 Australians will find themselves unemployed. And the tragedy there is that, as we have witnessed in Question Time day after day in this place and as we will in all probability witness again at 2 o'clock this afternoon, the Prime Minister, far from recognising any responsibility for what happens, merely washes his hands and wants to suggest that everything that the Opposition proposes as an alternative course should be dismissed out of hand.

Mark Twain said, `When in doubt tell the truth. It will confound your enemies and astound your friends'. It is to the great credit of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that he has suggested it is time that an Opposition laid down a detailed package that said to the people of Australia, `There is an alternative, and this is what it is about'. He has told the truth: it has confounded our enemies and astounded our friends. Tragically, for all the detail that has been given, for all the indication as to which taxes would be abandoned and the way in which a GST would be put in the place of those taxes, and for all the detail indicating that abandoning seven taxes reduces the incoming Treasury's income by $35 billion and generates only $27 billion to replace it, all we have had from honourable members opposite has been scorn and derision about this alternative.

         —I do not think I have had the pleasure of seeing you in the chair for a while, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is nice to see you there again. I wish to discuss the national day of action on unemployment and the fact that on 12 May many members of parliament had the pleasure, and sometimes perhaps not such a pleasure, of having people from the community visit their electorate offices to discuss what they were doing as individuals and as members of either the Government or the Opposition for employment in their region.

         I was very pleased to welcome people from my electorate on that day in my electorate office. The majority of the people in the delegation were members of the Anglican Church and were active people in the community in the provision of welfare, emergency relief, youth work and congregational activities. It was a very meaningful discussion that we held and I am sure that other members, my colleagues and those on the Opposition side, would have had similar discussions, hopefully as good as the one that I had. But it remains a fact that unemployment is a problem in Australia and in many of our electorates there are a large number of people who are without work. I believe that the national day of action was a meaningful strategy to try to draw the attention of members of parliament, including members of the Government, to the problems these people are suffering from.

         Nobody in this House, I am sure, takes unemployment for granted; all would want to do the very best that they could to assist people into jobs, but as individuals it is obviously difficult for any of us to do so. Nevertheless, as a group of people we have great ability to affect at least some of the outcomes that people have in terms of employment and their prospects for obtaining work or training—particularly in this case, work.

         Honourable members would also know that the National Skillshare Association wrote to members of parliament to draw their attention to the national day of action and to give its support to that national day of action. Some people may object to that occurring, given that it is a government funded organisation. I for one do not. I think it is part of its job, as long as it is not politically partisan, which it patently is not, to draw our attention as members of parliament to these sorts of strategies which are going on in the community and which in fact have not been started by it but are simply being endorsed by it.

         One of the comments that were made in the Skillshare letter to members of parliament recognised the importance of the priorities that have been laid down for the national day. These priorities, as honourable members will probably be aware, were threefold. The first was that job growth must be the first priority of economic policy and this commitment to jobs must be sustained over time. The second was that employment and training programs for unemployed people should be expanded and improved, and the third was that income support arrangements for unemployed people should also be improved. I am sure there would be nobody in the House who would have an argument with any of those priorities. I certainly do not myself, but I do have a concern that there may be more that we could be doing as a government on the question of identifying specific regions of need.

         One of the points that was made to me by Bishop Brian Kyme, who happened to be one of the people who came to my office, was that it would be a good opportunity for the Federal Government to have a look at regional unemployment, or unemployment in specific disadvantaged areas. He suggested unemployment strategies to try to create better opportunities for people in specific areas of need. By way of example he mentioned the disadvantaged schools program where a specific allocation of funds is made to schools that have a large number of low income people within their catchment area.

         Today I wish to urge the Minister and all those who are in a position to make these decisions—and obviously I am not avoiding my own responsibilities in this area—to give further serious and sympathetic consideration to expanding our involvement in the creation of jobs in specific areas. I would emphasise in this context the role of the Minister and his Department in assisting me in achieving a job program involving BP service stations. The stations have begun training approximately 15 people for one year in driveway activities at service stations.

         This has actually been quite an important project which began in Western Australia and was launched by the Minister last Friday. I think it actually has the potential to do some good if it is copied by other groups of people in the community. It enables an individual to work with employers to create jobs for people who need them. The jobs cannot simply be for youth or for older people. The schemes must be able to deal with the special problems of a particular region or a particular locality.

         Obviously there are local employment strategies—I am not saying there are not—but I put the suggestion to the Parliament as a way of reducing unemployment. The stimulus given to the economy by the One Nation package is working, but that involves larger employment strategies such as infrastructure projects. I think that local, small employment strategies should also be pursued, and perhaps in a more coordinated way than is currently occurring.

         I think that the Minister is doing an excellent job in fulfilling his responsibilities to the Australian population but unless we draw some of these more local problems to his attention it is difficult for him to know that this is what is happening on a local basis. I know that he is particularly interested in his own electorate, as many of us are, and is aware of what is going on there. I will be raising this in the Caucus committee and hope that we will be able to discover better ways of being able to achieve the sort of job growth that is required at the local level so that we can help all of the people in those electorates which are particularly hurt by unemployment.

         My own electorate has a number of suburbs which are hard hit, and have been hard hit for a number of years. They include Girrawheen, Koondoola, Marangaroo, Balga, and Ballajura. Those areas in particular I would say would have very high unemployment rates and they would not be dissimilar to some other outer suburban areas in other capital cities where there is very little job growth but quite a lot of people residing there whose families either have a history of not being employed, or where the children themselves look as if they are not going to be able to get jobs.

The national day of action on unemployment is to be applauded, I believe, as is the interest of all of the community groups and individuals involved in it. I am sure that other members of this House would join with me in congratulating those people who took the time to come and involve themselves with the members of parliament to discuss matters of great urgency and great import to their local communities. I certainly welcomed my group of people and know that others in this House will have done so also.

         —My grievance today is with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) for having the blatant hypocrisy to steamroll through this Parliament the Construction Industry Reform Bill, which created the Construction Industry Reform Authority, knowing full well the substantive issues and recommendations to be raised by Roger Gyles QC in his report as Royal Commissioner inquiring into productivity in the construction industry in New South Wales.

         The Minister knew full well that the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Master Builders Association of New South Wales were due to be massively condemned by Commissioner Gyles. Nonetheless, the Minister proceeded with major legislation designed to reform the industry in Australia with the major players in the Construction Industry Reform Authority being the selfsame BWIU and MBA.

         Commissioner Gyles's sweeping condemnation of the industrial relations system now prevailing in the building and construction industry in New South Wales contrasts starkly with the industrial peace, efficiency and high productivity of the home building industry throughout our country. There is no possible justification for the Minister and the Government foisting on the Australian people and the major construction industry a bureaucratic reform mechanism driven by the club which has been so demonstrably condemned by the Gyles report. The issue does not end with the Construction Industry Reform Authority because this Government is determined to destroy the home building industry through the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. That Bill, which gives the Industrial Relations Commission power to regulate contracts and independent contractors, will effectively bring to the home building industry the very industrial relations system and industry practices so roundly criticised by Commissioner Gyles.

This Government seems intent on entrenching in legislation and agreement world-worst practice throughout building and construction in Australia. Commissioner Gyles said:

         All Australians pay for our major construction industry, regardless of the cost and regardless of the location. Whether or not we are efficient is a moot point—when it comes to the construction of a school, a hospital, a church, an office building or a major industrial complex—because it is true that we cannot build these facilities and export them for resale overseas. In a very real sense, all of us pay for any inefficiencies in building construction. Any rorts, any anarchy, any corruption, any reduced effort, any blatantly indefensible wages or conditions of employment, and any industry abuse of what would otherwise be sensible safety regulations, add to the costs of construction, for which we all pay, through taxes or charges for goods and services.

         Because of the no ticket, no start agreements, and because of compulsory union membership and compulsory membership of management associations, the building industry club forms and perpetuates one of the greatest, most significant, cartels in Australia. If allowed to continue unchecked, the building industry cartel between owners, builders and the unions will continue to surpass even the waterfront and public transport industries in our country, in terms of inefficiencies. Commissioner Gyles said, and again I quote:

       <para>
        There is no question but that Commissioner Gyles is correct. In 1990 I introduced into this House a private member's Bill entitled Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill 1990. That private member's Bill was designed to ensure the end of compulsory union membership, the end of compulsory membership of associations such as the MBA, and the end of compulsory association membership by solicitors and accountants. Our country is a bastion of freedoms and rights. We talk about women's rights, children's rights, Aboriginal rights, animals' rights and rights for the disadvantaged but rarely—very rarely—in this day and age, do we talk about responsibilities.

         Commissioner Gyles has made it clear that unions and company managements, in concert in New South Wales, have ignored the rights of their constituency, which is the public purse and the people of New South Wales. The rorts, inefficiencies, illegalities, standover tactics and industrial nonsenses described in his report are to the cost of every individual citizen in New South Wales. It is truly past time that all individuals who work in, or control, or pay for, building construction take account of their responsibilities towards their fellow Australians. It is time to deregulate the labour market and let those who will lead the way with real innovative reform.

          A report into the representation of young people in the New South Wales print media
         </emphasis>
         , by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism from the University of Technology, Sydney, was published in March this year. Its summary, let alone its contents, should concern every thinking Australian, but it should particularly concern every parliamentarian in this nation.

         The report made a number of points that I want to quote from its summary. It says that newspapers and magazines have a proportionally low representation of young people—one would think that that is not particularly good strategy to encourage more and future readers—and that newspapers and magazines offer limited and negative information about young people. The report says that linguistic bias is prevalent—the words `youth charged', for example, connotes an intrinsically troublesome male. Topical bias is prevalent: young people in criminal activity account for the major proportion of media coverage, and crime reports can be around 40 to 50 per cent  of the total coverage.

         The report goes on to say that thematic bias is prevalent, with the problems of young people being given emphasis and, again, coverage of 40 to 50 per cent is not uncommon. It says that image stereotyping predominates, for example, that today's youth is a confused group. The voice of young people is noticeably absent, while the achievements of young people are frequently patronised, trivialised or ignored, such as the cute photo opportunity with an often meaningless story—some honourable members in this House get stories like that too.

         I will take the week before Easter as an example. I have ignored the Saturday sports edition and business section and have simply referred to the main body of the paper. In total, over four days, 24 articles applied to children and youth but only four themes were involved and were carried on for the whole week. Children's problems accounted for 14 articles, 13 of which focused on problems and one was positive. Six articles were on youth crime. Four articles were on what could only be described as pretty trivial, although one could be argued as being positive. In other words, 55 per cent of the articles focused on problems of childhood and youth, 25 per cent referred to youth crime, 16 per cent to trivial issues, and 4 per cent of the articles were positive, in fact dealing with a problem but at least written in a positive sense.

Thus, 57 per cent were on crime, 35 per cent on problems and 7 per cent on a positive article. So over the two weeks, 45 per cent of the articles dealt with problems, 41 per cent with crime, 8 per cent with trivia and 6 per cent were positive.

         Unintended as it is, there is a message of sorts to our children and youth. That is, in 94 cases out of 100, if you are a child or a youth and you want to be acknowledged by the media in Adelaide, have a problem, get involved in a crime or be cute and pose for a trivial story of some sort. I am not arguing that these stories should not be told. What I am arguing is that they ought to be balanced with the achievements of children and youth. About 6 per cent of the child and youth population in South Australia received about 94 per cent of the coverage in the Adelaide

         It is therefore not difficult to say, nor can it be challenged, that the print media, one of the most powerful agents in our society, is susceptible to portraying children and youth continually in a negative light. Often reporters simply describe events. Sometimes it appears the more negative the story, the better. But seldom, if ever, do many stories point the way to solutions or causes. You could be forgiven for thinking that they operate—and, even more so, their subeditors who create the headlines—on the lowest possible common denominator. There appears to be a total absence of any rationale. Because that is so, they cannot possibly identify or even acknowledge any solutions or processes to implement, to improve the status quo. It is an old saying: if you do not know why you are doing something, if you do not know what or how you are doing it, you will more than likely end up somewhere else and the real pity is, you will not even realise it.

At this time, that response has not been received. However, to be fair to the Adelaide

        Even though he wrote that in the seventeenth century, it really is very appropriate to this wonderful country of ours today—Australia—because our nation is grieving and our nation is suffering.

         In this grievance debate I am grieving for the people and the Parliament of Australia. I am grieving for the Parliament because of what I believe is a distinct decline in the standards of the conduct of this place. I believe this started with the advent of the Hawke-Keating Government in 1983 when a major change occurred. Up until then, the Government of the day and the Opposition of the day, whoever they may have been, would get on with the jobs of governing and opposing. When the election came, they would go at it hammer and tongs, boots and all, and that is fair enough. But in 1983 a Labor government was elected. That Government has not got on with the job of governing. It has been preoccupied not with playing the ball, but with playing the man. Its major preoccupation since 1983 has been fighting and attacking the Opposition.

         Frankly, I believe the people of Australia have had a gutful of that. They are fed up with it. What they want from the honourable members in Parliament is for us to start being, perhaps, a little more polite to each other. They want us to get on with the job and not waste time just attacking each other. Of course, what happened with the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) while he was Treasurer was that he made abuse into an art form, although I note that since he has assumed the mantle of dignity of being Prime Minister his vocabulary has improved quite a bit. In fact, I have not heard one mention of `scumbag' this year, which is a very notable change.

         Question Time, of course, is very much misunderstood by the people of Australia because it is so vigorous and so absolutely volatile, but there is a good reason for that. Honourable members of the Opposition have 30 seconds—maybe 45 seconds—in which to ask a question which a Minister can take 25 minutes on occasions to not answer and to make the most outrageous claims and tell the most deliberate untruths. Of course, if we sit here quietly, we let it go and that makes it fact, so we cannot allow that to happen. So a vigorous response is essential during Question Time. Leaving that aside, I repeat that what the people of Australia want is for those on the government benches to get on with the job of governing and for those in opposition to get on with the job of opposing responsibly.

         I also grieve for the million, at least, of my fellow Australians who are unemployed. I do not think there is any doubt that most of them do want to work. I know it was popular in years gone by to talk about `dole bludgers', and probably there are still people who would not work in an iron lung, but the vast majority of our fellow Australians who are unemployed do want a job. They want to work, and they want the dignity and self-respect, as well as the money, that comes with a job.

         The situation is getting much worse. The announcement was made today that 306,500 of our fellow Australians have been unemployed for longer than one year. That is up 80,000 since last November and that is a really terrifying figure. The average time for all people unemployed now is more than 48 weeks—compare that with only 38 weeks a year ago—and it is getting worse. Men in the group aged between 35 to 54 are now spending an average of 62 weeks unemployed. That is not good enough. It is not good enough for those men, and indeed the women too, in that age group who are now unemployed for an average of 57 weeks or more. It is not good enough at all. The honourable members of this Parliament have a responsibility to make a change. I believe that the Opposition has the plan and the vision to make that change.

         Before leaving the topic of unemployment, I note that the unemployment rate for the immigrants who arrived last year from the Middle East and North Africa is 72.6 per cent. The rate was not as bad for South East Asian arrivals last year. Their unemployment rate was 41.8 per cent. I am pleased to say that that is down 10 per cent on the figure of last November. Somebody—perhaps one of the professional ethnics—will probably jump up and down and accuse me of being racist or prejudiced, but because of that figure, and in the interests of fair and open debate we, as Australian citizens, no matter what our origin, must look at our immigration program. I believe it is not in the national interest to import unemployment. We cannot afford to do so.

         I am also very concerned about youth unemployment. I grieve for the one-third of our teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 who cannot get a job and I grieve at the fact that in this country of ours there are 262,000 families where the chief breadwinner does not have a job. There are 218,000 Australian kids in families where no-one has a job and, quite frankly, there is not much prospect of their getting a job. In spite of that famous statement of a few years ago, we have still got 500,000 kids living in poverty. I grieve in this grievance debate because the men and the women sitting opposite on the Government benches are well meaning, I give full credit to their good intentions and their desire to do the right thing for Australia, but regrettably they are blinkered by prejudice and unfortunately they are blinded by self-interest, following their Prime Minister, who will say anything and do anything to cling desperately to power.

         I grieve most definitely at the attitude of the Government, which is endlessly lying about the contents of the Fightback package, a package which I believe will provide the economic salvation of Australia. Honourable members opposite constantly say that, because of the goods and service tax component of the Fightback package, everything we put in our mouths and everything that we put on our backs will cost an extra 15 per cent. They all know that that is not true, it is not correct. We are abolishing seven taxes and we are replacing seven taxes with the GST, which is a 15 per cent tax. But after you have abolished the other seven taxes, even the Government's own figures, produced by the Treasury, suggest that the one-off increase will only be 3.6 per cent. We believe by our figuring that it will be 4.4 per cent, but we have taken a conservative approach all the way through. Even the Government says it is only going to be 3.6 per cent, on the Treasury figures themselves.

         So I appeal to those righteous members of the Government to think a little before blindly following the line of not telling the truth. We know what is in One Nation and, quite frankly, it is up to the people of Australia to make their decision without my trying to pervert what is in it or distort it; they can do that. I would just ask that members of the Government might reciprocate and let people make up their own minds about Fightback. We are concerned with the future of our kids, and we are concerned with the security of our fellow Australians in terms of a job and finance and even personal security.

         —I speak after the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who on 2 April raised the same matter that I raise today in this debate, the question of the importation of second-hand motor engines. One of the great dogmas that has obsessed Australia in the 1980s, along with the total deregulation of all markets and how we are going to fare fantastically ever afterwards if we deregulate banking, has been tariff reductions. Despite our international insignificance, we are apparently going to succeed in persuading the world to move in similar directions, at the same time ignoring the reality of quite stark barriers to our imports. One of the areas that has been raised by employers with me is this very area of second-hand car motor importation.

         In 1988 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) lectured the industry on what he perceived as the realities of the industry. He said that they were all wrong and really it had nothing to do with importations, it was just a matter of the changing nature of the market and their own incompetence, et cetera. He stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am not convinced that the reduction in tariff assistance will, as Mr Robinson suggests, lead to an increase in imports and a consequent decrease in activity and employment levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am afraid to say that the testimony of countless employers in this industry goes against that reassurance. On 2 December last, in relation to the decision to protect Australia's motor industry from second-hand imports, he commented that it was his wish to protect Australian industry and consumers from imports of second-hand cars, and also noted that the various proposals involved relatively small numbers. Furthermore, he was quoted the next day in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        as saying that he would not allow second-hand car imports to jeopardise the local industry. If we take that kind of logic as being the reason for that decision and if we acknowledge the reality in the industry that there is heavy unemployment occurring, that there are businesses closing because of this very aspect of importation, the logic says that this industry itself should be looked at in the same context.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I must say that the employers in this particular industry have over the last few years smartened up their act considerably in regards to technical college training. They have put a lot of their own personal time into designing courses. At Wetherill Park in western Sydney, they now have a skill training process which is giving to the youth of this country a far greater capacity in this industry than has previously been the case. As I say, a lot of them have been prepared to do this in their own time. They have worked solidly on these courses, but they have been doing that at a time when there has been rampant unemployment in the industry. Surveys have shown that the vast majority of employers have both been forced to reduce their staff and to massively slash apprentice numbers.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are a few other aspects of this industry that must cause concern. The reality is that it is increasingly difficult around the world to find space to dump materials. We know that it is wrong in the first place, we know that the emphasis must be on recycling and maintaining, but we have a situation here now where, rather than the reconditioners having the opportunity to continue the use of these motors, their industry is being smashed to pieces by the importation of second-hand motors. Just on environmental grounds, it is a very questionable priority for the Government.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         These local employers had to take a little bit of interest in the Australian standard for reconditioned spark ignition engines. If we go through that, it has got quite a variety of requirements. For instance, it says that magnetic particle crack detection, water and vacuum testing as appropriate must be carried out; all main bearing tunnels shall be measured for size and checked for concentricity; and cylinder heads shall be inspected for damage and crack tested and/or pressure tested. The list goes on. These requirements hit the local reconditioners; they have to abide by those. We have the reality that those importing second-hand motors certainly do not meet those requirements—they are not expected to and they do not.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So once again we have a situation where there is another question about this whole policy emphasis, that the motors do not meet that Australian standard, a standard which the regulators in this country think is required. But apparently second-hand motors are a totally different issue from second-hand car importation. As I say, this is another aspect of what is occurring in this industry.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In conclusion, we have a situation where Australian employment is being heavily hit. It is a situation that also obviously has a bearing on other sectors of the motor industry, including the suppliers. We have a situation where the fact that we allow this is an environmental threat to this country; I do not want to exaggerate it but it certainly is there. We have a situation where there is no requirement that the second-hand motors meet our own standards. So, for all those reasons, it is a situation where the Government should very seriously look at the policy decisions. I also note that even the advertisements of those who do import certainly indicate that there will be special problems with these engines because of the supposed different conditions.

Let me just tell honourable members that in Tasmania at the moment youth unemployment is running at 35 per cent and adult unemployment at 11.2 per cent, so things are grim. You have all heard me talk about the greenies in Tasmania. You all know my sentiments on what they have done to my State so I will not talk about them. Let me just say to APPM and the workers of APPM: why do you not compromise? Why do you not go back to work, feed your children, pay your mortgages and look after everything that you have to look after? There are a lot of people in the State at the moment who are suffering as a result of that strike. It is not doing the economy of Tasmania any good, and it does not do me any good to come into this Parliament and hear both sides talking about the strike and taking one side or the other.

         —Earlier this week the Queensland Law Society announced that it will be holding regular courses, starting next month, to train solicitors as advocates. The Queensland Law Society President, Mr Ray Rinaudo, quite correctly in my view, said that litigation costs could be reduced in many cases if solicitors appeared in court as advocates rather than brief out the work to barristers. That is an eminently sensible idea and one that will ultimately make the law more accessible to the general public in Queensland. In fact, I hope it is the start of a push for a fused profession in Queensland, something that is long overdue.

         What was the reaction of the Queensland Bar Association to these training courses? Typically, the Bar Association's response, through its President, Kerry Copley QC, was to denigrate solicitors and say that solicitors acting as advocates would be like GPs doing the work of brain surgeons. Who do these barristers think they are? For too long in Queensland, barristers have considered themselves an elite part of the legal profession, when in reality the ability of many of them is such that one would not brief them to do an adjournment by consent. The Queensland Bar Association should come down from its ivory tower and support the Queensland Law Society's very important initiative.

         —Thirteen days ago at a media release, I raised the disgraceful portrayal of the motor car industry and timber industries in the World Environment Day kit distributed by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. The remarkable admission by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) this morning that her Department was lax is an understatement, to say the least. Does the Minister regard it as acceptable to print 25,000 copies of the kit that has in it a cartoon of a motor vehicle factory showing the words `Dodgy Motor Corporation' and employees going into the workplace in a single line? This cartoon is capped off by smoke stacks. What an inappropriate way to portray Ford in Geelong and all other manufacturing plants, not just for cars, throughout Australia.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The kit also featured the timber industries. This brochure stated that Westerners have logged all their forests and it made absolutely no mention of the sustainable forest practices now in place across Australia. This is a deplorable misrepresentation of the facts. The World Environment Day kit was distributed to every Australian school and many other copies were available free of charge across the counter at government bookshops. The Department spent $50,000 on the project. Today the Minister withdrew her endorsement for today's planned launch. This document is typical of the misrepresentation put forward by some environmentalists and Green groups. Hopefully, this will be a lesson to the Minister, her Department, the consultants—Social Change Media—and the environmental lobby to get their facts straight and present their arguments in an honest and straightforward manner.

         —Tory politicians and the United Graziers Association of this country have come into this House and complained about dumped products coming into Australia, and yet they support dumped labour coming into this country and the breakdown of award conditions and destruction of the very real wages that are needed, as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) said, for workers to feed their families. It is not only hypocritical but it is un-Australian for those opposite to posture with flags made in Taiwan in front of them and support non-Australian labour to work in the rural industries of this country.

         —I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the Parliament to the importation of pork into Australia. The pork is coming from Canada and it is of great concern to the pig farmers here generally. I might just point out that in August 1990 there were 1,479 kilograms imported; in February of this year there were 387,000 kilograms of frozen pork imported.

         There is a question about disease in this pork but, as it is frozen, that risk problem might have been overcome. However there is great concern that it is affecting the pig industry here in Australia. Basically, these imports are setting the retail price for pork here in Australia. We do not know—I am not certain of the fact—whether or not the pig farmers of Canada are being subsidised as far as pork production is concerned.

         This situation is of particular significance when honourable members consider the importance of the export industry to the Australian citrus growers. For example, the Japanese import 500,000 tonnes of citrus fruit a year. That is equal to the entire Australian crop, but in fact in the best years only 5,000 tonnes of that has come from Australia. The people of Hong Kong import 150,000 tonnes of citrus fruit every year, but in the best years only 1,000 tonnes of that has come from Australia.

Without quality and timeliness in delivery these markets will most surely be lost.

No one ever said to the Government, `Congratulations, these rates of growth are phenomenal, they are three times the OECD average'. It means that we started the 1980s with six million people in the work force and we finished the 1980s with 7.8 million people in the work force. We had nearly five to six times the employment growth in our first seven years that the previous Government had in its last seven years. But the Opposition does not comment about that. There is never even a begrudging note of compliment or of congratulations. It never cared for these people.

         The Leader of the Opposition asks questions about the young unemployed and their families when he is quite happy to market that, under his so-called Fightback proposal, they would go straight off unemployment benefits after nine months. If that is the case, they have to go down to the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Matthew Talbot Hostel, the Red Cross or the Salvation Army. That is the Opposition's policy. That is why we always treat its mock concern, its feigned indignation, with the contempt it deserves.

We are told that 16 people were killed and over 150 were injured in another example of cruelty and ethnic conflict.

         It appears that even the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff have maintained operations in some of the most bloody conflicts in the world, has announced that it is withdrawing its workers from Sarajevo. All sides must bear some responsibility in this, obviously. But it is clear that the Yugoslav National Army and its allies who are pursuing Serbian interests must shoulder the overwhelming responsibility.

         Australia supports the immediate imposition of sanctions against Serbia by the UN Security Council and also it supports similar moves by the European Community. If, however, international sanctions are not imposed soon, Australia is prepared to consider action itself against Serbia, in concert with other like minded countries. The Government has already taken some measures against Serbia, including the exclusion from our program of assistance for eastern Europe, and access to our system of tariff preferences for Serbia. Senator Evans has also announced that the Australian Ambassador in Belgrade will not be replaced when he completes his assignment this week. Australia will continue to reserve its position on the Federal Republic's claims to be the legitimate successor state.

         —My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's predecessor, Bob Hawke, said that a Minister should resign on a matter when it was one where the Minister `obviously should have known and done something'. Given that Senator Evans knew about Senator Richardson's plan to phone the President of the Marshall Islands on 3 April, given that his office was advised on 6 April that Senator Richardson may have called not only the President but other Cabinet Ministers, and not just to get a passport for a relative but to seek leniency, and given that Senator Evans failed to act in response to any of this and has failed to give a complete explanation, I want to ask him two critically important questions. First, if Senator Evans will not resign, will he stand him down, particularly when the whole Evans story reeks of a cover-up, and there are precedents on exactly the same basis—for example, John Brown? Second, if he is not prepared to stand him down, are we to conclude that he is not even prepared to uphold the absolutely minimal ministerial standards of his predecessor?

That was scuttlebutt and hearsay, and he made it clear to Senator Evans that his intention was that he should ring and ask for this leave for his passport.

I want to make it clear in response to the honourable member for Parramatta that, as far as the Government's policy is concerned and as far as the existing wholesale sales tax is concerned, both before and after the changes that we propose, the tax is paid once and once only.

         In the course of this debate I have noticed that there has been an attempt on the part of some of those opposite to totally misrepresent a proposal of theirs. I refer to the honourable member for Fadden who, by the way, is also a member of the Opposition's tax reform campaign group. On Queensland radio on 5 April he said, `There's no GST on any secondhand goods'. As if to underscore the point, he went on to say:

        It is my melancholy duty today to expose the deceit involved in that remark and, indeed, in the remarks made by very many other Opposition spokesmen and spokeswomen as they go around trying to campaign for their tax. They have been saying that because there is no tax in respect of the transfer of second-hand goods from one private individual to another or in a case where a donated second-hand good is then sold to another person, there is an absence of taxation—the GST—on second-hand goods.

Government transport policy has an essential objective: more efficient delivery of services to the community. Proper cost recovery is one element which helps to ensure efficiency gains.

         The fact that we are now able to re-examine that policy is in no small measure due to the very substantial elements of micro-economic reform and the approach undertaken by the Government to the Civil Aviation Authority. The Civil Aviation Authority is in the process of reducing its staff from around 7,400 to 3,800 by 1996, with the most significant reductions coming this financial year. The savings from a far more efficient civil aviation industry are being passed on to the industry. These include a $96m reduction in charges to the major airlines in 1992-93.

         In the safety regulation area, which is pertinent to the honourable member's question, the CAA has advised that the total cost will be halved, from $88m to $45m, by 1994-95. These savings are well in advance of what we anticipated in the phased-in cost recovery from the airlines, and place us in a position in which we can give that matter reconsideration.

          There are a few views around on what we ought to do about that, which will inform the decisions taken by the Cabinet. One of them came from the honourable member for Fadden.

        What will we see before the next election? The policy, of course, that the honourable member is devoted to, understands fully, up hill and down dale—that of the GST package. What does the GST package say? It says this:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government announced in the 1990-91 Budget its intention to phase in full cost recovery for air safety activities from 1 November 1992. In the 1991-92 Budget, this decision was reversed so that cost recovery would only start to phase in from 1 November 1992. The Coalition will implement full cost recovery for air safety activities forthwith, saving $20 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as those opposite are concerned, they can go out and say anything in public about the GST package. They tell us that this is a complete package; that it is all well understood by the Opposition front bench; that it is all well accepted and has been debated fully by the Opposition Liberal Party and National Party caucuses; and that this is something they can commit themselves to, line by line. Yet they stand up in public repeatedly and walk away, day after day, from every single proposition in it, depending on who their audience happens to be at the time.

         He is a good-hearted person, the honourable member for Fadden, and he tries to do his best for the tourism industry. He knows that it is sinking slowly beneath the waves as far as the Opposition's GST package is concerned. He is running out of places in the tourism industry where people will give him a civil dinner.

The Australian public are being told that they have to take absolutely all of this as a total package at face value. It is no wonder that some of you with a bit of human decency want to walk away from point after point in it; but I am afraid we are not going to let you do that. When you do choose to walk away from the GST package, we will choose to expose that activity here, as we expose the entire package to the public in this country.

We see today that they are going to have a US-style convention—a policy fair—in Sydney where they are expecting thousands will come. Businesses will have a choice of three sized booths. So you can actually take a booth—a $750-booth; a $2,500-booth or a $10,000-booth. The Federal director of the Liberal Party, Andrew Robb, said last night that policy debate would not be a big focus of the convention. Another way of saying it is that Fightback is bereft of life and rests in peace, but people can come to pay homage to it.

There is going to be no policy debate, no real consultation, no discussion about policy—unlike the Government, which is continually meeting and talking with the business community. The fact is that in the language of Monty Python Fightback has joined the choir invisible. It has had it. It has gone. It is defunct. It is no more. It is late. It is a late Fightback. The fact is that this person over here has run out of ideas. Fightback is nothing but a nasty tax on consumption which tries to transfer wealth from the low paid to the high paid. He has been found out and now of all things we are going to be subject to the most flim-flam proposition of all—some sort of convention about Fightback and the nonsense of the Liberal Party State fair.

In her reply to an earlier question from the honourable member for Pearce, the Minister indicated that she had endorsed only the cover of the environment kit, and that when it came to studying the contents earlier today prior to launching it, she decided not to endorse the kit. I therefore ask: does the Minister recall recording an interview at about 4 p.m. yesterday, with the environmental misinformation kit open on her knees, in which she strongly defended its contents, describing suggestions that it was unbalanced as `paranoid', saying that critics of it were `hysterical and troglodytes' and saying, amongst other things, `Well, it just gives a factual account of the state of land degradation in the universe.'? When did she decide, as she said in Parliament in regard to an interview that the kit `does appear to be offensive to farmers', and that it contains distortions, errors of fact and is backward looking. How could the Minister strongly defend the kit—presumably reading it before making such comments or statements—and then disown it a few hours later?

After I did that interview, I then went through not only the details of the section on land degradation but also some of the other sections. I then rang my secretary and asked my secretary what processes had been followed through and whether there had been full consultation with senior officers of my Department. I found out that there had not been. I asked my departmental head to give me a full brief and to see if there were any inaccuracies. I believed there were.

         —The tariff reform package that was announced by this Government some weeks ago, which went through this House yesterday, does provide for a very strong future for the dairy industry and it involves a phased reduction in the level of tariffs. It was an outcome that was negotiated with the industry and is an outcome that it has applauded. That was recognised by honourable members opposite as well as by my own side, of course, when this was debated yesterday.

         The second part of the honourable member's question was whether there are any concerns by the dairy industry. The answer is that there are two concerns. One relates to the question of the abolition of underwriting, which I have indicated to the industry that it needs to see in the broader context of the package, which promises and will deliver substantial support without the need for underwriting. I think this is generally acknowledged by the other side of the House. That was one concern and a concern expressed essentially from Victoria and parts of Tasmania.

The reality is that the Opposition's Fightback package would not have allowed and could not allow this package to be delivered, and I will tell honourable members why.

        I ask members of the National Party to dwell seriously on these quotes because nowhere does the Leader of the Opposition say `negligible tariff', which is what the National Party has been running around the bush saying. It is what the honourable member for Barker says, but the Leader of the Liberal Party does not.

         —The one thing that I do say about the Leader of the Opposition is that he has been absolutely consistent. He has shown no wavering whatsoever in his ideological commitment to eliminating tariffs and in hoping that people can be looked after through an exchange rate. Despite the crisis over sugar, which rent the coalition asunder, which resulted in a resignation, which saw a divided National Party—10 : 11, I think it was—despite all that criticism, despite all the protestations that it has been sorted out, he continues on his merry way every time he gets an opportunity to make the point that `negligible' relates to protection and not tariffs, and the coalition will eliminate tariffs.

         I quoted him yesterday in relation to the Mining Industry Council speech where, categorically, plain as the nose on your face, he said, `We will eliminate tariffs'. If he has not wavered yet under that pressure, he would not waver if he were to win. That means that, if the other side were to come to power, the dairy industry would not have the support and confidence which it has now been offered, and which it accepts. So there will be a very clear choice at the next election in relation to all those seats that have substantial dairy farming constituencies—a clear choice as to where we stand and where the Opposition stands. Our position is one the industry has clearly said it can live with, but what it cannot live with is zero tariffs.

         The reality is that the National Party has deserted its so-called claimed constituency. I might add that last night, when this matter was being debated, despite the protestations about the guillotine, against the background of an industry that supported this package, the Deputy Leader of the National Party called a quorum on his own speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). What a great tactical feat—during a guillotine he called a quorum! But the more interesting point was, when the House assembled for the debate, how many members of the National Party were in the  chamber. How many? Not one.

         —The citing of the number of people on waiting lists is often misleading. The fact is that the number of people on waiting lists represents a very small proportion of all hospital admissions. In Victoria, the number of people who are currently on waiting lists represents only 3 per cent of all hospital admissions. In that State the number of people treated in public hospitals in the first five years of Medicare grew by 17 per cent compared with 7 per cent in the five years pre-Medicare.

         The family allowance supplement was designed to provide family support for working but low income families—that is, families who are in work but who may be on low or minimum incomes. It was designed to ensure that those families received more than families which were simply dependent on unemployment benefits. The whole purpose and design of the family allowance supplement was in fact to provide those incentives to working families who were on very low incomes.

         We are very grateful indeed to the new shadow spokesman for social security for making so clear the intention of the Liberal Opposition—that is, that it would create a minimum wage based on basic unemployment benefit rates and top it up with family payments. We already know that Austrain—that euphemism—is certainly not a training program. It is certainly not an employment program because, in essence, it means that workers on award rates would be displaced by employers who could get unemployed workers at much lower wage rates. It is in no way a scheme to create work.

         Indeed, it is—as members of the Opposition know—simply a scheme for reducing wages in this country: a form of wage depression. In other words, it is using the recession to have a form of exploitation. We were never quite sure what the level of that exploitation was because in the great

We did not know quite what the Opposition meant by the `rate of benefit', but our friend the honourable member for Bradfield has made it perfectly clear. We should all listen to this. The honourable member said that he interpreted the Fightback policy—I know that it needs some interpretation—to mean that employers would only have to peg wages to the base rate of benefit minus the family payments. That means that what those opposite are saying is that there would be a minimum wage of $255 a week—lower than the minimum wage rates in this country—and that would be topped up with the family benefits.

         That in fact means that, for instance, a worker with a wife and two children would receive not a single cent more if he were in employment under that condition, under that encouragement. You immediately destroy the whole basis of the incentives that we have built into the system if you accept the definition of Fightback from our friend the honourable member for Bradfield—perhaps he has been told that he had better change it quick. That is the clear implication of what is being said. The whole family allowance supplement, which is designed to provide incentives for working low income families, is immediately undermined and the incentives to get back into work are removed because not a single cent more is gained under this proposal.

         It is about time that this whole country condemned this Austrain proposal on three grounds: first of all, it implies a minimum wage which is equal to basic unemployment payments, and the whole incentive system goes out the window; secondly, it would displace existing workers because you could get these cheaper workers; and, thirdly, it would simply provide cheap labour to be exploited without any guarantee of real training.

         The million people who have no jobs because of these high taxes, plus another million who are working only a few hours per week because that is all that is available, are typically people who simply want to earn a living, to house, feed and clothe themselves and their children, and to provide a decent standard of living and a good education to give their children a good start in life. But they are denied that right because of the high and increasing levels of tax imposed by this Government.

         this morning under the heading `Each day, 500 children join the 680,000 who have neither parent working'. The article goes on to tell us that 680,000 Australian children are growing up in homes where neither parent has a job, and their numbers are increasing by more than 500 a day. These are official statistics released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

         One salient point contained in the statistics is that more than one in six Australian children aged 14 or under now have no family breadwinner in a job. It is one thing to have statistics, but what that means to actual families is quite another thing. Dr Don Edgar, the Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in commenting on the tragic plight of all those families and children who have neither parent in employment, warns—and he is really warning us as legislators—that if parents remain unemployed for a long time it could seriously harm their children's future. Research, he tells us, on kids growing up in the depression indicates that younger kids were seriously affected by their parents' unemployment. Dr Edgar went on to say:

        I do not think there would be a member of this House on either side that has not heard either by phone or from families actually coming into their offices of the plight that they are in. I am no exception. Just yesterday one of my constituents in the electorate of McEwen told me that her husband has been unemployed for almost 12 months. They have three children. One is doing year 12 this year and, in Victoria, that is a very difficult task. They also have an aged parent living with them.

         The woman went on to tell me that once they used to be able to afford things such as private health insurance. They can no longer do so. They cannot even afford for their children to have dental care. They cannot afford for their children to go on school camps and excursions. That puts a human dimension to the face of all those unemployed, a situation which the Government's policies have created.

         The reason these families are in this intolerable situation is that companies and small businesses which formerly employed them can no longer afford to do so. They can no longer afford to employ them because the costs of running their businesses have increased to such levels that their businesses are no longer viable.

         Let me give just one example from a group of people I spoke to earlier this morning—that is, the Tractor and Machinery Association. In 1984, in this group of industry there were 2,400 agricultural dealerships. The latest figure available, which was given to me this morning, is unfortunately for 1990, so the situation will now be much worse. It shows that the number had dropped from 2,400 to 950. That represents a reduction in the number of people it employs of 16,500 people. That is a direct result of the policies that the Government has in place. Every single member of this House could talk about the hundreds of such businesses that they know about in their own electorates all over the country. But those statistics represent families and those families are hurting.

They want somebody to have a go at fixing up the mess that this Government has created. They want us to do something to change this system that is causing them so much hardship.

         Last November the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) released the most detailed plan to rebuild and restore our country and to give business and families that chance, the chance that all those families are asking for. It is a plan that will give those families the boost they need to get back on their feet, to do away with the very harsh impact that the present high taxation policies are having on them. The heart of that plan which, as those in the Government know, we call Fightback removes $20 billion worth of those high and hidden taxes that are causing businesses to be uncompetitive, unproductive and non-viable and, ultimately, another unemployment statistic.

In reforming this high tax system in order to create secure jobs, the Opposition, as the shadow Treasurer was saying earlier, is not introducing the GST in isolation. There will be major cuts to personal taxes so that 95 per cent of all taxpayers will never pay more than 30c in the dollar. Families will save on the abolition of the fuel tax. Every time they go and fill up their car at the local petrol station, they are going to save at least $10.

         I believe we should be asking this Government why it is spending so much time trying to scare people about our plan to rebuild this country. The answer lies in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. It offers absolutely no hope for the future; no plan to restart our economy and provide secure long term jobs. In fact, all it does is provide more of the same sort of policies that have put us in the mess we are in now. It does not give any relief to the four million people who earn up to $20,700 a year. Now that the Budget deficit has blown out, it is not going to be giving any tax cuts whatsoever.

It will be very interesting if this debate is to be led in the next few months, or until the next election, by two women, because it was perfectly obvious the day after Fightback was announced that it was the women of Australia who were a wake up to what was happening. On talkback radio the day after Fightback—when the Opposition was trying to get the papers of Australia to talk about the new vision and so on—it was the women of Australia who rang the radio stations and asked, `But what does this mean? What does a 15 per cent tax on everything we buy and every service that is provided mean?'. I did not say a 15 per cent rise, as the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) claimed. Of course, we are telling them what it means.

         This matter of public importance is about tax, so let us talk about it. It was mentioned very often by the honourable member opposite, and by her colleagues who shouted out in her support, that we have such a high income tax rate in Australia. I am going to tell those opposite for the five hundredth time—people will not believe it, but it is a fact—that Australia takes the second lowest in total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product of all the OECD countries. In the sorts of countries that those opposite ideologically aspire to, for instance, in the United Kingdom, the total tax revenue is 36.5 per cent. In New Zealand, which those opposite are so fond of citing—please remember this figure, everyone; this is not scare tactics, it is what is happening in New Zealand—it is 39.4 per cent. But in Australia it is 30.1 per cent, equal with the United States.

I will tell honourable members what has happened since we came into government and recognised that a sole parent with children is a family unit. This, by the way, was after those opposite had spread the rumour, the myth, that a sole parent was a teenager wanting to have a baby to get money. Of course, it has now been established that the vast majority—about 84 per cent—of sole parents are women in their late thirties or early forties who have been in a long established relationship, a marriage or a de facto relationship, and who are left with three or four children. Can we imagine such a woman being on the television as a case history of a sole parent? Yet that is the typical sole parent in Australia. When we came into government the real income improvement figure for a sole parent not renting privately went from minus 13.8 per cent to 29.2 per cent.

That is what we do for families. What about the traditional family, not the sole parent but the traditional family that those opposite imagine when they talk about the family? For a start, we indexed payments for children, and in 1987 we introduced the family allowance supplement to assist low income working families. All payments for children have now been made tax free. That is what a family is, a unit with children. We focused on the children, and all payments for children have been made tax free.

         I bring this back to the matter of public importance: what has our taxation system done for families? How about that? A major reform of the family assistance scheme announced in the 1991-92 Budget will make the system simpler and more consistent. It will increase assistance to low and middle income families and will provide stronger incentives for work force participation—the real contribution to Australia. The One Nation statement, of course, provides for a further increase in assistance. The combined rates of family allowance and family allowance supplement have been tied to the combined married rate of a pension to ensure that their real value is maintained.

         Family allowance and family allowance supplement combined currently provide the equivalent of $75.50 net income per week to low income families with two children under 13 years of age. It goes on and on; I am not sure how much of this I can fit in, but all the facts, I remind those opposite, are there to read. I ask them to listen to this: over the period from March 1983 to March 1992, payments targeted to low income families increased in real terms by 57 per cent for children under 13 years and by 129 per cent for teenage children of 13 to 15 years. Of course, it is at this stage that I just wonder which families the Opposition wants to benefit. We, of course, are targeting all of our programs to low income families.

The cost of food in general will be up by 9 per cent—I am not saying 15 per cent; I hope the honourable member opposite realises that I do understand the difference between a tax and a price rise—and the price of many staples such as fresh fruit and vegetables will go up by over 10 per cent. At the same time those opposite will raise the price of soft drinks and confectionery. They say the price of a milkshake will not go up so much. Of course, it will only go up by 4.3 per cent, but fruit and vegetables will go up by 10 per cent. Clothing will go up by 11.2 per cent.

         Let me make one point clear. We can talk about statistics until the cows come home. If indeed the Minister is correct that Australia is one of the lower taxed countries of the OECD countries, then I would hate to live in one of those other countries, because I can tell the Minister that in the world that I live in—and it is not the world she lives in, I am quite sure—families are collapsing under a burden of taxation. But let me put it in context for honourable members. In March 1983 when the Hawke Government was elected, a single income couple with two children under 13 years on average weekly earnings had $264 a week of disposable income.

         At that time home loan repayments averaged $81 a week, leaving $163 or 62 per cent of after tax income in the pockets of the average family. Let us look at what was happening in June 1991. The same family had $432 a week of disposable income, but home loan repayments at that stage averaged $217 a week. An average family, if it were still able to support an average home loan, had just $215 or 50 per cent of after tax income in its pocket after mortgage payments. After inflation—and that is the big lie that this Government cannot answer—and after the effects of bracket creep, we can clearly demonstrate that this family and, indeed, most families, are $65 a week or more than 20 per cent worse off. That is the issue that this Minister has to address. Ten years into this Labor Government, families are now on average 20 per cent worse off than they were when Hawke came to power in 1983. That is the debate that we will have with this Government in the months ahead. The people of Australia know exactly what we are talking about.

I welcome both of their appointments very warmly. Although I appreciate the opportunity to speak in this debate, I cannot, unfortunately, agree with many of the comments made by the honourable member for McEwen in her contribution. The guts of the matter of public importance is that Australia has a crippling rate of taxation on families in particular, and that is leading to a whole range of social ills, from unemployment to broken homes to bankruptcies, and to any particular thing one wants to point one's finger at.

         Of course, the reality is that Australia is not a high tax country. Honourable members opposite will decry this and deny it, but the reality is that figures produced, not by this Government but by international agencies such as the OECD, in a comparison of Australian taxation rates with those of other industrial countries, indicate that Australia has about the second lowest overall level of taxation in the 24 nations which make up the OECD. I think only Turkey has a taxation rate which is lower than Australia's.

         What is different, I suppose, about Australia is the nature of the tax mix, in that in Australia we have higher levels of personal tax and lower levels of other taxes. The Opposition's great formula for turning Australia around is simply to change the tax mix. Opposition members are not really talking about cutting taxation; they are talking about covering government spending. They are merely switching the nature of the taxation.

          They are taking the emphasis off personal income tax and putting it on a tax on goods and services. They say, `From this will flow a whole range of beneficial outcomes'. Yet when we actually look at their particular policies and what impact they would have on Australian families, we see no beneficial outcome at all. If there is any beneficial outcome, it is concentrated most heavily on people on higher incomes, the most well off in the Australian community.

         This Government has been a government of taxation reform. The Opposition does not like to admit it, but indeed the Government has.

         At the same time, we have brought in a widening of the tax base in Australia—we do not walk away from it; we are proud of it—by introducing taxes such as the capital gains tax. That was opposed by the Opposition. The capital gains tax was going to be the end of the world as we knew it. It was going to cause economic decay. Of course the United States has had a capital gains tax since 1913, and it does not seem to have led to the end of the world over there. Opposition members cite many countries in the world which have a goods and services tax, and yet the vast majority of those same countries have a capital gains tax.

         The other thing which always galls me when I hear Opposition members talk about families is their selective reference to families. They will pick out some family groups and try to be the champion of those, but they will ignore all the rest. One particular group, I suppose, is sole parents. Opposition members claim to be pro-family, but how pro-family is their policy in their Fightback proposals which says that Australian families who are reliant on the supporting parent's benefit will lose that benefit once their youngest child turns the age of 12? How pro-family is it to say, `Okay, the kid has turned 12, off you go; you go on unemployment benefits, if you qualify.'?

         They are pro-family except for those families they would take off unemployment benefits after nine months. I remember very well the last election campaign. One of the mini-commercials of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who was the Leader of the Opposition at the time, had him sitting there looking very concerned and sincere. We could see the pages of the calendar getting ripped off. He finally got to month No. 9 and he was saying, `We will get rid of the unemployment benefits after nine months; that's time enough'. At the time it was perceived to be good politics on behalf of the Opposition parties to imply that those people who were on unemployment at that stage really could have got a job; it was good politics to suggest that they would give them a bit of a kick along and get them off the benefit after nine months.

They say, `Oh no, that is not the end of the story. People can go onto special benefits'. Yet their own figuring in their policy indicates that they will be making massive savings out of this transfer from the Job Search allowance onto the special benefits, and that means tens upon thousands of families falling through the gap. People do not go from unemployment benefits onto special benefits; they are without any government support whatsoever. How pro-family are the Opposition's policies in terms of those people, those families, children in those situations? They are not particularly pro-family at all.

         We have been getting a sort of selective indignation from the Opposition. The honourable member for McEwen in her contribution today said that this Government is anti-family and is crippling families with its taxation policies.

         The Minister has already outlined the great increases that have been made in real terms in family allowance benefits and supplements to ordinary families. We had the extraordinary statement today from the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), that as one of its changes to wage rates the Opposition would have a minimum wage rate below the threshold of the family allowance supplement and that the family allowance supplement would be added to it; that the minimum a person could get with wages and government assistance combined would equal the unemployment benefits. As well as it being an absolute kick in the guts if that policy were ever introduced, what sort of incentive—that is a word that the Opposition used to be fond off; we used to have `incentivation' and `Future Directions' before we finally got up to Fightback—is it for an individual to be able to say, `I am are better off staying on a government welfare benefit than I ever will be trying to get out, because even if I get out I can be cut down to the same level.'? I suppose that goes hand in glove with the idea of saying, `After nine months you get kicked off unemployment benefits; you cannot get special benefits because you are not absolutely destitute and we will not give them to you until you have sold all your belongings'.  It  is  an  absolute  fraud;  it  is  a sham.

         —This Bill is primarily a housekeeping Bill which, by virtue of its nature, does not require a lot of debate. Essentially, it amends the Ministers of State Act 1952 to increase the annual gross sum of money appropriated for payment of Ministers' salaries. The amendment proposed by this Bill is a requirement of section 66 of the Constitution, which prescribes a maximum amount of money for the payment of Ministers' salaries. Changes to the appropriation are put in place by an amendment to the main Act.

         To this end, the Parliament has, over previous years, debated Bills similar to the one which is currently before the House. The additional amount which this Bill adds to the Ministers' salary pool is some $33,000 over this financial year and $61,000 over the year 1992-93. It increases the allocation from which Ministers' salaries are paid from $1.477m to $1.51m in this financial year and from $1.51m to $1.54m in the year 1992-93. The additional amount allocated equates to a salary increase of 2.5 per cent, effective from August 1991.

         In requiring that additions to the appropriation from which ministerial salaries are paid be put into place by legislation, the Parliament—and, hence, the community—is being the opportunity to scrutinise any increase in benefits. According to the Remuneration Tribunal:

       <para>
        As I have already mentioned, the sum appropriated by section 66 is simply to meet the cost of Ministers' salaries. It does not set the rates of salary payable to individual Ministers. Indeed, as members and senators would be aware, the salaries of Ministers are tied to the salaries of members of the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service. Allowances and other benefits are set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal.

         The method of determining Ministers' salaries has undergone some changes in recent years. The introduction of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, amongst other things, was responsible for tying the parliamentarians' base salary to that of the Senior Executive Service. As such, members and senators receive the same salary as the second lowest level of the Senior Executive Service, while Ministers' salaries are in line with the top of the Senior Executive Service band 1 scale.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         That these changes are overdue can be illustrated by the fact that prior to 1990 the base salary of many Ministers was well below that of their own Department heads. In 1989, for example, the Treasurer's total salary—including his base wage and allowances—was $84,000. The Secretary to the Treasury, on the other hand, received just over $100,000. Similarly, in 1989 the Minister for Social Security received just under $81,000, while the head of his Department was paid more than $92,000.

         While the removal of this anomaly was welcome, the coalition believes that the new salary scales should have been set by an impartial and independent body. We do not consider it appropriate for the Government to set its own salary scales. The Remuneration and Allowances Act also sets in place procedures to ensure that the relativities between the salaries of Ministers and parliamentarians are maintained. As such, Ministers' salaries will increase in line with those of members and senators over the same period of time.

         One of the difficulties with the new arrangements is that because the salaries of Ministers and parliamentarians are linked to the remuneration of the Senior Executive Service, their base salaries rise or fall in line with the award or wage agreements made with the Senior Executive Service through its union. This not only removes the parliamentarians from the wage negotiation process but also, for the coalition, it goes against our fundamental principle of awarding wage rises according to individual and workplace bargaining. Indeed, the current situation gives parliamentarians little scope to negotiate wage packages according to productivity increases, changes in responsibilities or other performance indicators.

         Moreover—and of particular concern—it ensures that the salaries of members, senators and Ministers are no longer reviewed or set by an independent or impartial body. In its 1992 review, the Remuneration Tribunal noted:

        As I have said, this is an area of extreme concern for the coalition and, in government, we will ensure that the determination of the salaries and other benefits of members, senators and Ministers reverts to an independent and impartial body. In the meantime, we will not be opposing this Bill.

         —The A.C.T. Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill 1992 deals with the transfer of the ACT Supreme Court and responsibility for it to the Australian Capital Territory Executive and Assembly. The court was established by the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933. According to the Attorney-General's Department annual report for 1990-91, the court comprises: a chief judge; two other resident judges; 13 additional judges, each of whose primary commission was as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia; and a master.

         At 30 June 1991, the court employed 26 full time officers, four casual sheriff's officers, and five temporary officers employed as staff of the judges and master. The registrar of the court has responsibility for the management of the court as well as performing certain statutory functions, including exercising judicial and quasi-judicial functions delegated by the judges. In addition, the registrar supervises the functions of the sheriff of the ACT.

         Expenditure in relation to the court in 1990-91 totalled $2.756m and it is estimated that it will cost about $2.742m for 1991-92. As part of the process of handing back responsibility for the administration of the Australian Capital Territory to those who reside in the Territory, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 set out the powers to be delegated to the Legislative Assembly of the ACT.

         Under section 23 of that Act, however, the Assembly has been excluded from making laws in relation to the establishment of courts. The exclusion is due to run out on 1 July 1992. As a result, it is necessary for this Parliament to make provision, if that power to make laws vested in the Assembly in relation to the Supreme Court is to be governed by any, as it were, constitutional considerations—the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act standing as it does as a constitution—in relation to the Legislative Assembly of the ACT.

         On 9 April 1992, the Assembly requested the Commonwealth Parliament to amend the self-government Act to insert a new part dealing with the judiciary. The new part was designed to ensure that any laws that were made in relation to the judicial power of the Territory had to be made in accordance with high standards—standards as regards continuity of proceedings, continuity of jurisdiction, protection for the independence of the judges, and so on.

         The Assembly requested the insertion of a proposed part which would allow the court to have original and appellate jurisdiction necessary to administer justice in the ACT. It also asked for provisions dealing with the removal from office of a judicial officer or member of a tribunal by the ACT Executive; but only at the request, by resolution, of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory, acting in accordance with the report of the judicial commission. The Assembly also requested a provision for the establishment of a judicial commission, having the function of investigating and reporting to the Attorney-General on allegations or complaints concerning the conduct or capacity of a judge, master, magistrate or any other specified judicial officer.

After this request was made—and it took the form of a motion in the ACT Assembly and was supported by the Opposition and Independents—that was referred to the Government and the Government has brought forward this Bill, the A.C.T. Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill. It is appropriate at this time, in the development of self-government for the Territory, to transfer the responsibility for the Supreme Court to the ACT Executive and Assembly and the duly elected organs of self-government in the ACT.

         There are some very interesting provisions in the Bill which is being passed, particularly the provisions which require a judicial commission to recommend to the Assembly in cases where it is sought to remove a judicial officer from office. This standard for the operation of a judicial commission is the standard recommended by the Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission in its 1988 report. The provisions which are to be inserted to form section 48D require that an enactment in relation to the court must provide that a judicial officer be removed from office only if a judicial commission examines a complaint, sets out the facts and states in its opinion that the facts could amount to misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. After the judicial commission has reported, the Assembly then has to determine on the facts so found that there is actual misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity and pass a motion requiring the Executive to remove the officer on those grounds, and in those circumstances the judicial officer may be removed by the Executive.

         In the Commonwealth system, and indeed in most of the States, the removal of judicial officers for misbehaviour is generally done upon the motion of the two Houses of the Parliament and generally on the grounds of misbehaviour. When those courts were established, the Parliament was seen as the proper check on misbehaviour by a judicial officer.

         As parliaments have developed, at both the Commonwealth and State levels, the parliaments, rather than seeing themselves principally and solely as freewheeling representatives of electors, have tended to organise themselves on party political bases. It has been much harder as a result to trust the independent political judgment of all of the representatives, free from political constraint or partisan considerations. As a result, there has been a tendency to provide for an independent judicial commission to act almost in a quasi-judicial way, but under the auspices of the parliament itself, to examine the facts and make findings on them and to make determinations as to whether that could amount to misbehaviour.

         Such a proposal does not take away from the legislature the ultimate responsibility for recalling a judicial officer for misbehaviour, for the report is only to the legislative body, and indeed under these provisions the judicial commission would report to the Assembly of the ACT. The requirement for a judicial commission to be inserted in the Act to enable laws to be made by the Assembly in relation to a Supreme Court on those terms and conditions is perhaps a new development. It is a development which one would hope will not have to be used, but one which could give rise to interesting studies from other States and, indeed, the Commonwealth, in relation to its own procedures for the recall of judges for proven misbehaviour.

         It does give rise to a technical problem, however, which has been raised with me by the Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory. I thank the society for its comments on this matter. It has pointed out that after the passage of this Bill there would be an inconsistency between section 48D, as I have just outlined, and section 7(6) of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act. The Bill before the House will amend subsection 7(6) of the ACT Supreme Court Act so that effectively it will provide that a judge may be removed on an address from the Houses of the Parliament in the same session on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.

         Even after that amendment, section 7(6) of the ACT Supreme Court Act will not correspond with section 48D, as will be inserted into the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988.

         The Bill, which does enjoy Opposition support, makes necessary provisions in relation to continuity of jurisdiction, continuity of office, continuity of proceedings and protection of judicial officers. It cannot be stressed too highly how important it is that we respect the independence of the judiciary at State, Territory and Federal levels. The independence of the judiciary from the Executive is one of the critical guarantees of freedom. To the extent that the independence of the judiciary is compromised, individual rights and liberties are placed at risk. The judiciary stands between the citizen and the Executive. The judiciary, as the enforcer of the rule of law, is one of the few institutions in society that can restrain government. Since we believe in the rule of law, a rule of law that binds parliaments, executives and governments as much as individuals, it is necessary to have an interpreter to apply that—and that, of course, is the judiciary.

This does not mean that every pay increase desired by the judiciary should be granted, but it does mean that there should be a mechanism to independently fix judicial salaries, which should not be at the mercy of other institutions in society which can, by the giving and taking away, exercise some influence over the very judiciary itself.

         —I am delighted that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) makes his maiden speech as shadow Attorney-General on the ACT Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill 1992, which transfers responsibility for the ACT Supreme Court to the ACT Government. In the nature of things, it is a relatively minor Bill, but it is important to the people of the ACT because it is one of the final stages of self-government and a necessary and appropriate part of completing the process of establishing the Australian Capital Territory as a self-governing entity.

         The Bill is entirely appropriate. I leave comment on the technical issues that the shadow Attorney-General has raised to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to reply to. I just want to make one point about the financial arrangements for the transfer, because it is quite clear that the Supreme Court building is very run down. It is unfortunate that a rather dilapidated building is being transferred. The Grants Commission has drawn attention to that problem in a number of other aspects of the transfer of functions and has given some additional funding to the ACT in other areas to cope with the problem. I think that ought to happen here also.

         The building is in poor repair. The air-conditioning does not work well. Conditions for jurors are of poor quality. The index is on cards rather than on computer. In other words, it is a very inadequate facility. It will have to be either refurbished to a major extent or rebuilt. I think the Grants Commission should take that into account in deciding on its next round of funding for the ACT. Having said that, I leave the rest of the debate to the Attorney-General.

         —in reply—Firstly, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) dealt with the matters raised by the Law Society in the ACT. Some of those matters were also raised in correspondence with me by the Chief Justice of the ACT. Both of those matters were raised by the Law Society with the honourable member for Higgins and with me. The Chief Justice has also raised those matters with me. I will deal with those in a moment.

         The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), this being his constituency, raised the question of the condition of the court. The former shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), interjected that it was a very dilapidated building. The honourable member for Fraser pointed out that there was a problem with the air-conditioning. The Commonwealth will spend about $315,000 this year on that air-conditioning and refurbishment in stage 3 of the refurbishment of the court as part of a scheme which has been ongoing for the past few years. There has been a lot of money spent on that court.

         I know the honourable member for Fraser can well take the view that it should be a lot better than it is. The first issue he raised, the question of air-conditioning, will be attended to, and stage 3 of the refurbishment of the court will be dealt with. The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department will be responsible for the maintenance of the building, cleaning and security costs until 30 June. After that, the ACT Government will take over, but it will be funded by the Commonwealth.

         Another matter raised by the honourable member for Fraser was the funding of such items as computers and jury trials. That is a matter for discussion between the ACT Government and the Department of Finance. That matter has been raised before by the honourable member for Fraser and others. Whilst the court has often liaised with the Department on funding matters, at the end of the day it is a matter for the Department of Finance to decide on the level of funding. The role that I think we can play in that is to assist both those parties to the negotiations, the ACT Government and the Department of Finance—if I could be so bold as to say that one would be able to assist the Department of Finance. I note the points made by the honourable member for Fraser and point out those matters to him.

         I now turn to matters raised by the honourable member for Higgins. Incidentally, this is his first debate since he became shadow Attorney-General, and I hope that it was coincidental that the former shadow Attorney-General was in the House and that he was not here as some sort of junior counsel. I notice that he has now left. The honourable member for Higgins raised matters which had been raised with him by the Law Society. Those matters were also raised with me by the Chief Justice of the ACT Supreme Court. Whilst the concerns are well placed, if those concerns had substance, I think they are matters that the ACT Law Society and the Chief Justice would raise, but I do not know whether they are correct on this issue.

         The first matter raised seems to be an objection that proposed new section 48A does not entrench the Supreme Court. That was one matter raised with me, although I do not think it was touched on specifically by the honourable member for Higgins. Section 48A, as the Chief Justice says, only defines the jurisdiction of the court. But it ought to be noted that the Supreme Court is defined in the self-government Act—a Commonwealth Act—as the Supreme Court of the Territory existing under the Supreme Court Act 1933. The ACT legislature, therefore, cannot legislate the Supreme Court out of existence. The court is provided with a level of protection which is not available to other State courts—or, for that matter, the Northern Territory Supreme Court—because the ACT Supreme Court is the subject, in this sense, of Commonwealth legislation.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I do not know why there has been concern expressed about the fact that section 48A does not entrench the Supreme Court. It does, as honourable members would know if they had read the definition of `Supreme Court' in the self-government Act—which is a Commonwealth Act. Despite the fact that the ACT now has self-government and all that goes with it, at this stage, whichever political party is in power, one would certainly hope there will not be any way in which the ACT will be able to override Commonwealth legislation on any issue.

         The second matter which I think was mentioned more specifically, and with a short discourse on judicial independence by the honourable member for Higgins, is something that we have agreed to over time in this place and if governments are not conscious of it and do not absolutely protect it we are all in diabolical trouble. The contribution of the honourable member for Higgins may have been a little more balanced than some of the contributions of his predecessor, although they did share similar views. In the past there were other matters which tended to intrude on the debate. I refer to the amendments to subsection 7(6) of the ACT Supreme Court Act relating to the removal of judges. This is a very important issue. Looking at all the matters in the Act and those which were examined, this is probably the most significant one that had to be addressed in transferring a court to any government—in this case the ACT.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the claims made is that the amendments to subsection 7(6) of the ACT Supreme Court Act relating to the removal of judges are ineffective because no reference is made in that section to the judicial commission. In that respect I think the amendments have to be read subject to new section 48D of the ACT (Self-Government) Act—that is, the Commonwealth Act—which provides that an ACT enactment providing for the removal of a judge must make provision for a judicial commission. However, the ACT Legislative Assembly has not yet passed the judicial commission legislation which means that, until it does, the ACT has no power to remove a judge even through the process that has been agreed upon. The Attorney-General's Department has been advised that the ACT Government accepts this limitation of its powers.

         If the shadow Attorney is not satisfied in respect of that matter, I can give him some more information in addition to what I have said today, rather than going through it line by line. It is quite clear that in respect of the Supreme Court issue—that is, the entrenchment of it and the question of the proper role in respect of any removal of a judge on the basis of what we have always said would be the basis for removal of judges, which can be done in only two ways—reference will be made to the judicial commission.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Providing that safeguard is probably all that can and should be done, because I do not know what else we can do. There are traditional rules for the removal of a judge, whether in the ACT or anywhere else. In the ACT both judges and magistrates will be removed only on the basis of misbehaviour or incapacity—as the shadow Attorney said—on an address of the Legislative Assembly.

         The amendments to the ACT (Self-Government) Act provide for the removal of a judicial officer at the request by resolution of the ACT Assembly, acting in accordance with a report of a judicial commission in which the commission has found that the behaviour or physical or mental capacity of the judicial officer concerned could amount to proved misbehaviour or incapacity such as to warrant removal from office.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is worth noting that the judicial commission to which we are referring—because of the enormous significance of this matter—will consist of persons who have been justices of the High Court or who are or have been judges of a superior court of record of a State or Territory other than resident judges of the ACT Supreme Court, and they will be appointed only by the Executive.

         The further safeguard to judicial independence in the self-government Act is found in the provision that remuneration and allowances—another point touched on by the honourable member for Higgins—of a judicial officer cannot be diminished while the officer holds office.

         —The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes some amendments to the Migration Act which are intended to achieve a number of outcomes. The first is to introduce a schema to permit the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to determine whether or not a person is a bona fide refugee. For the first time in legislation, this concept, which previously has been addressed administratively and has not been the subject of any legislative comments or definition, has been included in a new division in the relevant statute.

         The Bill also establishes a procedure for determination of refugee status. It provides that a person may apply and sets out certain matters that are to be considered in relation to determining whether or not a person is a refugee. It also prescribes a form and time limits on applications. It specifically excludes those who might be outside of Australia seeking determination under the system and also deals with the question of the order in which applications for refugee status may be dealt with.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The Bill states that the Minister, in considering these matters, is not required to consider an application if the person is already the holder of a permanent entry permit. It also prescribes that certain people who hold what are known as PRC temporary entry permits are not able to apply for refugee status. The Bill also indicates that the Minister may consider and dispose of applications in such order as he or she thinks appropriate.

         These are particularly important matters. They are designed to deal with a problem of control of entry to Australia of people who are claiming refugee status. They are designed to expedite the consideration of such applications and to enable the Minister to determine the order in which they will be considered so that those that are of a more pressing character may be able to be dealt with in priority. Notwithstanding the fact that we will support these provisions, I emphasise that in relation to the problems that this country faces in this matter and the steps that need to be taken to deal with them, these provisions are merely the starting point.

         Those provisions will in no way overcome the significant problems that we face. The issue of control of entry to and exit from Australia, which I have spoken of for years now, remains with us and will continue to remain with us until the Government is prepared to pick up the thrust of all the positive initiatives that I have suggested ought to be taken in this area. The fact is that these provisions are still only tinkering with the problem.

         Honourable members would be aware of the enormous backlog of claims from people seeking to stay in Australia by claiming refugee status. We have about 23,000 claimants at this time. The Minister in his second reading speech acknowledged what I have been saying for some time, that this number compares with the below 500 applications per year which used to be the base caseload that Australia had to consider. The fact is that this enormous increase is all the work of this Government. The reason why we have about 23,000 applicants is that some 17,000 students arrived in Australia after those tragic events in Tiananmen Square under what Minister Ray once called the pipeline processing arrangements. Those pipeline processing arrangements allowed students to enter Australia without having their bona fides tested. It was a mere pipeline into Australia for people who may well have wanted to stay here permanently rather than seek to be here for a short time to study.

         The Minister tells us that of the 25,000 students so admitted, only 23,000 have left Australia, and over 17,000 have lodged applications for refugee status. That is in addition to those who were granted the four-year temporary entry permits and who were the subject of the special arrangements put in place by Prime Minister Hawke and this Government to accommodate those who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The figure does not include those 14,000 PRC nationals who have applied, and have been allowed, to enter Australia because of their relationship with the 20,000 or so people who were here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

         The Minister highlighted that if these additional 34,000 people who held temporary entry permits were to seek to apply for refugee status now, whether they had an entitlement or otherwise, and were added to the 17,000 who were already claiming refugee status, the capacity to process all of those claims in some orderly and sensible way would be almost impossible to attain. We will support these provisions because they are a start in the process of trying to get the issue of control of entry to and exit from Australia under the guise of refugee status in hand. I will, as I comment on this matter later, suggest other positive steps that can be taken by this Government.

         The second provision relates to the proposals to put in place a mechanism for the cancellation of business permits or visas. The business migration scheme, now the business skills scheme, is well known. The fact is that many people who held out that they would contribute significantly to this country either by establishing a business or by undertaking certain forms of investments—those requirements were part and parcel of the conditions under which people were permitted entry—did not in the past comply with those requirements. This matter was the subject of very considerable adverse comment by the parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Government, of course, made some changes consequent upon that.

         In this legislation the Government is seeking to give the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs power to issue a notice to an applicant to comply with the undertakings that person may have given and to give notice that cancellation would occur unless the applicant was able to provide further information which would suggest that there were good reasons why he or she could not honour the undertakings. In this instance the power to cancel a visa or permit is one which is reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         The Bill will also authorise the Department to put in place reporting mechanisms for holders of business entry permits to provide information to the Department about where they are and what they are doing. Certain penalties are prescribed for that. It should be noted that, when the Public Accounts Committee carried out its investigation into this matter, it took the view that provisional entry arrangements ought not be appropriate for the business migration scheme. It set out reasons why that might be the case. It was very much concerned with the possible disincentive to those who were contemplating migration to Australia. The scheme proposed here, however, is not strictly a conditional entry scheme. With the provisions for notification, the requirements that must be satisfied and the appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, it certainly appears to the Opposition that the provisions are appropriate for support.

         The further matter that is dealt with is the proposal to create a liability in favour of the Commonwealth in respect of illegal fishermen who may have been taken into custody under section 88(3) of the Migration Act. The amount of the liability that is recoverable from either the person in custody or the master or owner or agent or charterer of a vessel who brought a person to Australia, or a third party who holds or will hold moneys on behalf of that person, is an important new initiative. It means that the Government will be in a position, for instance, to garnishee the amounts of money paid in the form of salary to illegal fishermen while held in detention, particularly in State gaols, and for that money to be recovered as a liability to the Commonwealth for its outgoings in relation to the apprehension and detention of the illegal entrant. I am sure that members on both sides of the House and the Australian people generally will be pleased to see that the Government has finally moved to remove one of the incentives that appear to have drawn illegal fishermen to our shores in the first place over a number of years. It is a matter that has been subject to very considerable comment.

         Other proposed amendments clarify certain provisions which relate to the review of applications made under the Migration Act. In particular, they ensure that unnecessary steps in the review process are eliminated by allowing the review authority to remit certain decisions to the original decision maker where they warrant reconsideration. For example, review authorities at the moment are prevented by law from directly advising the decision maker in the Department of what action needs to be taken before a final decision is made. If the review body requires health and character checks to be made before a final decision is possible, the application currently has to go through the Department, which will then advise the individual decision maker. It is a very circuitous route which will be bypassed by this amendment, and that certainly seems reasonable to us.

        Whilst I anticipate that these may well be areas in which this Government may move in time, the fact is that since this Minister has been in office there has been a rapid growth in the number of applications. As he acknowledges, the system is now the subject of a very significant backlog. Certainly a significant proportion of that number, some 17,400, are the direct result of the former Prime Minister's decision relating to the Chinese students who came to Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. However, the balance of 6,000 represents a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in Australia since the mid-1980s when the average was only 500 applications.

         It is quite likely that Australia will have a base level of around 6,000 to 7,000 applications to deal with each and every year, perhaps until the end of this century. It is certainly possible that the figure could be even higher. Regional conflicts, civil wars, human rights abuses, government incompetence, corruption, environmental degradation, famine, drought and other natural causes, the collapse of the Soviet Union and now Yugoslavia, the rise of nationalism, increasing ethnic conflicts, as well as growing disparity between the rich and poor, will lead to an unprecedented mass movement of people across the world. This is going to present significant problems not only to other countries but also, obviously, to Australia.

         In the past our geographic location has been seen as a basis upon which it is assumed that Australia is immune from this influx. But in an increasingly mobile world it is becoming more apparent that that is no longer the case. Even this week we have seen people from eastern Europe arriving on our northern shores, and I regret to say that I suspect that that may well be a sign of things to come. It is the case that, because of immigration quotas, the prohibition on most legal migration to western Europe and the strict qualifying criteria for other immigration countries, migrants and economic asylum seekers are increasingly trying to enter Australia through the very narrow window left open to grant people asylum because of political persecution.

         The coalition is of the view that we are facing very serious problems in relation to the issue of illegal entrants, asylum seekers and refugees. We see these problems, as they are evident at this time, as signifying a real loss of control of our borders in relation to determining who shall or shall not enter Australia permanently. We are of the view that maintaining control of our borders and asserting our right to determine who does or does not enter Australia for permanent settlement remains the single most important principle underlying our migration program. It is imperative that Australia sends a very clear message internationally and makes it clear to all those who seek to manipulate the system by making spurious claims, that they will be removed as quickly as possible.

         In part I think the Minister's failure until recently to acknowledge the depth of the crisis has meant that urgent procedural reforms and the judicial changes that need to take place—and which I have advocated—have been put off. The failure to acknowledge the fact that we face a crisis has meant that the additional resources for staff and prioritising work within the Department have not been taken. I acknowledge that changes have occurred, but I think the failure to acknowledge these things far earlier has meant that the urgency of this task has never really been understood by the Minister's colleagues who are responsible for determining the funds and the resources that are available for his own Department.

         This has led to the situation where no refugee case has been finally determined with all of those possible delaying procedures exhausted. Some applicants have been held in detention since November 1989. With the aid of many well-meaning supporters and taxpayer-funded legal advisers, refugee claims have been withdrawn, re-lodged and reargued, and delay ad nauseam has been occasioned. Now this delay is being used as the very basis for suggesting that those who are properly and legally held in detention should be released into the community.

         Australia does have an obligation to accept and resettle genuine refugees. We in the Opposition do not resile from that responsibility. However, the refugee program ought to be part of a planned program. The unplanned nature of onshore asylum seekers does lead to enormous difficulties and it diminishes our responsibility to assist those who might be seeking resettlement from abroad. The onshore component, growing as enormously as it has, has created difficulties in terms of Australia's ability to respond to genuine refugees offshore.

         The coalition has urged—I emphasise this again for the purpose of completeness—that fundamental reforms ought to be undertaken of the refugee determination system to make it more efficient, expeditious and fair. There needs to be, first, an acknowledgment that we are facing a crisis. Secondly, the staffing priorities need to be adjusted, with departmental officers freed up by the decline in migrant applications being redeployed to the task of refugee settlement—and any other officers, even from the citizenship area or wherever in the Department, put to this task because of its urgency. To ensure that obviously unfounded claims are dealt with immediately, applicants should first be required to obtain leave, possibly from the Immigration Review Tribunal, before they are allowed to make further and often spurious appeals against the first decisions made by departmental officers.

         —The contribution of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), covered two major aspects. On the one hand, there were various comments about some great correlation between the occupancy of the portfolio by the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and the growth in the refugee intake. There were also comments that there had been a real loss of control and a rapid growth in this area since he had become the Minister.

         On the other hand, the honourable member for Dundas, in a very swift process, then talked about a few of the fundamental problems in the world. In one line he actually mentioned that in eastern Europe there are great movements of different communities. There is starvation throughout Africa, obvious racial conflicts in India and problems in Indo-China—a multitude of reasons why there would be an increase in the refugee intake. But, as I have said, the honourable member gave only a fairly cursory coverage to the very real pressures on refugee programs throughout the world. It was fairly pitiful that he tried somehow to connect those problems with the current Minister and the policies in Australia.

         Those of us who follow events overseas are fairly aware that the problem is an international one; it is not occurring just in Australia. The growth of the Republicans party in west Germany, the National Front in France and the Freedom Party in Austria—all of those things have not happened by accident. There is a reason why these political changes are occurring. They result from the manifest problems that those countries also have with regard to refugee policy. Most of us know that Sweden, for instance, which prides itself on its humanitarian role in refugee programs, has clamped down. Obviously, west Germany is deeply considering major changes to its policies. The conflict in that country centres admittedly on racism on the one side, but obviously there is also a genuine concern by some people in west Germany that their system is being abused. Similarly, in most European countries that is an obvious reality. In America we see every day of the week the American response to Haitian migrants. Canada has major influxes of the Sikh community from India which it is finding goes way beyond genuine refugees.

         Certainly, as the shadow spokesman says, the Government has to be perceived by the public to be putting in place a policy that caters for this difficulty. There is obviously a widespread view in the community that the system is being rorted, and it is a view that is held in a variety of countries. That is the first point. We are faced with a burgeoning crisis, but it is not rectified by simply saying that there was some policy decision in the Department—who knows when—that suddenly created this, and that rectifying that tomorrow will totally solve the problem.

         I think the other point to bear in mind in analysing the realities of this matter is that it is all right to come into the House and talk about how long the process is and how manifestly unfounded a lot of the claims are, but we cannot isolate the migration policy and its appeal processes from the rest of the law in this country. One would think, from the way it has been spoken about today, that we can just ignore people's right under freedom of information to their files, and the greater requirements in the legal system than existed 15 or 20 years ago. People have the right to have it shown to them that they have been the subject of due process and that a fair decision has been made. That is another aspect of this matter.

         It is very easy to say, as many of us think, that perhaps legal aid should not be given to everyone who gets off a boat here, and that things are taking too long, but it is very difficult when one actually faces up to these kinds of issues to totally disconnect what happens within this portfolio and the processes required under our legal system from the rest of the legal requirements of the country. Those two matters have to be borne in mind when we look at the refugee problem.

         I think both sides of the Parliament perceive a problem in the way in which claims that have very little ground, from our perception of them, are clogging up the system for long periods. That is a matter that is obviously taking the time of policy committees on either side of this House. But, when it is all said and done, what is attempted here today is part of the solution. As has been said, it can be a problem when people can launch claims on fairly ridiculous grounds—that someone pulled his wife's scapular off, or that a third cousin was put in gaol for a day or so—and thereby remain here for the next three or four years with humanitarian appeals on the grounds that they have lost contact with their country of origin and are more attuned to Australian culture and society because they have been here so long.

         But what we see here today is an attempt by the Government to ensure that the latest claimants will not be able to be guaranteed a two- or three-year waiting period following the decision to handle their claims simultaneously with earlier claims in an attempt to do something about the backlog. Obviously, when all the criticisms are finished and all the attempts to put this very serious international problem down to some personalities are said and done, as I indicated, that is a constructive thing. As we all know, in reality the Opposition supports it.

         In the next 60 years we will probably reach a stage where we are no longer talking about an unfortunate decision by the previous Prime Minister with regard to Chinese students. I think most of us are fairly aware of the very bad example that set in refugee policy. But, at the same time, when there was talk about reallocating a few people in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to counter the problem, the Opposition was faced with reality concerning what it said about processing all of these claims individually. That is a fair thing; no-one is doubting it. Perhaps it should have happened, but when we start talking about the backlog and the problem of how long people can actually stand around in detention centres while their cases are coming up, I question what contribution that would have made to the backlog. I wonder how many additional people we would have had to employ to deal with that. It would have been a fairly big reallocation with a very big hiring policy to deal with the numbers of claims—to examine them and, in the current context, to allow the appeals through the system. The Government is making a constructive attempt to look at the refugee situation. Broadly, we have to deal with the whole of administrative law. It cannot be somehow severed and ignored as part of a different system.

         Another aspect of this Bill deals with the Indonesian fishermen. It is interesting to note that the main spur for the current inquiry into our relations with Indonesia by the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was, believe it or not, not Timor, not human rights in Indonesia, but concern about this problem in our northern waters. On 15 April, Mr Mark Sullivan, a First Assistant Secretary in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, appeared before the Committee. I think it is fair to say that some aspects of his evidence were of concern. There probably were things that could not be easily overcome, such as the to some degree conflicting roles of fisheries and immigration in the policy area, and the fact that we have different State jurisdictions covering the detention of these people. He made the point, which this Government is now attempting to tackle with this legislation when, as recorded at page 629 of the

         It was of concern in that inquiry that there were no statistics with regard to minors or repeat offenders, and that is a situation that the Committee will be looking at. The Department argued, and quite rightly, that treating these people differently from the rest of those imprisoned in Australia by saying that they alone would not be paid or that they would receive smaller payments would bring into the system a degree of discrimination. That was obviously not a road that the Government could go down.

         The third aspect of the legislation concerns the business migration program. As mentioned earlier, a large ingredient in this area comes from the review by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. That Committee made a series of recommendations in June of last year, which include the following:

       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee also tackled the question of accredited agents, which the Government took back. But more particularly we found in that report a concern that there was not proper monitoring of the people; that money was not being effectively put into business in Australia; that there was no growth in employment as a result of this policy area; and the reasons why this particular section of the immigration programs were not being fulfilled. At page 37, the Public Accounts Committee said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Equally, the lack of comprehensive data on the BMP's effectiveness has also affected business migrants. Impediments to business migrants establishing or expanding businesses which would achieve the BMP's goals were not identified which meant that suitable steps could not be taken to assist business migrants in those areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is another aspect of it. There was a lack of criteria. There was a lack of data on how businesses had succeeded and what areas were failures; whether there was any previous business expertise overseas; and whether there were particular industries where business migrants had been successful. All of that could not be detected and could not be established because of the paucity of monitoring that occurred.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee acknowledged at page 32 that a 1990 MSJ Keys Young Planners Pty Ltd survey of 160 migrants who entered Australia between 1984 and 1987 showed that 66 per cent of them were in business and employed, on average, 10 people. There was that kind of unsatisfactory mixed evidence that in sectors of the intake for migrant business there were successes, but on the whole this was one of the areas where the Committee was concerned about the monitoring. It was not just the central worry that some people were beating the system; that they were coming here supposedly transferring money, supposedly setting up businesses and not going through with them. There was this concern that we really could not guide them, that we really could not indicate whether we should alter the program or bring a different mix to it to make it more successful. The Committee goes on to say:

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee considers monitoring should have been a critical ingredient in evaluating whether this campaign has been effective, and whether business migrants had, in fact, established businesses. It is a matter of concern that such a promotional program was undertaken without the implementation of a monitoring scheme and that such a scheme was not developed and implemented until July 1980.

        So what we have in this legislation—as well as requirements concerning actions of the Minister—is an attempt to ensure that people comply with the requirements of the Department in providing evidence of what they have done. The Minister has the power to enforce their departure from Australia if they do not comply, so there is the groundwork for some efficiency in ensuring that people fulfil the requirements, that we gain something from this, that it is not just another way for someone's cousin or someone else who five years previously made some fake refugee claim to come into the country. There are the ingredients in this legislation for the Minister to more closely monitor the outcome and to ensure that its requirements are fulfilled.

       <para first-indent="16">

         As has been mentioned, another ingredient of the Bill is a clause which ensures that there can be quicker processing of some applicants by referring to the original decision maker without putting the case on hold for six months or whatever while his advice is sought. The legislation attempts to do something about the refugee intake. It attempts to ensure that people do not obtain a greater stay in the country by failing to fulfil departmental requirements. It tries to put Australia's refugee program in the context of international pressure. It attempts to ensure that illegal fishermen from Indonesia do not have a financial incentive to break Australia's laws and, of course, it does something about business migration.

         It is all right to say that there is a peculiarity in this portfolio, that it has broken down because of a few personalities, because of this or that person in the Department, et cetera, but it is part of a broad context. When we are examining how long things take, we should keep in mind the lack of review of the first boat people coming to this country. I do not think the current Minister was a very big player in that decision process. We are talking about what is happening now, but if we go back in history we can question the effectiveness of the interviewing of those people to see whether they were bona fide refugees. As I say, it is not just a five-minute problem that has hit this country.

We carry some hundreds of Bills, in no small measure due to the discipline with which we debate them. As a result of that, we have an effective legislature. The Americans consider themselves lucky to be able to get 20 or 30 pieces of legislation through a year. As a result, their legislation becomes increasingly ridiculous, because effectively the only way to govern the country is to keep tacking unrelated matters onto Bills that might have some chance, in an omnibus fashion, of finding their way through Congress.

         I think that that is a travesty of what the Parliament is supposed to be. The Parliament is supposed to be a debating chamber which visits on both sides of the Parliament an opportunity to explore legislation in reasonable detail, to present arguments, and to move amendments, for example, in committee. In committee we have the opportunity to scrutinise particular sections of the legislation, to suggest amendments and to test the Government and its advisers on matters that they are putting forward in the legislation. The guillotine motion denies that to us. Of course, that is why we object to it.

         Earlier in the week when the guillotine motion was moved for the first time, it related to a range of Bills primarily in the primary industry area. I pointed out some figures. The Leader of the House is correct when he says that the use of the device of declaring Bills urgent has increased. But the quantum of that increase, I think, needs to be repeated. In 1991, 101 Bills were declared urgent and, therefore, had the guillotine applied to them. But if we go back to the beginning of the Hawke-Keating leadership of this country in 1983-84, we see that there was about one. So there has been a rapid and dramatic increase. The graph grows tremendously.

         I also point out, as I did earlier in the week, that while the honourable member for Swan has been the Leader of the House he seems to have increased the use of the guillotine more so than any of his predecessors as Leader of the House. As I said to him earlier in the week, if we look at the period from 1976 to 1982, when there were 17 declarations of urgent Bills, and from 1983 to 1991, when 401 Bills have been declared urgent and had the guillotine applied, we will see that it is time for the Parliament to pause a little and wonder whether enough is enough. I think it is very important for the Government and the Parliament to take account of what is happening and the way in which this guillotine is being imposed.

         It is not sufficient for the Leader of the House to say that people from other countries are impressed with the expedition with which we deal with legislation. He provided the example of telecommunications legislation. There is very clear evidence that the reason why that was dealt with expeditiously is that he had a very sensible and balanced counterpart on the other side of the chamber. Because we had an exposure draft of that legislation and it was in the community for a long period, there was an opportunity to debate in detail those particular amendments to very complex legislation. It meant that at the end of the day we knew where the differences were and we were able to debate and improve the legislation. That was an exercise in how this Parliament ought to work.

If we have a look at Question Time, we can see that the number of questions that are being asked has diminished in recent years, and the time taken to answer those questions has indeed increased. What effectively has happened is that the Government is taking longer and longer to answer questions. Those who have started to watch the televising and round-ups of parliamentary proceedings will know that we rarely see Opposition members at the dispatch box in Question Time because that is the opportunity for members of the Government to put their views. If they are taking longer to answer questions, and answering fewer of them, then the effectiveness and importance of Parliament is being diminished in favour of the Executive. I think we have to be a little more cognisant of the institution in which we work and show it a little more respect.

That is a tragedy. What we want in this country is a healthy, vibrant democracy, and the symbol of it in this country is this chamber.

Therein lies the solution to this problem: getting the Government's Ministers to prepare their legislation in accordance with the demands of the Senate so that we can get it in here and deal with it in the proper fashion. We do not think that legislation by exhaustion in the early hours of the morning is good for our health, but, more importantly, it is not good for the nation.

We heard him once again go through his tired old reasoning. He omitted to mention that it is within the province of the Government to extend the sittings during sitting weeks and thus enable important legislation such as that which is proposed to be guillotined tonight to have a full airing, with the possible benefit to the Government that we can improve its legislation. That is not hard with taxation law, as we will mention probably later in debates on the legislation itself, because we so often see tax legislation in particular coming through this chamber, often but not necessarily guillotined, finding its way up to the Senate and then having to come back here to have obvious errors corrected, errors which could have been examined and exposed in this place before they left the chamber to go to the Senate.

         The Leader of the House must convince listeners that he is not embarrassed by the position he is in. What we have had is Beazleyspeak at its worst, and we hear it time and time again towards the end of sessions—both Autumn and Budget—of this Parliament. His view is consistent with that of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), who is also at the table. He represented the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)—who does not come in here to discuss important tax legislation—and was involved in the second reading speeches of much of the legislation which is to be guillotined tonight. The Minister giggled and sighed his way through the second reading speeches and, at one stage, even suggested that perhaps he could table them.

         The actions of that particular Minister on more than one occasion suggest that he does not understand what he is putting to this chamber on behalf of the Government. Just a couple of weeks ago, he lamented the fact that he had not received information from the Taxation Institute of Australia on other very important tax legislation which was before the chamber. In fact, there was a note of criticism in his voice and even a little hurt that he had not been told of the attitude of one of the foremost bodies examining, reacting to, administering, informing, and advising others on, tax law in this country.

         That body will not have had any opportunity to do that with these laws tonight, because most of this legislation was introduced only two days ago on Tuesday of this sitting week. This gave us two days to examine 1,500 pages of new tax legislation. The Opposition has had access to drafts of some of this legislation since late last week, but this does not obviate the fact that we have had virtually no time at all to give this legislation the detailed consideration that even the Government would surely concede that it deserves.

         Taking in 1,500 pages of legislation in two days is an impossible task. Perhaps in recognition of this, the Government has this week applied the guillotine to the remainder of its legislative program for this sitting, curtailing debate on these, and other, important Bills. It turns out that we could not have debated this legislation meaningfully and fully, even if it had been introduced weeks or months ago, because the Government was always going to chop it and apply the guillotine.

         The Government introduced its Bills at a snail's pace at the beginning of the year. But there was a marvellous innovation. Presumably at the initiative of the Leader of the House, we were given a draft program of his legislation earlier in the sitting. That was not worth the paper it was written on. I think it should be referred to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) because it was simply a waste of paper. And it was a waste of our time also.

Surely I cannot be blamed for reaching the conclusion that it is because the Government cannot debate the legislation in this chamber.

         In the first two weeks that I was here last year there were no fewer than 33 Bills guillotined through the House. In these two weeks of this session, as happens in the autumn session each year, we are again seeing a similar number of Bills being guillotined through the House. As other members have pointed out, the legislation which is being guillotined through the House is of considerable importance to all Australians. It has been indicated that taxation legislation, running to some 1,500 pages, was provided to most members of this House only a couple of days ago—they would have an impossible task even reading it and the explanatory memorandum, let alone understanding the complexity of it—yet it is being forced through under guillotine tonight.

Concern is often expressed about the cost of justice and the volume of legislation that this Parliament deals with.

I can understand why, perhaps, this Government does not want to debate these sorts of issues and let the Australian people know the rip-off that has been going on. It is simply not good enough. I believe that if we all go back to our electorates and ask ordinary Australians on the street what they expect of their parliamentarians, one thing they will say is that, when their members of parliament wish to address important legislation, they ought to have the opportunity to do so. Short of some real explanation and some good reason, other than that it happened in the past, it is simply not good enough to say to them, `Well, we have to push it through because that is the requirement of the Senate', or, `It was done this way in the past and we are no worse off than we were at some other time'.

         The problem is multiplied by the volume of legislation. In a recent report by the Administrative Review Council, which looked into rule making by Commonwealth agencies, it was pointed out that the project was undertaken because of concern about the proliferation of subordinate instruments of law, which numbered 248 in 1970, rising to 793 in 1982-83, and rising to 1,424 in 1990. In 1990-91 the total number of statutory rules and disallowable instruments of the Commonwealth Parliament was recorded as being 1,645. This whole layer of subordinate legislation, which is based on and implemented pursuant to the laws passed by this Parliament, has multiplied over the last eight to 10 years. That situation is simply not addressed in any real way by the Parliament. It is to the credit of the Administrative Review Council that it has brought this matter not only to the attention of members of parliament but also to the attention of the general public.

When the leading parliamentary chamber had made its decisions, they were there to check out the fine print, to give it a brief looking over to make sure. What have we done to the House of Representatives by these processes? By denying the opportunity for debate we are saying—and I think it is becoming commonly recognised—that the Senate is now the place where the true decisions are being made.

         I think this is outrageous. I just wonder what the people who sit on the front benches in this chamber believe they are doing. That is bad enough, but it is extended in so many other ways. The debate about Question Time is now in the media every day because it is seen as being abused, it is being seen as some sort of picture show. I do not know why we do not put masks over the doors and call it the something or other theatre. We would like an opportunity to ask a question of the Government to which we might get an answer, such as: `How are the finances this week, Treasurer?'. The people might like to know. We cannot get any answers about that. If we were to stand up here and ask any question about where the Government was going in terms of taxing the people, we would be told about how the Opposition proposes to tax the people. Again, it is a denigration of the process; it is dragging the reputation of this House down. I cannot understand it.

         I think that, somewhere in the back of our minds, we still believe that this is the principal chamber of the Parliament, of the whole property. Yet we are constantly denied the opportunity to debate issues; we are constantly denied the opportunity to question the Government on the issues that matter to the people. The Government is only partly concerned with what is going on with the Opposition; it is very concerned with what is going on today.

         It was surprising to see the last appointed Minister today, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), a lady who has been charged in this Parliament with protecting the rights of consumers, saying, `Really and truly, I know that is my job, but I am really here to try to win the next election'. In other words, she has her priorities worked out—there are no worries about the consumers, unless in some way it can be presented to them in a picture that makes them vote for this particular Labor Party. I think that is pretty tragic. It is all an indictment on us in this place. It is about time we started to think about what we might do.

         When it comes down to the administration of this place, when someone is preparing 1,500 pages of legislation, it is not just a flash of inspiration; it is not just that someone thought, `I will do a rewrite of the sales tax legislation and we will rush that into the Parliament next week'. I would imagine that the gestation period of this legislation has been months and months and that the physical effort of writing it must have taken a period of that order. So why does it suddenly have to be dumped in the Parliament and rushed through in a couple of hours? Why does the Government insult us? Why does it insult itself?

         This legislation is extremely important legislation. A call came to my office the other day from a representative of one of the major fuel companies. The company's rough estimate—made after getting hold of a draft or something—is that its tax liabilities will be increased by about $1.3m. Companies say they cannot get answers from the office of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) because that office does not return their phone calls. It does not look as if we have much chance of getting an answer for them in the time that has been made available to us. I am not sure that we even understand the complexity of their problem. But that is what we are supposed to be here for. This is the House of Representatives. Those words have a meaning. They mean representing people and their needs and ensuring that legislation that is brought to the Parliament and passed is in their best interest, whatever that may be.

         It is interesting that I frequently find myself on my feet in Question Time referring to Standing Orders. One of the Standing Orders says that we are not to ask questions about debates in the current session. We are denied the right to say to a Minister or the Treasurer, `You have these 1,500 pages of legislation floating around. Could you tell us how this bit works?'. We are supposed to do that in the parliamentary debate.

         It used to be the practice that when a matter of such importance as this legislation was being debated, the Minister himself—the Treasurer in this case—would be present for the debate. I might say that I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for his attendance in the House while his legislation is being debated. But too many of the other Ministers do not sit through the debate. They do not know the concerns that are expressed and they are unable to be questioned on what the legislation is all about. I think the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) got that right. There is a simple reason for that: they do not know what it is all about, nor do they care.

         The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has made me make this point before. I do not know who gets ambushed worse by these sorts of proposals. I still hold to the theory that there is a degree of bureaucratic conspiracy in this, but that is the fault of government. If the Government cannot get its legislation up in time, it is very simple for it to tell the bureaucracy that it will wait until the next sittings. That would improve its efforts no end.

         It is about time the Government let some of its own side ask a question on their own. I cannot remember the last time anyone on the Government side did anything other than ask a dorothy dix question. People have been talking about their history in this place. When we were in government, very seldom would a backbencher ask a dorothy dixer. I used to see the odd one come up—it was easier in those days because there were longer benches and the question would be slid along. We protected our right to represent our constituents. It is about time the Government got back to that. I will not take up any more of the House's time, but I hope some notice will be taken of what I have said, in the interests of the reputation of this House and the interests of the people of Australia.

         —in reply—We may have discovered some unusual allies in this debate. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made some comments about Question Time. He may not know that some time ago there was an offer made to the Opposition for a change in Question Time which I think would have been very much of value to this chamber. We suggested we should move over to the British mode, in which we would not have a Prime Minister's Question Time every day, which is what Question Time has become; we would have a Question Time which would put Ministers under the drum in serried lots, as do the British, on each day, with the Prime Minister coming up perhaps once a week for a period in Question Time. That would permit scrutiny of Ministers and scrutiny of government in a way that we do not have at present. The simple fact is that the Opposition is generally only interested in asking political point scoring questions at Question Time, and Government members tend to respond in kind. As a result of that, I agree with the honourable member that precious little scrutiny of government goes on in Question Time.

         That offer was made by the Government to the Opposition and it was turned down. Whilst I do not hold the honourable member for O'Connor responsible for that, I do hold his leadership responsible. It was a genuine offer made to improve the effectiveness of this Parliament, and it was dismissed. We will not alter Question Time unilaterally. If the Opposition says to us that it does not want that to happen, we will respect the Opposition's wishes in that regard, and we have done so. For the benefit of this chamber and its effectiveness, it was a great opportunity lost, and it will be so recorded in the annals of this Parliament.

         As for dorothy dixers, I think it must be at least 12 months since I have sat here and seen anyone other than the designated member of the Opposition rise when a question is being asked in this chamber. I do not know what rights the honourable member for O'Connor insists on in government, but he clearly does not insist on the same rights in opposition when he finds himself there. It is either that or we are expected to assume that the honourable member for O'Connor wishes to ask no questions in this place. That would be an interesting thing for his constituents to know.

         On the question of the House of Representatives, I agree with the honourable member for O'Connor that we have a problem in this area. We are the premier chamber, but we are dictated to by the Senate. The Senate announces to us that it will consider none of our legislation in this sittings beyond tonight. The situation that that places us in is that the Government has a choice to either let the legislation run on for six months or bring it to a conclusion now. I think it is obvious that, if we operated under the old system that existed prior to 1987, this Parliament in this sittings probably would have another three or four weeks to run. It does not have that, basically because there is no point to it in terms of the legislative program. If that is a genuine concern, I think pressure can be placed back on the senators, both those in Opposition and in Government, to change their practices in that regard.

         There would be a way of avoiding the stringency of this guillotine, although probably not the guillotine itself, because when the Opposition was in office, whilst it did not resort so heavily to guillotine, it certainly resorted to closure, which we do not. If the Opposition does want to do that, it needs to bear in mind that we do have much more time in parliament made available to private members representing their constituents' interests than we historically have had. In fact, infinitely more time is available to members of parliament than was the practical case, and even the Standing Orders case, prior to 1987.

         That is at least as important as the scrutiny of Bills. However, the scrutiny of Bills is important. I cannot think of one major piece of legislation that I have carried through this place when I have not accepted Opposition amendments to it. Therefore, it is in all our interests to try to get a different practice out of the Senate to allow us a little more time in each session to consider the legislation.

         —The House has before it the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2.), the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill and the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill. In respect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the self-assessment Bill the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) will put the Opposition's views on the record. I will confine my remarks to the Taxation Administration Amendment Bill, which proposes to provide certain access to tax information for the WA Royal Commission into certain matters of corruption, otherwise known as the corruption commission into WA Inc. The coalition's position is not to oppose the Bill but to state clearly a case for a different treatment of the access being provided to the Royal Commission by the Australian Taxation Office in respect of certain tax files. This matter comes as a result of a request from the Royal Commission in Western Australia to the Federal Government that the Federal Government amend the law as necessary to ensure that the Western Australian commission had full access to the information it needed to pursue the terms of reference of its inquiry into WA Inc.

         It became publicly known recently, when the WA Royal Commission let it be known, in the words of Mr Templeman, as counsel assisting the inquiry, that the Federal Government, and in particular the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), had denied the Western Australian corruption commission access to information in respect of certain tax matters. In Mr Templeman's presentation to the Royal Commission, he made the very simple point that in refusing access the Government had taken a different attitude to the one it had taken in the Fitzgerald inquiry conducted in Queensland.

         At its most simple, the truth of the matter is that, when we first heard about it, the Government had provided access to tax information to the Fitzgerald inquiry into the National Party in Queensland, and the door was wide open. The Government said, `Have whatever you need to pursue the National Party in Queensland'. Yet, when access was sought by the Western Australian commission into WA Inc. and Labor's mates, the door was closed firmly in its face. So Mr Templeman made the point. A press report in the

        When it came to the Government looking after its mates in the WA Inc. inquiry, the door was firmly shut; when it came to getting stuck into the National Party in Queensland, the present Prime Minister was happy to give the Fitzgerald inquiry all the access that it needed.

         Let me go back in time to present to the House a clear chronology of what has happened on this policy issue over recent years. I go back to 1982 when the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No.2) was passed, which empowered the Commissioner of Taxation to pass tax information to the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions and to any other Federal royal commission that the Governor-General declared in its terms of reference should have access. If we go back to 1982, we will see that the law was changed to provide full access to a royal commission `for the purposes of conducting its inquiry'. That was the clear legislatively stated policy position of the Commonwealth for royal commissions: to provide access for the purposes of conducting the inquiries of those royal commissions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In 1987 in respect of the Fitzgerald inquiry, as I have already mentioned, a similar need was seen and the Government then provided access to the Fitzgerald commission `for the purposes of the inquiry'. In addition, limitations were imposed on the Royal Commission restricting communication of such tax information other than for law enforcement purposes. We have a clear policy position for the Costigan and Stewart royal commissions in 1982 flowing through to 1987 in respect of the Fitzgerald inquiry.

         In 1989 there was another change to the law when section 3E was inserted into the Taxation Administration Act to grant access to tax information to all Australian police forces, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Securities Commission. The royal commissions had access to tax information for the purposes of their inquiries.

         In 1989, when the law was changed again, access was given but on a more restricted basis. It was ongoing access and the restriction was in the following terms. Access was limited to cases where `the commissioner'—that is, the Tax Commissioner—`is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence was or is being committed'. Access was provided, but with that additional qualification and limit at the discretion of the Commissioner.

         That section was further amended in 1991 to extend that limited form of access—not the general access provided previously to royal commissions—to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the ICAC in New South Wales and the New South Wales Crime Commission. Following that, also in 1991, as I have quoted from the press report and the minute from the Australian Taxation Office, the WA Royal Commission sought the same access as Fitzgerald had obtained. On three occasions, the first by the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, that access was rejected. In a statement to the Royal Commission, Mr Templeman confirmed those facts.

         On 14 May when it became publicly known that the present Prime Minister had used his position when Treasurer to block access to tax information for the WA Inc. inquiry—I say it was for the very obvious reason that he was looking after his mates—he held a press conference at which he attacked the WA Royal Commission. In fact, he rejected the suggestion that the Government had `impeded the ability of the WA commission to obtain tax information'.

         As events unfolded, within 24 hours the Prime Minister had to admit that his statement was wrong about the legislative framework within which the WA Royal Commission was operating and through which access may or may not have been provided. It was patently clear to everyone, including the Prime Minister, that his statement on 14 May was wrong. In support of his position, the Prime Minister argued that the Fitzgerald exercise—granting access for the purposes of the inquiry—was not a precedent and was justified in 1987 `because of the dividend in uncovering tax evasion'. He said that the WA commission already had a right to access tax information through the Western Australian police unit attached to it.

         The WA Royal Commission asserted that it could not validly access tax information via the police unit, and there were a number of independent commentators who supported that view. On 15 May 1992 the Prime Minister announced an amendment to section 3E to remove doubt about the WA Commission's right of access to tax information. The access that was sought was the same as was provided to the Stewart Royal Commission, the Costigan Royal Commission and the Fitzgerald inquiry. The access now being provided by the Government is not the same as was provided to those three previous commissions; it is the more limited access provided generally to law enforcement authorities.

         This is the first occasion that the access powers of a royal commission have in fact been limited. The wording of section 16, which was inserted back in 1982, by its reference to other royal commissions, clearly indicates an intention that such bodies should have access for the purpose of their inquiries. The subsequent insertion of a limited access arrangement—that is, section 3E—for law enforcement agencies simply reinforces the argument.

         On the argument about revenue dividend, all the evidence suggests that the potential for revenue collection through the WA Royal Commission far exceeds that in the case of the Fitzgerald inquiry. One only has to have some idea of what went on with WA Inc and Rothwells and all the wheeling and dealing that has surrounded that incredible saga of corruption in WA to appreciate that simple point.

         The Prime Minister, clutching at straws, looking for every argument that he could find to justify the unjustifiable position that he had, also claimed that the provision of information to the WA commission would somehow be a breach of privacy and that it was not just a commission following its terms of reference but somehow it was on a wild fishing expedition, and he pictured lawyers travelling around the countryside with their bags full of tax information.

         Not only is that not true, but it is also an insult to the Commissioners of the WA Royal Commission, including Sir Roland Wilson, a former High Court judge and a person whose authority and integrity, I am sure, not even the Prime Minister would directly question. The truth of the matter is that the WA Royal Commission is constrained by its terms of reference and, furthermore, the communication of any information which comes to it is also constrained by Federal law.

         The Prime Minister also refers in his arguments to comments made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) back in 1989 on the introduction of section 3E. When we look at it, we see what a superficial argument the Prime Minister put by way of defence of his actions in this case. I have the reference to

         The only conclusion that one can draw from a fairly analytical review of the facts of this matter is that the whole exercise has been tainted by the Government's political bias. The facts are that when it came to Queensland, the Government was prepared to open the doors for information in respect of tax files from the Tax Commissioner so that the royal commission in that case could comprehensively follow its terms of reference and, in particular, follow the money trail, which is so often a characteristic of corruption inquiries.

         In respect of WA Inc., the reality is that the request was the same, yet it was denied. Having looked at all the Government's arguments for refusing access, one can only conclude that it had a political bias to it and this Federal Labor Government was more interested in looking after its mates than in maintaining a consistent position in terms of making access available to the WA Royal Commission.

         Whilst Mr Templeman of the WA Royal Commission made his remarks publicly concerning the refusal of the Government to provide access, it is true—and I am sure Government speakers will make the point—that since the matter came to public notice the Government has sat down and had discussions with the WA Royal Commission, and the Commission, through its solicitor, has provided a letter to the Government which accepts the amendments which have been provided and which are now before the House.

         I myself have no information upon which to judge the manner in which the WA Royal Commission has formed this view. The only information that I have on the public record is that it specifically asked for access on the same basis as was provided to Fitzgerald and, as is clear from the legislation, that has been denied it, and a limited form of access has found its way into this amendment Bill.

         The Opposition, therefore, whilst not opposing the Bill, foreshadows that in the other place we will introduce an amendment so that the access being provided is in exactly the same terms as was provided to Fitzgerald. I believe that on this occasion the Government's political bias in looking after its mates has been revealed for all to see. It is true that the Government backed down when the full glare of public attention was brought to bear on the issue. But the reality is that all we have is a tactical withdrawal, not full compliance with the original request from the WA Commission.

         The only explanation I could come to in respect of the WA Commission's attitude in the matter is that, following a comprehensive review of the evidence, it has a fair amount of material on which one could base a case that a serious offence has been committed; in which case it has perhaps got as much as it currently believes is necessary to proceed further within the terms of reference. It is, however, a classic case study of the way in which this Government operates. It should have been  virtually an automatic process for the Government to comply with the request from the WA Royal Commission to provide it with the same access as was given to Fitzgerald.

         It was knocked back within the Treasurer's office. I might say by way of contrast that, whereas in the case of Fitzgerald it was subject to a Cabinet submission, on this occasion it went through the Treasurer's office, and only through his office, and was dealt with at a political level and, as we see publicly revealed now, dealt with in a very political way. The Government ought to provide the same access to the WA Commission as it provided to the Fitzgerald inquiry. In the Senate we will move accordingly.

         The theme running through his particular contribution is that the Government has been involved in some sort of conspiracy in terms of the access by the Western Australian Royal Commission to taxation records in order to protect so-called mates. In support of his case he went through a chronological order of events in history—from Costigan through to this particular request for information from the Western Australian Royal Commission. He concluded, from what he described as his analytical approach, that the only conclusion to be drawn is that the old mates were going to be protected by the refusal of a succession of Treasurers—in fact, three Treasurers in total refused access—and that meant there would have to be some conspiracy involved.

         While he attempted to provide some analytical information, he did not provide to the House the advice which the Taxation Commissioner had provided to the Treasurers on each occasion. I suppose the Taxation Commissioner, Mr Boucher, has to be part of the conspiracy for all the pieces to really fit together. For this conspiracy to have some legs, I think we would have to see the Taxation Commissioner advising the Treasurer, `Yes, the access to the information should be provided, and I recommend that you provide it', and then the Treasurer saying, `No, I am not going to accept the advice from my Taxation Commissioner. I am going to go against that advice from the independent commissioner and refuse to give access'. Of course, that was not the case at all. These rather salient points were not canvassed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his contribution.

         When Mr Boucher was involved in this particular attempt by the Royal Commission to get information, his advice to the Treasurer was that the information required could be supplied under the law as it stood. When it all boils down, and we start divorcing ourselves from conspiracy theories and everything else which flows from that, the reality of the situation is that there has been a difference of opinion between the lawyers attached to the Royal Commission and the lawyers attached to the Taxation Commissioner as to the operation of the existing provisions in the Act, which we are tonight amending. It is simply because there has been a difference in the opinion as to whether the access should be provided.

There has been a dispute as to whether the information required by the Royal Commission can be provided. This particular Bill is before the House in order to resolve that dispute. There is no conspiracy involved; there is no cover-up involved; there is no protection of mates or anything else. It is quite an extraordinary outcome to a so-called conspiracy that we are here tonight debating proposals which give the Royal Commission the access it wants. We have a letter, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition alluded to, from the Royal Commission saying that not only has it been involved with the drafting of this particular Bill—it is in terms which make sure that it gets the information it wants—but it is also satisfied with the outcome, and the information it seeks will flow to it.

         The two other Bills in this package are extremely important. In essence, they give effect to some of the measures announced in the One Nation statement. Time will not permit me tonight to canvass them in detail. However, I will speak for a few minutes on them. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill is a step to consolidate the credibility of the Australian income tax system. This credibility has largely been restored by the tax reform agenda of this Government which has been a constant program since 1983. It has seen the elimination of various tax rorts, the bringing in and broadening of the tax base with measures such as capital gains tax, fringe benefits taxation, substantiation provisions, and the concept of self-assessment on behalf of taxpayers.

         This process of self-assessment has generally been very successful. I think most taxpayers would now be quite familiar with the way the system works, if they calculate their own taxation, when they submit their return. That system is supported by a process of random audits on behalf of the Taxation Commissioner. This particular amendment consolidates that process. It brings in a new system for calculating whether a taxpayer was acting reasonably in determining whether a deduction should have been claimed or income should have been included. I suppose the down side of the system of self-assessment is that there is always some scope for people to not quite completely or accurately submit their returns. On occasions, this can lead to either a great underestimation of income or a great overestimation of allowable deductions. These laws will clarify how those procedures should be handled and, for that reason, they are to be commended.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with a range of business friendly taxation measures, and they are not imposing great imposts, as has been claimed by some of the earlier contributions I heard today. One important measure introduces the announcement in the One Nation statement concerning goodwill for small business and the taxation of capital gains. I think most honourable members would be familiar with a fairly constant criticism from the small business community concerning the taxation of capital gains tax, particularly when the business is onsold and the proceeds from the sale are invested in another business.

         The Government will allow that process to continue with these taxation reforms; that is, it will allow the money to be reinvested in a new small business up to a certain threshold level. The system already has a CPI indexation built into the calculation. Further, this new system allows the calculation of goodwill and a write-off of goodwill in terms of the calculation of capital gains tax. That is an extremely worthwhile measure to be condoned in the tax laws.

         Further, there are amendments to the depreciation scheduling for business. This will give Australia a world class system of depreciation. It means that businesses have a great incentive to invest and will be able to write-off the investment in new plant and equipment over a much quicker timeframe. These are extremely valuable pro-business measures which are to be complimented.

They are sensible reforms and they will do a lot to clarify the taxation situation and also bring in some much needed reforms in terms of the operation of business in Australia.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) implements a number of the decisions announced in the Government's `One Job' economic statement earlier this year and introduces a number of miscellaneous amendments to the tax laws. The Bill makes changes in the areas of depreciation allowance, deferral of company tax, capital gains tax, research and development expenditure, foreign source income and deductions for contributions to superannuation funds. There are also a number of provisions dealing with the taxation of pay and allowances for our Defence Force personnel now serving in Cambodia.

         With depreciation allowances, the Bill provides for higher depreciation rates for plant and equipment with an effective life of five or more years, reducing the period in which such items can be written off by taxpayers. The Bill sets out the new rates schedule by which items can be depreciated once the effective life for an asset has been determined. Under the new schedule there are to be six depreciation rates rather than the seven broad banded rates now applicable.

         There has been much uncertainty generated by the Government's continued tinkering with the depreciation provisions of the tax laws. We have seen such tinkering in the March 1991 industry policy statement, the details of which were to be found in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1991 which we dealt with in this place just a few weeks ago. Those arrangements were then supplemented by those contained in the `One Job' statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February which were announced the very day after we had debated the measures that were announced in the March 1991 industry policy statement and contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4).

However, given the uncertainty that has been caused by the Government's continued tinkering with depreciation arrangements, the coalition has committed itself in our Fightback package to a full review of whatever depreciation arrangements may be in place when we assume office. Our review will aim to increase the incentives for business to invest in new plant and equipment and thereby promote our future growth potential and international competitiveness. Provision will be made by us to allow for the faster write-off of certain types of assets where that is deemed to be appropriate to encourage more productive investment in Australia.

         Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) also provides for the deferral of the initial payment of company tax by small business for the 1991-92 income year. Companies with a tax liability of under $400,000 and which pay their tax in two instalments will have the date of their initial payment deferred by nine weeks from the twenty-eighth day of the month following the balance date to the twenty-eighth day of the third month following the balance date. These amendments will result in the deferral of some $10m in tax revenue.

         The measure should provide some welcome cash flow relief for struggling small businesses around the country. However, it is only partial compensation for the Government's previous decisions to bring forward the collection of company tax receipts by changes to the company tax payment system. This system has resulted in many companies going broke because of an inability to meet the payments the Government brought forward through its previous changes to the company tax payment system. These changes to the collection of company tax had no purpose other than to pad out the Government's Budget surpluses of a few years ago, so the provisions of this Bill should not be looked upon as any great concession but more as a partial correction of previous wrongs.

         This Bill will also increase the capital gains tax exemption on the sale of goodwill by small business from 20 per cent to 50 per cent for disposals of goodwill that occur after 26 February 1992. The new exemption level will apply to taxpayers whose net business interests are worth up to $2m rather than the old threshold of $1m. In addition, the new exemption threshold is now to be the subject of annual indexation to maintain the value of the threshold in line with the consumer price index, beginning in the income year 1993-94. If it is to be deferred for so long, one wonders about the sincerity of the Government. We know that it cannot meet the projected tax cuts it promised in its `One Job' statement and this seems like a pointless gesture.

         The Government has made a cynical attempt to one-up the coalition with some belated goodwill relief by appearing to match our threshold of $2m and provide a flat rate of relief of 50 per cent rather than the coalition's more equitable proposal of a sliding scale of relief ranging from 50 per cent down to 10 per cent. In fact, the Government's $2m threshold for goodwill relief is not nearly as generous as that proposed by the coalition since it is based on net business interests rather than just the value of the goodwill itself. The goodwill relief contained in this legislation is just another con job in the field of taxation and is indicative of the depths to which the Government will stoop to hoodwink the small business community.

         Measures to be adopted by the coalition will result in a much simpler and fairer capital gains tax system in contrast to the administrative nightmare and fundamental inequities imposed on taxpayers by this Government and from which there is no substantial relief to be found in this Bill. This is despite the finding of the Government's very own Beddall report on small business in Australia which called for `capital gains tax to be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business'. The Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) has simply been ignored by his own Government when it comes to the taxation of capital gains and the provision of roll-over relief.

         —The honourable member for Forrest has made a study of the subject. In light of the changes to be made to the capital gains tax legislation by the provisions in this Bill, the Government needs to address the current constitutional status of the capital gains tax in the light of recent High Court of Australia decisions. There have been two major decisions recently in the High Court with capital gains tax implications. Both decisions found in favour of the two taxpayers concerned, namely, Mutual Pools and the South Australian Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. Both decisions cast doubt upon the validity of the capital gains tax given the provisions of sections 114 and 55 of the Constitution.

         These problems would not have arisen had the original capital gains tax legislation been carefully drafted, but in the Government's rush to get that legislation through at the time it landed us collectively with what may well be a fatally flawed tax that will require retrospective legislation to correct. Retrospective legislation would open a Pandora's box of problems for those many taxpayers already assessed for capital gains tax under what may have been all along constitutionally invalid imposts. Before the Government proceeds with any changes to the capital gains tax, I think we are entitled to hear the Government's legal advice concerning this tax, since it may have major implications for many taxpayers.

This exemption is to be backdated also, this time to 9 June 1991. However, it appears that it is the Government's intention to terminate this exemption once the UN declares a cease-fire in Cambodia, despite the fact that Australian forces will still be subject to considerable personal danger in conducting their peacekeeping activities. Once the cease-fire has been called, the salaries of ADF peacekeepers in Cambodia and their $60 Cambodia allowance will be taxed by the Government.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992 makes a number of changes to the system of self-assessment for income tax that we have had with us since 1986. For the most part, the proposed amendments represent improvements to the existing self-assessment system, which has been the source of numerous difficulties for so many taxpayers. These difficulties stem largely from the complexities of the Income Tax Assessment Act which makes it extremely difficult for taxpayers to self-assess their income tax liability without the expenditure of an enormous amount of time and effort, not to say financial cost. This has served to increase the compliance costs involved in the collection of tax revenue and hence the overall economic burden that tax laws impose on taxpayers in Australia. Indeed, a leaked Tax Office memorandum went so far as to claim that `the administrative savings from the existing self-assessment system may well have been outweighed by the revenue cost', that is, the cost to revenue of the compliance burden of taxation.

         Not only is the existing self-assessment system expensive but also it exposes taxpayers to considerable risk of error and subsequent penalty. The liability of taxpayers to penalties under the income tax law has not been changed to reflect the introduction of self-assessment so that taxpayers have become even more exposed to penalties. Also, the existence of wide-ranging discretionary powers on the part of the Tax Commissioner is totally at odds with a system of self-assessment. Taxpayers can hardly be expected to self-assess their liability to income tax when the Commissioner has sufficient latitude to take an entirely new position in respect of a given part of a tax law.

In relation to rulings there needs to be greater provision for taxpayers to seek a private ruling in the context of an audit by the Tax Office. Also, with rulings taking the form of de facto law making, there needs to be a general right of this Parliament to disallow rulings so that the Parliament's sovereignty in relation to the raising of taxes is not compromised by the activities of the Commissioner of Taxation, whether exercising his many discretions or otherwise.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) makes a number of changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. The definition of primary production for the purposes of the income tax law is to be expanded to include horticulture, including the propagation or cultivation of plants and their products at some minor cost to the revenue. A clarifying amendment is also introduced to confirm that prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum and natural gas will not count as research and development expenditure for the purpose of the 150 per cent tax deduction that is made available for such expenditure.

         The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) gives effect to debt equity swap measures announced in the `One Nation, One Job' statement, as well as clarifying the law on the deductibility of bad debts.

         These borrowings will not be assessable on the interest earned, and the interest paid by the borrower will not be tax deductible. However, the costs incurred by investors deriving interest on infrastructure borrowings will be tax deductible. Profits or gains arising from the disposal of securities that are infrastructure borrowings will be exempt from tax, while losses incurred by way of such disposals will not be tax deductible. The former investment allowance provisions that operated between 1976 and 1985 are reintroduced and amended to provide for the development allowance contained in the `One Job' but purported economic statement.

         The allowance gives a tax deduction of 10 per cent of capital expenditure on plant and equipment acquired for projects costing $50m or more, which meet also with certain other criteria. The allowance will apply when the plant is first used or installed ready for use. These provisions are designed, we are told, to work in tandem with the Development Allowance Authority Bill, which establishes a new authority that will administer the development allowance tax deduction. The Authority is to be established to determine whether the necessary criteria have been met for the granting of a development allowance. This will result in the Authority issuing a certificate enabling a deduction to be claimed under the tax provisions.

         While these changes to the tax laws are essentially unobjectionable, the same cannot be said of some of the Development Allowance Authority Bill and the Pooled Development Fund Bill. The Development Allowance Authority is to be established with a mandate to assess the eligibility of large projects with a total cost of $50m or more for development allowances. Eligible projects that the Authority will seek to promote will include factories, mines, quarries, wharves and other port facilities, hotels, pipelines and transport facilities.

         At the time of the `One Nation, One Job' statement there was no indication as to how the proposed development allowances were to be administered. There was certainly no mention of the establishment of a wholly new independent statutory authority, with a supporting secretariat, at a projected cost of $1.2m. This $1.2m authority will have responsibility for administering development allowances that will cost the revenue only $40m in 1994-95 and $70m in 1995-96. The body would not seem to be a very cost-effective quango on the basis of those estimates. One would expect that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce or Treasury would already have the ability to make these assessments without the necessity of introducing yet another bureaucratic authority.

         In any event, the whole conceptual basis for the development allowance and the Development Allowance Authority is flawed. In order to receive the allowance, projects must be shown to be world competitive—in the words of the `One Job' statement—in relation to the proposed practices of employers and employees and the practices of all levels of government under which they must operate.

         World competitive projects are to be identified on the basis of an absence of industry assistance or protection; positive facilitation by local and state governments, with the Commonwealth providing complementary action where required; and also world best practice in industrial relations. How is that for a bit of bureaucratese? We have a long way to go in Australia before we get to that point.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, all of this begs the question: why do these projects need special tax breaks if they are indeed already world competitive? World competitive projects run on the basis of best international practice should not require any assistance from the Commonwealth in the form of tax breaks which must be paid for, ultimately, by other taxpayers who will be required to bear a heavier tax burden. Of course, if these projects were less than world competitive we would be even less inclined to offer them such support from the taxpayers' purse.

         There is evidence, however, that the Government intends to use development allowances to do exactly that and support under-competitive projects through the Development Allowance Authority. For a start, the so-called competitive test is to be waived completely for the first round of applicants who apply before the end of 1992. The Government probably envisages a migrant scheme in the Marshall Islands. The way I read this Bill, that would qualify.

         —Yes I have. Mr Symons would do just as well under this scheme as he did from the patronage of the honourable member's mate, Senator Richardson. Furthermore, the criteria for the competitiveness test are given scant attention in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, although they are mentioned of course in the clauses of the legislation itself. This suggests that the Government will actually give little credence to the criteria in the memorandum when it comes to interpreting the legislation. The Minister noted in his second reading speech that the allowance will provide firms `with additional leverage to negotiate progress against a broad best practice agenda'. Again, this suggests that allowance recipients will be less than competitive at the time of granting the allowance.

         The Government has stated that the development allowances will not be allocated on the basis of preferred industry sectors and, therefore, will not benefit preferred projects or firms. But in making such bold statements, the Government is ignoring the fact that any such scheme inevitably requires judgments as to how these allowances are to be best allocated. The preferences and judgments of the bureaucrats making these decisions will inevitably enter into the equation so that the Government cannot avoid falling into the trap of picking winners through this legislation.

         There are further problems with the Bill. The total capital cost threshold of $50m is arbitrary and obviously highly distortionary. It will encourage the vertical integration of production processes for the purpose of claiming the allowance, even though such integration may not be optimal in terms of that particular production process. Highly efficient and productive capital projects, which just happen to have a total capital cost under the $50m threshold, will not qualify for any special allowance.

The Government has adopted a politically convenient damp squib approach to restoring business investment in this country—the very same business investment that it destroyed through the recession we had to have. If the Government were seriously concerned about providing for increased capital spending on the part of Australian business, it would address the full range of tax and industrial relations reform measures being proposed by the coalition in our Fightback package and elsewhere in our policies. The Government should lift the $20 billion in taxes from business, as proposed in the Fightback package. It should tackle the outrageous work practices that are crippling Australian industry.

It is more likely that we will see exactly the same investment patterns, but with a proportion of these funds being channelled through the PDFs to take advantage of the available tax concessions.

         The philosophy of Fightback, referred to a few moments ago by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher)—or `Setback', `Revertback' or whatever one wants to call it—is that everything should be taxed at the same rate, whether it be food or Ferraris, or clothing or caviar. It is a straight-out regressive taxation approach with the imagined virtues of efficiency and simplicity. It is free of value judgments, so the theory goes; it leaves everything to the hidden hand of the marketplace to allocate resources and to determine these issues of wealth. In reality, under Fightback's GST the hand is the hand of the Australian Taxation Office. And it is not hidden; it is omnipresent—to the tune of more than $20 billion.

         The significant component of the package is the provision for tax preferred infrastructure bonds. These will provide a new vehicle to channel private sector involvement in the provision of public infrastructure. As a capital raising tool, they are highly specific and suitable only for large, long term projects in the areas of land transport and public electricity generation. The bonds represent an acknowledgment that the tax deductibility of interest payments associated with traditional debt instruments is of limited value to the proponents of large infrastructure projects. The long lead times before income is generated, coupled with the reality that there is a likelihood of losses in the initial income producing years, ensure that that is the case.

The benefit to the borrower is in the form of cheaper capital, which is the difference between the project succeeding and failing.

Proponents, either Australian registered companies or unit trusts, must prove their bona fides by undertaking to retain ownership of the facility for the full 25 years of the income producing life of the project—that is, a minimum of 25 years. Furthermore, they have to convince the Taxation Office that the project is genuinely private, rather than being a government project financed off-budget by the private sector. As an extension of this, income streams will need to be based on public usage of the facility, rather than guaranteed public largesse—so no more ensured revenue cash streams.

The States know a window of opportunity when they see one and, as for major projects, they certainly see one in the One Nation tax measures.

         What is needed in the 1990s are practical measures in favour of development, value adding at every opportunity—value adding in those productive areas of the economy. It is in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the cognate Bills where we see such measures. In contrast, in Fightback all we can see is more expensive milk and more expensive bread. I commend the legislation to the House and urge its prompt passage for the benefit of the nation.

         —In the short time available to me I will concentrate my remarks on the Pooled Development Funds Bill. Pooled development funds are designed to provide a contrived, administrative mechanism to overcome perceived shortfall in venture capital funds. There is a debate, as outlined in the Industry Commission report on the structure and impediments to the venture capital and development capital industry, as to whether there is a shortage of available capital or a shortage of good, commercially packaged intellectual property.

         In the first case, the issue of the shortage of capital has to be addressed from a policy environment which drives domestic savings, permanently lowers on a sustainable and permanent basis interest and inflation rates—not recession driven—and encourages investment in productive assets. On the other hand, a research and development base which is closely aligned with the needs of local industry has to be developed in a serious, not cosmetic, way. Where there are commercially packaged technologies attuned to the market, we will find investment. It is no good running an R &amp; D effort which is detached from the market, which lives in a different world from that in which industry thrives.

         The PDFs are a disguised way of covering up failed government policies which killed the venture capital industry in this country. That is why last year some 80 per cent of Australia's best known venture capital companies failed to make a profit. The PDFs are administratively flawed. They have the smell of another financial adventure, rather than representing a genuine effort to reap the benefits of genuine research and development activities.

The intention of this exercise is to provide a fully funded mechanism for transferring taxation away from production, taking it off companies, and transferring it to consumption. Given undertakings in respect of abolishing $20 billion in company taxes, reforming the micro economy—including the labour market—and imposing uncompromising disciplines on expenditure and debt management, there can be no better way to create a cost environment in which business can thrive.

         For those many businesses and computer professionals affected, the recession has brought home the basic truth that the demand for the range of information of technology and services, as well as the body of relevant human skills, resides in the performance of the national economy. So, too, is the industry's capacity to invest affected by inflationary and interest rate expectations. In this regard economic stability characterised by sustainable growth which does not risk blow-outs in the key macroeconomic indicators is vital in the information industry, regardless of a company's position or function. Moreover, the need to consume and sponsor the further development of information technologies must be driven by companies seeking to invest in greater efficiencies for purposes of securing competitive advantages.

         Without doubt, the taxation reform package will create an array of new competitive forces. The abolition of customs duties and the move to negligible levels of protection by the year 2000, for example, are designed to lower costs further across the economy as well as to inject greater competitiveness into import competing industries. Such added competition will require adjustment. But it will also be introduced at the same time as the local information industry is exposed to new opportunities, by contracting out government computer maintenance and servicing and software drafting, in line with vastly reduced costs and overheads. It is important that the information industry sector understands the coalition's taxation reform package in respect of its total impact across the economy as well as in regard to the array of direct and indirect factors affecting firms' performances.

For every opportunity it offers to those businesses, it also offers a challenge to improve their competitive position still further.

It has been said before that, under a GST, small businesses will need a lot of time to collect the tax. It will create industry in one area: the technology industry.

For some time Australia has needed funds such as the pooled development funds so that industry, particularly small industry up to $30m, will be able to have assistance from the funds. From my experience in the finance industry, I can see that these funds will become a very important part of investment for a whole range of investors in the Australian community—provided, of course, they are given the right support by the Government, and also by members of the Opposition, who just seem to want to oppose such innovative measures as these funds. There are tax incentives in the funds, particularly in the superannuation area. As we all know, superannuation will expand. No matter what the Opposition's attitude is, people are going to invest more and more in superannuation in this country.

         —We have a number of tax Bills being rushed through the Parliament tonight, and on behalf of the Opposition I will focus specifically on the so-called tax simplification Bills, which are a series of Bills relating to the existing sales tax laws. The coalition will be opposing these measures. Can I start with a quote which I think is very relevant to the sales tax Bills before the House? The speaker was speaking back in June 1985, and said this:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . At present, the tax system contains three major indirect taxes—customs duty, the excises and the sales tax levied on manufactured goods at the wholesale level. This structure of indirect taxes is highly discriminatory.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there is no logical justification for a tax which discriminates against manufactured goods compared with services, particularly in a society which has seen services replace goods as the dominant field of economic activity.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Moreover, the existing wholesale sales tax is fraught with anomalies and complexities, which render administration and compliance unduly burdensome.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Among its other features which make it an undesirable tax are
       </para>

        .Its multiple rates and exemptions, which distort both demand and supply decisions

        .Valuation difficulties in determining a wholesale price in a world of widely varying distribution arrangements

        For all of these reasons, we are inclined to scrap the entire sales tax.

        Those words were spoken back in 1985 by none other than the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was campaigning for the abolition of sales tax. He was then a passionate advocate of the abolition of a tax system that he himself has said was discriminatory. And so it is.

         Australia's wholesale sales tax is one of the most unfair, distortionary, inefficient, regressive tax systems ever devised. It is an ancient tax system, and it really is incredible that this country still has a tax system which penalises so much effort and robs so many Australians of the incentive to produce. It is a tax system which virtually every expert in the country knows ought to have been abolished years ago. This is a tax that, believe it or not, we copied from the Canadians in 1930. It was introduced into Australia  by the last government in a depression as a temporary tax on luxuries. It has grown to be an absolute monster that we ought to put the knife to without further delay.

         When this country has a massive  debt, through the existing wholesale sales tax system we tax people who export. The very people we ought to encourage, we impose a tax upon. For people listening to this who find it a bit esoteric: in very simple terms it means that this country has a big debt; because we have a big debt, we have higher interest rates; every home mortgage in the country attracts higher interest rates in part as a result of the inefficiencies of our system and, in particular, of the wholesale sales tax. Not only do we penalise people who export, but as well, through the existing wholesale sales tax system, we give a tax advantage to those who import goods, compared with those who produce Australian made goods.

         Government members bleat about jobs, yet they have a tax system that penalises Australian producers, who offer the only prospect of jobs for nearly a million people unemployed. Here they are today bringing into the Australian Parliament a so-called reform of this tax system when there is only one thing to do with this tax system, and that is to abolish it lock, stock and barrel. They are making us a laughing-stock. Fancy taking a discredited tax system and proposing its reform and entrenchment in Australian law, when the only thing that ought to happen to it is that it be got rid of.

         I must say that, when one reads this myriad of Bills which bring these reforms to us, one finds a subtle message from the draftsmen, because they have tried to pick up the terminology of a value added tax system. Of course, it is totally inappropriate; there is no benefit from some of the terminology. But the terminology ought to send a very clear signal to the Government, and it ought to be introducing a value added tax system, not a single stage wholesale sales tax as is now proposed.

         This so-called simplification does not give Australia a simpler tax system. It is incredibly complicated, so much so that one of the experts who was apparently associated at some stage with providing advice to the Tax Office on this legislation, and was provided with the documents last week, reported back that it took him three days just to read them, let alone come to grips with the basic framework of the proposition. I see there is some chat amongst the experts as to whom that might have been. But if the experts cannot sit down and work out over two or three days what it means, what hope is there of the rest of the country understanding it?

There are going to be 1,500 pages or more in these tax laws. There is not a member of the Parliament who has read them. How can we be expected to properly analyse them when no opportunity is being provided to do so? So it is a backward looking step when Australia ought to be looking forward to producing a modern, competitive, internationally appropriate tax system.

         These guys opposite are back to the 1930s with a tax system which is totally discredited. Yet it is being rammed through the Parliament with no opportunity really to properly assess it. Admittedly in a large piece of tax law one would expect some last-minute amendments, but even today we get another seven amendments on top of what is already there, which sends a clear signal that it is unbelievably complicated. It is a retrograde measure, and obviously a wholesale sales tax ought to be strenuously opposed.

         Just to give the House a sense of some of the comments that are out and about in the community already, I will read one from the Tax Institute of Australia, which obviously is an independent, reputable body and one that has taken a long interest in tax reform. This is its damning comment on this new legislation:

        The President of the Tax Institute of Australia, Mr. Ian Langford-Brown, has called on the Federal Government to scrap the current wholesale sales tax system in favour of a broadly based goods and services tax.

       <para>
        He did not muck around; he went straight to the point. He said that the Government ought to scrap the hopeless system that we have now. The second paragraph states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Speaking in Queensland at the TIA's 10th national convention, Mr Langford-Brown said the Government's move to simplify wholesale sales tax legislation highlighted the fact that the current system was clumsy, confusing and outmoded.
       </para>
       <para>
        And so it is. This whole exercise just proves the point beyond a shadow of doubt. This system cannot be reformed. It is totally beyond repair and reform. There is only one thing to do with it, and that is to put it out of its misery. The comment goes on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        "The TIA welcomes the Government's move to write the present Sales Tax Acts in plain English," he said."However, the changes cover more than 600 pages of legislation and the explanatory memoranda merely confirms our view that a sales tax applying to selective goods at multiple rates is an entirely inappropriate response to the need for a simple and competitive indirect tax system.
       </para>
       <para>
        That says it all. It is so obvious. It is crazy going ahead with this reform package, and, of course, obviously and particularly so when the coalition is about to be elected and to do the job properly.

Of course that is no surprise. This is Labor's hidden consumption tax. It has for years and years been pulling in additional revenue. Those opposite have the hypocrisy to say, `We are opposed to consumption taxes'. Not only did the Prime Minister passionately advocate one just a few years ago; ever since he was Treasurer back in 1983 he has been busily increasing the revenue from this hidden consumption tax, so much so that—

It is a hidden tax, and the Government just keeps jacking it up and up. One can hardly move in this country without paying Labor's hidden consumption tax.

         I say to those listening to this on the radio that they pay tax on the radio. It is part of the hidden consumption tax. If they have a car and they drove to work today and stopped to fill up the car at the petrol station, there was another hidden consumption tax. Our Prime Minister is the great bandit bowser of Australian politics with his hidden consumption taxes. This latest tax reform simply means more tax.

         The Government now has a tax on the takeaway food industry, with an extra $4m there. The pet food industry, the breeders and the catteries will all pay an extra $3m. The plastic and rubber sheeting industry, the miners and the farmers will all pay more taxes. Retailers that have goods produced by a contract manufacturer will have to pay more. Contractors to government bodies in certain circumstances will pay more. Consumers will pay more for pizzas and biscuits and thick shakes—an extra $2m or $3m just from that item alone.

         Not only does this legislation have that direct impact on individuals in terms of consumption items; there are no income tax cuts to go with it either. This is just straight out of our pockets—a straight extra cost on us. But there will be a whole lot of other consequences in the management of this new system, in particular in respect of generic products. In a recession a lot of people have been buying a lot more of the generic products, that is, the own brands of Coles, Woolworths, Safeway, Bi-Lo, Franklins and those sorts of chains. They have found their generic products booming, particularly with low income earners. They are cheaper than others and people have obviously been under a lot of pressure because of the recession.

         The common claim of the Labor Party is, `Well, food is not currently subject to tax'. That, of course, is a lie—one of the Government's favourite lies. In a sense, that lie is to be perpetrated again as a result of another measure introduced in this tax reform package involving advertising for retailers. Currently, if retailers are putting together a catalogue, it is only the printing that is subject to tax. Under this measure the whole exercise—the models one might use, the photography, the layout, the design, the typesetting, the film, the use of an advertising agency—will now be subject to tax. What that will mean is that a lot of retailers will spend a lot more money on their advertising. I know of one example where it will cost an extra $1m a year. I am told that for the industry it will be literally millions and millions of dollars. That will just be passed on in the cost of toothpaste, bread and everything else we buy every day of the week.

         The third impact which is worth mentioning is in respect of small business. Under the goods and services tax, business will pay the tax on the things that it buys, collect the tax on the things that it sells and send the difference to the government. In other words, business will collect the tax. But GST is a consumption tax; it is not a tax on business. So under our reform package we will abolish a whole lot of taxes on business and we will not replace them.

         The Government's response to all of this is to provide a bigger exemption for small business under its rotten, crummy system. It is up to $10,000 liability for sales tax. If one's liability is less than that, one does not pay sales tax. But, if in any particular year one sells goods to a big retailer such as Myer and goes over the $10,000 limit, I am reliably advised that those goods are called untaxed goods. What that means is that Myer would have to pick up the tab on that tax. If one talks to Coles Myer and a few of the other big stores, they say, `Hang on. This is a poisoned chalice. If we buy goods and then find that we have to pick up the tab on the sales tax, that comes out of our pocket; so we are going to be very wary about dealing with small businesses who reckon they have an exemption, because we do not know whether they have or have not. If they have not and it is over $10,000, the big companies will have to wear it'.

There is no doubt about it; it is a kindergarten effort. Who ever heard of any government in the world seeking to put in place a consumption tax proposal which does not actually compensate the people that are most hurt, the poor?  Has anyone heard of such a proposal?  In the whole international system, wherever a consumption tax has been put in place, has a major party ever put forward a proposal and said, `Well, we know that this proposal is going to impose a 15 per cent tax on food, on clothing, on the basic necessities of life, on services, on everything that deals with life in the economy.'?  The next thing we know, if we look for compensation for the people that are most affected, we find that it is not there.

The reality is that even conservative parties now are deciding, `This is a bit extreme; there is something wrong here'. But the Leader of the Opposition cannot see this. He thinks that there is nothing wrong. The rest of the world has decided to move towards a more moderate position and understands the fundamental facts that a mixed economy means a mixed economy and we have to have a private and a public sector—those sorts of basic points—but what do we have here? We have an attempt to totally destroy the public sector; an attempt to make huge cuts in employment, especially in the public sector; and, in addition, all of these other suggestions that come out of the GST package.

I must say it beats knowing anything about the Sales Tax Assessment Bill, the Sales Tax Imposition (Excise) Bill and the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Bill. A speaker to an earlier Bill, as part of the scare campaign, said, `We will have to have computers in every business house in Australia because of the coalition's goods and services tax and the Fightback package'. Under Fightback and the proposals in relation to the goods and services tax in particular, businesses will be involved only in keeping the records that they already keep in order to ascertain their income tax requirements. That is another dimension of the scare campaign. Those opposite will go back to scaring old ladies. That is about the form of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who has just spoken.

         We are talking about criticism from a government whose Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once said that, in effect, the coalition Government made sure that there was a tax collector at every petrol bowser in the country. The present—or temporary—Prime Minister said that not all that long ago. Of course, under Fightback there will be a tax discounter at every petrol bowser in the country. In effect, each private person who buys a litre of petrol will pay 19c a litre less. If this petrol happens to be part of a business input, that will be reduced to 26c.

         This legislation represents the Government's latest attempt to expand the wholesale sales tax system under the guise of the final outcome of the sales tax simplification review that was announced in the 1990-91 Budget. This review was supposedly the most comprehensive examination of our antiquated and ramshackle wholesale sales tax system yet conducted. This is the result of it. Despite the allegedly comprehensive nature of the review, the proposed changes contained in these Bills constitute further stealthy tinkering with the existing system, and nothing more.

As I have said before, all of these changes add up to mere tinkering with the sales tax system which, in some cases, will exacerbate existing problems with the system, as well as add some new ones. Superficially, the opt-out provisions for businesses with sales tax liabilities of under $10,000 look attractive and will ease the compliance burden of the sales tax laws on those firms that qualify for the exemption. But it disguises the fact that there is virtually no tax relief contained in these so-called reform measures for small or large businesses. In fact, according to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), sales tax collections will actually increase under this legislation. We do not always believe him, but I cannot imagine he would be misleading us about that. In fact, according to the Treasurer, sales tax collections will actually increase under this legislation.

         Businesses will still be faced with sales tax on their business purchases, especially those businesses that opt out of the sales tax system under the small business concession and thereby forfeit the sales tax exemption currently available on some, although by no means all, of their business inputs.

        In other words, while they will no longer have to levy sales tax on their outputs, they will still have to pay sales tax on their business inputs—some deal, some concession! However, eligible businesses which do not opt out of the wholesale sales tax system will not be significantly better off in this regard. While they will continue to have some limited input tax relief available to them through the existing system of sales tax exemptions, they will nonetheless continue to be heavily taxed on their business inputs. This is because in many cases wholesale sales tax is not paid directly, but indirectly, through the higher prices charged by suppliers who themselves must pay sales tax.

         The available system of exemptions has done little to reduce the amount of sales tax cascading through the production processes of innumerable firms throughout our country. There is also a whole range of other indirect taxes, such as fuel excise and payroll tax, which business must pay either directly or indirectly through the higher costs passed on by their suppliers. These taxes are built into the price of a whole range of goods and services that are purchased in the course of conducting business activities. There is thus little or no tax relief to be made available to business under these so-called reforms to the sales tax system.

         Mr Russell Maynard, Director of Indirect Tax Services with Arthur Andersen, has advised small business to be cautious in choosing to take advantage of sales tax exemptions, since they may not be significantly better off as a result of not being required to levy sales tax on their outputs. Another senior partner of Arthur Andersen, Mr Paul Warton, is a little more blunt and has claimed that most businesses would end up paying more tax if they chose to opt out of the wholesale sales tax system because of the reduced relief from sales tax on business inputs that would then be available. That is a good indication of how paltry the benefits from these changes will be for many small businesses.

         The revenue cost of these measures is said to be as little as $20m to $30m. The alleged benefits of these changes to the sales tax system pale into insignificance compared with the tax relief contained in the coalition's Fightback package for Australian businesses. Our commitment to abolish the wholesale sales tax system, lock, stock and barrel, will alone save business some $5 billion annually. Total sales tax collections of some $9.4 billion in 1991 will be abolished in the future. In total, the coalition will lift some $20 billion in taxes off the backs of business, which makes even the $5 billion to be saved from the abolition of sales tax on business inputs look small. There is just no comparison between the comprehensive tax relief to be made available to business under the Fightback package and the tinkering with the sales tax system contained in this legislation.

         A worrying aspect of these new sales tax laws is the introduction of new anti-avoidance provisions, though. These apparently take the form of a general anti-avoidance provision, similar to that found in part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In the case of income tax law, part IVA has come in for heavy criticism for opening up scope for the Tax Office to abuse its many powers over taxpayers. It allows the Tax Commissioner to take action against taxpayers where there is no violation of the letter of the law, only a breach of its generally stated intention.

Clearly, the Government intends to make use of these provisions to obtain more revenue, although it says otherwise.

         It should not be forgotten that these anti-avoidance provisions would be largely unnecessary under the coalition's goods and services tax. The system of rebates for GST to be payable on business purchases under our program provides businesses with a positive incentive to comply with the terms of the GST law and fully collect and remit the GST. There is an incentive there: if they do not do it, they bear it. In addition, invoicing for GST makes it very difficult for a supplier to avoid remitting any of the GST collected from other businesses.

         The new measures fail to address the vast array of anomalies that have emerged under the wholesale sales tax system, both in the sales tax treatment of certain goods and in the range of exemptions made available to some users of these goods, but not others. There is no recognition of the cascading effects of the wholesale sales tax—and other indirect taxes, for that matter—through the production process. The wholesale sales tax will continue to fall heavily on intermediate business inputs, investment goods and exports, in addition to the burden placed on consumers.

I remind the honourable member for Curtin that, whilst we were representing the Parliament in New York last year, he may have had his eyes opened about the effect of indirect taxes. He will remember, as I do, that in New York, where the indirect tax that he was talking about was only 8 per cent, every time we walked into a shop we did not know how much we were paying and we had to add on the extra tax—the sort of tax which mirrors the tax proposals the Opposition wants to bring in here.

         A few things that the honourable member for Curtin said deserve some comment. Sadly, I think he works on the principle that the effluxion of time will erase from the memories of most Australians the air of tax avoidance that we had under the Liberal Party. I remind him that it was this Government that wiped out tax avoidance. Not under us did we see the bottom of the harbour schemes. Not under us did we have a royal commissioner saying that the only growth industry in Australia was the avoidance of tax and that for people on substantial incomes the paying of tax was an option.

         Now the Liberal Party is saying it is going to wipe out tax avoidance. Let us look at the difference between the wholesale sales tax and the proposed goods and services tax to which the honourable member referred in his speech. We cannot do better than look at the black or cash economy. One of the things that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), who looks like he has been hit behind the head with a mullet, is saying is that it is going to wipe out the black economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I refer to a book written by Austin Donnelly, who was promoted by the publishers of the book as Australia's No. 1 business writer.

         In this excellent book by Mr Austin Donnelly there is one point that actually illustrates the difference between the present wholesale sales tax and the goods and services tax which is being promoted by the Opposition. I refer to a minority of Australians, thank goodness, but Australians nevertheless, who have serious health problems. Mr Donnelly is one of those. At page 22 of his book he says:

        That is a fair enough question. At present he does not. I see the newly promoted Opposition frontbencher, the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), eagerly on the phone waiting to call a quorum because what I am saying is upsetting her a little. Mr Donnelly says:

        If the GST were to be introduced, when I bought a loaf of bread I would pay about three times as much tax as other people.

So I cannot eat ordinary bread, but only gluten free which costs about three times as much as normal bread. . .

        The effect of the GST and the Opposition's policy is to target that small minority of Australians who already pay more than other Australians because of their health ailments. But that problem will be compounded because the GST is raised on the retail sales of such goods.

I saw the way its members caved in when we talked about putting a means test on family allowances for people earning about $60,000 a year. What hope do they have when they start getting people such as Mr Donnelly who have health ailments and who, under the present wholesale sales tax regime pay no tax on their special diets, to pay—as he says in his book—three times as much for such things? One has to start wondering about the fairness of it all and about those Australians who are disadvantaged by their health. The Opposition would compound the problem by bringing in such a tax.

         My good friend the honourable member for Curtin, who spoke previously, spoke about the tax on cars. He derided the fact that the Government had brought down the level of wholesale sales tax from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. What he did not say was that our tax is applied at the wholesale level. For those people who take more than a passing interest in the cost of cars—I will get down to the sorts of cars that people drive soon—I can tell them that the Liberals want to apply the GST to the retail cost of cars.

         The difference between the wholesale sales tax when it is levied on an item such as a car and the retail tax when the car is taken out of the yard is quite substantial. The effect is that the price of Ferraris will go down by about $30,000 and the price of Falcons will go up by about $500 to $700. So for the average Joe Blow in the street who drives a Falcon, a good Australian-made car, the car will cost him more. However, for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and people who associate with him, who like driving Ferrari cars and have actually made a song and dance about it, the cost of cars will come down. One has to look at the fairness of that.

Under a flat rate goods and services tax, we have absolutely no hope.

         Most of the countries in the OECD have a goods and services tax only because it is a condition of their being in the EC. They could not get into the European Community unless they had a goods and services tax; it is a prerequisite to membership of the Common Market. Most countries, given the choice, would not have one. Why would Australia? We are not trying to join the European Common Market. Why would we have a goods and services tax? We do not need one. We are the second lowest taxing country in the world. We do not tax the necessities of life. This pamphlet and the re-launch say that the goods and services tax is dead. That is why the wholesale sales tax system will apply in many countries for many years to come.

         —I have not heard such a lot of rubbish for a long time. With this Sales Tax Assessment Bill 1992 and the five cognate sales tax Bills the Government had the opportunity to institute some real reform, to overhaul an outdated and archaic form of taxation and to replace it with a much simpler and fairer tax—a goods and services tax. Instead, we have been presented with a package of six Bills which will do little, if anything, to help small business, industry and our ailing economy.

         This legislation does represent a simplification of the existing 27 Acts; however, the documentation still remains many hundreds of pages long and it is extremely complex, even though it is meant to be in plain English. The legislation is so complicated that it has taken tax experts days to decipher what the legislation actually entails.

         In this legislation the Government is significantly widening the scope of the wholesale sales tax. It claims that the new legislation will result in extra sales tax revenue of $61m in 1992-93 and $91m in 1993-94. As in so many situations in the past, it appears that the Government's definition of `reform' simply means higher taxation. In fact, since this Government came to power sales tax receipts have almost trebled, from $3.4 billion to $9.7 billion.

         With this legislation the Government is attempting to bring within its scope the cost of services provided to the manufacturers of goods if they then sell those goods by retail. These services may include such things as research and development, marketing costs and design work which is subcontracted out by the manufacturer. In the past, manufacturers have been able to exclude a range of costs from their manufacturing base by structuring their arrangements. For example, supermarket chains which produce home brand goods and have the goods manufactured essentially by outside countries have previously not had to pay sales tax on the external contracts. The Government has now determined that these goods will attract sales tax.

         Furthermore, the legislation will see sales tax rates increase for certain products. For instance, tax exemptions for certain business inputs used in the manufacture in retail premises of biscuits, pizzas and thick shakes will be removed, and the tax on containers for takeaway food will be taxable at 20 per cent rather than 10 per cent. As a result, prices for consumers will increase yet again, but with no compensation.

         Earlier reports about this legislation said that the so-called reforms contained in it were designed to make it easier for businesses to decide their tax liability and to handle the paperwork involved. However, this will not be the case because, as a consequence of this legislation, a completely new body of law introducing entirely different items and section numbers will be put in place. This will render invalid all current sales tax case law, including Australian Taxation Office rulings on sales tax, and place businesses in the unenviable position of having to grapple with over 1,200 pages of new sales tax law.

         The business community will need to rely on the advice of sales tax experts more than ever before. Under this legislation businesses which pay less than $10,000 a year in sales tax will be able to opt out of the system. If this option is taken out, goods sold by these businesses will be exempt from sales tax and sales tax returns will no longer be required to be lodged. However, the catch is that if they opt out of the system, they would then be required to pay tax on their business inputs, their raw materials, their aids to manufacture, their stock for resale by wholesalers and their containers. In fact, this legislation could easily result in small businesses having to pay more tax if they are businesses with big equipment purchases.

          That is a major concern, so much so that the sales tax partner in Ernst and Young, Jennifer Labourne, has urged small businesses to be extremely cautious with this proposal.

         The problems for small business are compounded because medium and large businesses will still be subject to sales tax and, as a result, the cost of the tax will be built into the price of all goods which they sell to small business. Quite simply, the Government is giving with one hand and taking with the other. It is little wonder that Graham Byrne, President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said that many in small business are attracted to the `sell up, invest in government bonds and retire to the sun' option.

         However, as he correctly points out, this option does little, if anything, to create the products, the exports and the jobs needed to generate a sustained economic recovery. The only way to truly help our small businesses and industries is to completely abolish the wholesale sales tax. Business needs the burden of taxation removed so that it can begin to grow and so provide secure and lasting employment for the almost one million Australians who are out of work.

         In short, this simplification falls far short of the benefits to business and industry that will flow from the coalition's Fightback plan to introduce a goods and services tax and to remove not only sales tax, but a total of seven taxes from business and industry. As Treasury analysis has shown, enormous savings would accrue to business through the implementation of the Fightback plan. For instance, the plan would remove $2 billion of tax on exports.

         However, the issue of sales tax on exports has not been addressed by the Government in this legislation, despite the fact that the Industry Commission's final report on export enhancement measures found that Australia's business tax regime should be reformed to reduce tax on exporters. The report said:

        Simplification of tax law should be about making it less costly for business to obtain tax advice and about enabling more expeditious clarification of uncertain areas in the law which currently hold up decisions and cause expensive litigation. This legislation fails to do just that, and fails to remove the burden of taxation from business inputs. Instead, it does just the opposite. As a result, the coalition is forced to oppose this legislation. As this legislation shows, sales tax is an archaic tax in a modern era. It is beyond reform and should be abolished.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, it is said that the two certainties in life are death and taxation. Certainly this rings true when we consider the history of small business and sales tax under the present Government. Under Labor, 87,000 small businesses have been killed off, and sales tax revenue has increased by well over 200 per cent. Nearly every year under Labor the sales tax net has been widened and sales tax rates have been increased. This year, sales tax accounts for more than $9.2 billion or 10.1 per cent of total Commonwealth taxes.

         Sales tax adds directly to the cost of an extensive range of retail goods and business inputs. For example, when a pensioner buys pet food for his trusty companion, or when his child buys flavoured milk at his school canteen, sales tax directly increases the price. Even those items which are not directly subject to sales tax are often affected indirectly. Sales tax means that a truckie, for example, might be expected to pay around $40,000 extra on the price of a rig that he needs to buy for his business. He will pay more sales tax every time he replaces his tyres, buys a tarpaulin or carries out any repairs to or maintenance of his vehicle that requires parts.

         In fact, by the Government's own Treasury Department estimates, sales tax adds $400m to $500m to road transport costs. These costs are passed on to the price of every product which is freighted on Australian roads. In other words, goods that do not have sales tax imposed on them directly still have the cost of sales tax built into their end price. In fact, all categories of goods and services bear some wholesale sales tax, either directly or indirectly. Indeed, sales tax is the equivalent of a hidden consumption tax of 5.4 per cent of the final price of consumption.

         For example, although food is generally thought to be free of sales tax, 3.3 per cent of the end price of food is made up directly or indirectly of sales tax in this country under this Government. Without doubt, sales tax is the worst of all of this Government's hidden taxes. The public usually has little idea of whether the product includes sales tax, let alone the rate at which it applies. Furthermore, sales tax rates in a range of taxable areas have been increased, virtually at the whim of this Government, and are likely to be increased in the future. It is of particular concern to the coalition that the impact of sales tax falls most heavily on small business around this nation. Firstly, sales tax imposes considerable costs on small businesses, which in turn puts a significant cost on them.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, sales tax imposes considerable costs on small business, which in turn significantly reduces its competitiveness. We just have to look around the average office to see the impact of sales tax on items such as the telephone, fax machine, office furniture and fixtures, computer and stationery—all of which are taxed at 20 per cent. Alternatively, we can consider a supermarket which pays 20 per cent sales tax on a range of business inputs from checkout bags and cash register rolls through to shopping trolleys and shelving stock. We have pity on all those retailers who buy stock, inclusive of sales tax, and have it displayed in their showrooms for weeks or even months before they have sold it. All that time they have their cash flow constrained because of the money tied up in tax on stock which is sitting idly on their showroom floors.

         Treasury has calculated that sales tax adds more than $2.3 billion to the costs incurred by Australian manufacturers; $228m to farmers' costs; $411m to the costs of our mining sector; $1.2 billion to construction costs; and a staggering $5.7 billion to the costs of Australia's service industries. At the very time that Australian businesses need to become as competitive as possible, sales tax is dragging them down.

         The second major problem for small business stems from the complexity of the sales tax system. It is a nightmare for many businesses to determine whether sales tax applies and, if so, at what rate. Then there is the growing list of sales tax anomalies, including, for example, the way that sales tax is imposed on stock used by wine producers to promote their product. Wine producers, who often participate in free tastings and offer free samples for tasting at their cellars, must pay sales tax on the wine used for these purposes, despite the fact that it is never actually sold.

         Another anomaly I have attempted to persuade the Government to deal with concerns four-wheel drive vehicles. A farmer can buy such a vehicle free of sales tax whereas a professional fisherman must pay around $5,000 on a typical four-wheel drive vehicle. Clearly, the sales tax system has no rhyme or reason.

         So what does the legislation before the House do to resolve these problems, and what does it do to reduce the costs associated with sales tax? Undoubtedly, the most important change proposed by this legislation, from the small business point of view, concerns the option for businesses with an annual wholesale tax liability of less than $10,000 to opt out of the sales tax system. On the face of it, this looks quite attractive. But, as with so many of the Government's fiscal measures, the taxpayer gains very little but pays a heavy cost.

         Consider, firstly, the size of each business which will be able to opt out of the sales tax system under this proposal. If a business deals in goods with a 20 per cent rate of tax, for example, its annual turnover must be less than $50,000 for it to be eligible to opt out of the sales tax system. This illustrates how the Government's measure is limited to only businesses with relatively low turnovers. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has confirmed that less than 7 per cent of small businesses will be affected by this measure. In reality, the actual figure will be much lower than this. This is because any business which has a sales tax liability of under $10,000 and which chooses to opt out of the system must pay sales tax on its business inputs. So, whereas a woodworker or other small business person can currently buy certain equipment, such as lathes and tools, exempt from sales tax, the Government will put an end to this concession if he or she chooses to opt out of the sales tax system. The Government is giving with one hand and taking with the other.

         The second question I raise is whether the Government's proposed measures will reduce business costs. The national director of Ernst and Young is reported as having said that the big winner from these changes would be the Government itself, which stands to collect an extra $91m a year.

         —Mr Firmstone of Ernst and Young acknowledged that some businesses would be able to opt out of the sales tax system, but concluded that more would lose than win. There is only one way to simplify the sales tax system properly, and that is to scrap it altogether. This would solve all the problems caused by the way sales tax adds to business costs. This is part of the coalition's approach to introducing a fairer, simpler tax system for all Australians. Scrapping sales tax totally, along with six other taxes, and introducing a broadly based goods and services tax will end the administrative nightmare confronting small business and, most importantly, will dramatically reduce business costs.

         A senior Ernst and Young indirect tax specialist said that the Government's measures would do nothing to eliminate business taxes. He went on to say:

        Business would certainly pay less tax under the GST proposals though they might not necessarily know it since WST is a hidden tax.

        These are accounting firms that deal with everyday tax problems faced by small business and they have all rejected the Government's tax changes in favour of the GST. It is no wonder that the latest business survey shows that 68 per cent of small businesses support the GST as being good for the economy, compared with just 13 per cent who disagree.

         It is no wonder that all the major small business groups around Australia support the coalition Fightback plan. The main reason for this support is that Fightback and GST significantly reduce costs, unlike the existing sales tax system which increases the operating costs of businesses and reduces their profitability and competitiveness.

         The changes proposed by the Government are not totally without benefit to small business, but when stacked up against the coalition's comprehensive package they pale into insignificance. Whereas sales tax is a burden on cash flow, the GST actually gives small business owners a significant cash flow advantage. This is because businesses will be able to keep the GST they collect for a period before they have to remit it to the Tax Office. This is money which they can use to earn interest or realistically help to reduce the business overdraft. The other major cash flow advantage, whereby tax will not be tied up in stock, should also be considered. This is because GST paid on most small business inputs will be fully rebatable and because the ultimate payment of tax will take place only when the goods in question are actually sold.

         Furthermore, GST is simplicity itself. Contrary to the Government's anti-GST scaremongering campaign, most businesses will simply carry on using their existing bookkeeping system without the need for additional invoicing procedures. But most importantly, GST is part of an overall plan to slash business costs by a staggering $20 billion and to improve their competitiveness and profitability. That is the way to simplify the tax system and reduce business costs.

        As can be seen, only New South Wales and Queensland, the drought affected States, recorded declines in the total area of winter cereal crops planted. More importantly, the largest increase was recorded in Victoria, followed by South Australia, and lastly, Western Australia.

        According to ABARE, the extent and structure of Australian winter cereal cropping in the 1991-92 season underwent marked changes.  There were two main influences.  Firstly, around the time that ground preparation for planting of the 1991-92 winter crop was being carried out, wheat prices, although rising, were at levels considerably below the prevailing prices of the same time in 1990-91.  In the 1991-92 season, farmers right across Australia became more interested in growing alternative winter crops to wheat for which prices had not fallen so markedly.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Consequently, in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria the combined total area of wheat planted fell from 5.94 million hectares in 1990-91 to 5.66 million hectares in 1991-92—a fall of 4.7 per cent.  At the same time, the combined total area of alternative crops planted in those States rose from 3.669 million hectares to 4.408 million hectares—a rise of 20.1 per cent. Therefore, despite the reduction in wheat plantings there was an overall increase in these States' combined total winter cereal crop plantings of 459,000 hectares, or 4.8 per cent.  The crops on which expansion focused included barley, oats, canola, field peas, chick peas and lupins.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The second major influence on cropping decisions in the 1991-92 season was the drought in Queensland and New South Wales.  In these States the combined total area of wheat plantings fell from 3.295 million hectares in 1990-91 to 2.255 million hectares in 1991-92—a fall of 31.6 per cent.  This fall was the result of the combined effects of drought and farmers switching to alternative winter crops.  Despite the drought, the combined total area of alternative winter crop plantings in these States rose from 1.385 million hectares to 1.599 million hectares—a rise of  15.5 per cent.

        One conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that farmers appear to have responded to market signals by switching between crops, presumably to maximise profits. The range of suitable alternative winter crops to wheat is sufficiently broad to ensure that dissatisfaction with wheat prices in any given season will not necessarily result in a net reduction in cropping activity.  It could also be argued that any government action that distorted the price signals reaching farmers would have an effect on their choice of crops as well as the total area planted.

        Whilst there has not been, nor is there intended to be, a formal study of the effects of the proposed Western Australian guaranteed minimum price for wheat, it is useful to draw a comparison between that State's cropping activity in 1991-92 and the cropping in South Australia and Victoria, the other non-drought affected States.  In Western Australia the total winter cereal crop area rose 2.5 per cent while in South Australia and Victoria the total areas of winter cereal plantings rose by 3.3 per cent and 13.8 per cent respectively.

        Looking at wheat separately, in Western Australia in 1991-92 the total area of winter plantings fell by 3.1 per cent, while the corresponding falls in South Australia and Victoria were 7.0 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively.

        If anything, Western Australia's proposed guaranteed minimum price for wheat seems to have had the effect of reducing the diversification away from wheat in that State.  The percentage increase in total winter cereal crop plantings in Western Australia was, however, less than in either South Australia or Victoria.  Therefore, it could also be argued that one of the costs of attempting to preserve the size of the wheat crop in Western Australia was reduced plantings of alternative crops.  These alternative crops are valuable to Australia.  From a national perspective, it is highly questionable as to whether there would be any benefit in encouraging farmers to grow more wheat and correspondingly less of another crop such as barley, particularly at times of low wheat prices.  Indeed, there is real benefit in sustaining alternative crop rotation strategies.

        The proposal to offer a guaranteed minimum price for wheat in Western Australia did not prevent a movement away from wheat to the planting of alternative winter cereal crops.  However, it may have reduced the extent of this movement in Western Australia, when compared to the other non-drought affected States.

        (a) One of the Australian Tourist Commission's (ATC) principal objectives, as stated in the Australian Tourist Commission Act (1987), is to maximise the benefits to Australia from overseas visitors.  Pre-eminence is given to this objective in ATC Corporate Planning.  The ATC commits more resources than ever before into its international marketing efforts.  Its total budget expenditure in 1991/92 will reach some $94.4 million, an increase of 16% over the previous year.  Of this amount 25% comes from industry sources in support of the ATC's cooperative marketing programs.

        (b) The ATC uses a wide variety of marketing techniques to promote Australia as a destination for overseas visitors and thus achieve its objectives.  Print and television advertising, as well as public relations activities, trade shows and publications are used to promote Australia.  The Commission's current marketing emphasis is on converting interest or intent to visit Australia into actual bookings, particularly amongst high-yield visitors.  This policy is being implemented in all our overseas markets by cooperative marketing campaigns with State and Territory Tourism Commissions and the tourism industry.

        The additional appropriation of $5 million for 1991/92 and $10 million for 1992/93 which the ATC received as a result of the Government's One Nation Statement is being spent in overseas markets to increase the number of international visitors to Australia.  Such an increase will result in maximising employment opportunities for Australians.

        On the basis of the best information available to us, the increase in interest in recent years by Japanese investors in the Australian beef industry has resulted from the progressive liberalisation of the Japanese market which had previously been restricted to very low levels of foreign-sourced beef in order to protect Japanese producers.  The liberalisation has given Japanese investors a new incentive to invest in the production and processing of beef in this country.

        Firstly, scientific research is necessary to establish the true status of the stocks and the reason for their depletion if that is the case.  This assessment must also aim to determine the extent of the overfishing that has occurred.  The scientific technology for making these assessments does exist. However, the extensive field and laboratory research required is often prohibitively expensive.  In other words, it may cost more than even the potential fishery is worth to determine the stock status very precisely. Scientists typically work within a limited budget and their assessments are invariably clouded by some measure of uncertainty.  Research work by CSIRO Division of Fisheries and the Bureau of Rural Resources is aimed at refining the assessments of Australian fisheries resources.

      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Often difficult management decisions based on these assessments must be made in spite of this uncertainty.  For example, Australia's valuable southern bluefin tuna industry is based on a stock that has been judged to be severely depleted but the catch restrictions in place now are thought to be sufficient to allow stock recovery.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Secondly, having determined the true status of the stocks, scientific advice on how to regenerate those stocks has usually been centred on achieving the regeneration through restricting fishing effort.  If catch restrictions are applied soon enough and maintained, most stocks will recover. Unfortunately, in some cases, the depletion is caused by more than simple overfishing.  Loss of nursery habitats of small fish in coastal areas may have a serious impact on the ability of some stocks to recover.

        An alternative solution is to use aquaculture technology to breed replacement stock in artificial holding ponds, tanks or enclosures.  Again, this technology exists but is often either technically difficult or expensive to implement.  In Tasmania, a substantial program of scallop farming is now showing promise.  In this case, the young scallops are collected from the wild and reared in an environment that protects them from  death by natural causes. This technology has been used successfully by a number of other countries, including France, China and Japan.  Again, this process is designed not so much to regenerate natural stocks but to derive maximum profit from the spawned young of existing small populations.

        There are a some examples of successful regeneration of wild stocks. For example, the chum salmon in Japan has become a large profitable fishery by raising and then releasing young fish.  Aspects of the salmon's biology make this fish suitable for this type of aquaculture.  Other species may be much more difficult.  There is a wide range of ecological effects that could intervene in an otherwise well-founded attempt to enhance wild stocks by re-seeding.  Ecosystems are not linear and it has been shown that attempts by people to return a disturbed ecosystem to its original state is not a trivial operation.

        In Sydney the NSW Fisheries Research Institute has successfully reared snapper in holding tanks.  Stripy trumpeter have been reared by Tasmanian researchers.  Although these species have already been raised successfully, it is a major step to raise enough individuals to effect an increase in the size of natural populations.  Some species such as redfish and southern bluefin tuna may live for over 20 years, and orange roughy may live more than 100 years. Recovery of these stocks by enhancement (using aquaculture) would be an extremely expensive operation that may require decades of work, even though the technology probably already exists.  The use of technology to boost natural populations is a reality now for some species such as scallops, but the cost-benefit of undertaking such a program for other depleted species (particularly longer lived fish) has not yet been demonstrated.
