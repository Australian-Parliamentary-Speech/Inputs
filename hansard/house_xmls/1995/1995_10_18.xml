        It is an appalling indictment of government in this country—and, I must say, the media, which were almost universally in favour of the third runway before it opened. But all this public manipulation and displacement of people around the airport has been going on for 40 years. It is just that it has been slower and less dramatic than the present crisis brought on by the third runway. In future this bill will ensure that the same thing will happen at Kurnell, Marrickville and many other places to a lesser or greater degree.

         So there we have it—low income housing relentlessly destroyed after 40 years and this is set to continue into the future, all consciously decided by a Labor government led by a minister who is primarily concerned with and indeed outraged by a possible threat to the continuation of this process and, in his own words, `inconveniencing foreign investors'.

         Since 1945 the airport has been one of the major causes of the loss of over a quarter of a million inner Sydney residents—a huge economic and social cost recognised and established in countless state and federal reports for well over 20 years but never sheeted home to the airport. Never at any stage have state or federal governments quantified this massive cost, preferring to allow it to be a secret subsidy to the airlines. The fact is that, if it had ever been quantified and charged, the airport could not have remained at Kingsford Smith.

         Nothing demonstrates the stranglehold that private interests have on governments in Australia better than this, and the fact that the third runway could proceed on top of all the massive expenditure of public money in past expansions without any cost-benefit studies. Instead, this bill not only continues the process but also effectively shuts forever the long-term objective of redeveloping the airport site and the surrounding areas, even in the event of a horrific air crash killing hundreds of people, except by massive compensation to private companies.

         What the bill envisages is a continuation of the expansion of urban blight—a continuation of a subsidy to the airlines by taxpayer expenditure for airport related infrastructure many kilometres from the airport funded by ratepayers, state taxpayers and Australian taxpayers. The bill not only entrenches the enormous subsidy of a huge area of free land in the heart of Sydney but also ignores the opportunity of redeveloping the 30 square kilometres or so around the airport which is occupied by airport related infrastructure, storage areas and wasteland.

         The bill also ignores the massive loss of property values that Sydney residents have borne in the past, bear in the present and will bear in the future. Everything up to 14 kilometres, and more in some cases, is affected and in all directions, irrespective of the relief given by the effective closure of the east-west runway. The threat is always there, and not only existing residents are affected. It will affect all types of urban development into the long-term future.

         By an irony, one of the loudest voices in Sydney in the 1980s on the need to construct the third runway was the head of a Sydney tourism task force, Mr Syd Londish. Mr Londish was extremely vocal until it became obvious that a multi-million dollar development with which he was associated at Pulpit Point, Hunters Hill, lay directly on the centre line of the third runway. The development never achieved anticipated sales because of the then threat of the runway and was, I have no doubt, a factor in the large scale collapse of Mr Londish's enterprises. In the face of all this, how can the government continue to parade this bill as a great micro-economic reform when it is in fact an economic disaster?

         The Federal Airports Corporation, since it was commissioned in 1986, has proved the dangers of corporatisation and senior executives of supposedly publicly owned organisations losing any sense of public purpose. It, like many other public corporations such as the CAA, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Qantas, soon became a self-serving organisation shamelessly lying to the public and using public funds for its own and private purposes.

         Nevertheless, there is some evidence that within its narrow scale of values it was an efficient operator of airports. A Travers Morgan study of over 40 major international airports showed that Sydney airport landing and associated charges were the fourth lowest of the airports studied. Additionally, a study by a United Kingdom expert showed that, compared with United Kingdom and European airports, the FAC's productivity is significantly higher while unit operating costs are proportionally lower.

         While most of this is based on commissioned studies and self-assertions by the FAC itself, and therefore of doubtful veracity, there is enough evidence to suggest that there is no substantial gain to be made from privatisation which could even fractionally justify the economic and environmental disaster that the bill proposes for the future. While there is no question that many aspects of airport operations can be contracted out to a great extent, that is no excuse for the wholesale privatisation and almost total loss of public control envisaged in this bill.

         It is significant that the minister has dwelt on the extensive but private consultations he has had with potential investors for the airport. He is vitally concerned that they might be `inconvenienced'. But where is there any consultation with the residents of Sydney? What about their `inconvenience'? Where is there any consultation with local government bodies affected by the airport, or the many resident organisations or the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council? The latter organisation has stated:

        If the serious issues we have referred to above are not resolved, Australian airports could be privatised without any real safeguards for local communities. If this happens, profit would be paramount and the interests of residents would come a poor and distant second—a very accurate understatement. Frankly, it is actions like this that have given the minister the worst public reputation of any politician in living memory in Sydney.

         The opposition amendments—given the opposition's consistent support over many years for the expansion of the Sydney airport, the third runway and privatisation—can only be regarded as unprincipled electoral opportunism. Nevertheless, they are all that residents of Sydney can cling to, even though the opposition ignores most of the real issues and holds out only a temporary palliative. Those amendments also embody the cruel deception that there is any real solution by air traffic management. There is none in the long term; 50 years of mismanagement at Mascot has put paid to that.

         The future is grim for the people of Sydney and for people near airports around Australia. The opposition may or may not block the government's plans in the Senate until the election. But after the election, even in the unlikely event of a government win, the airlines will soon subvert the Senate, just as they will in the event of a coalition government. Either way, both parties are committed to privatisation. There is therefore, as I said in the debate on the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill, no hope for any real solution in the long-term future, except by eventual redevelopment of Sydney airport—an option which is removed by privatisation.

         The residents of Sydney will have no alternative but to mount a campaign of such ferocity as to deter any intending purchaser. They do not share the minister's concern about `inconveniencing foreign investors'. This is an appalling prospect, opening up an endless and destructive war of civil disobedience, endless legal actions, ever more disruption of airline services and further millions of taxpayers' dollars wasted. Many will chose to cut their losses and move, leaving Sydney a degraded monument to this government.

         —in reply—I would just say something about the contribution of the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), the last speaker in this debate. In terms of historic position regarding the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport, I must say that in the 1970s and 1980s, when I was one of those campaigning with a good deal of energy to see a second airport built for Sydney rather than the expansion of Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways, the honourable member's protestations were somewhat muted.

         At that time the honourable member was preoccupied with fighting his great campaign to prevent the construction of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel—a project which he railed against for years, using many of the expressions he has used today in respect of what he calls the destructive effect of Kingsford Smith airport upon the urban environment of Sydney. I am still waiting for him to square away the results of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. I think he is possibly the only person who at this stage has failed to admit that that tunnel has been a great success.

         That does not mean to say that, in terms of airports, the honourable member and I do not share a good deal of the same concerns about protecting Sydney residents from the impact of airport noise. It is for that reason that the government, through this leasing process, has been committed to the development of the second airport for Sydney: an airport at Badgerys Creek, an airport funded through the bills before the parliament at the moment.

         An airport at Badgerys Creek will finally deliver an alternative to Kingsford Smith so that, in the years to come, all the planes wanting to land at and take off from what is the gateway to Australia will not be totally restricted to Kingsford Smith. Therefore, that growth that has been such a factor of the noise nuisance will have somewhere else to go. It is that alternative location which is being frustrated by the approach that the opposition have indicated they will adopt; that is, they will pursue, with their numbers in the Senate, the rejection of this legislation until such time as they can have their crazy way regarding the reopening of the east-west runway.

         In summarising for the government and in responding to the second reading debate, it is fair to say that the government's proposals for the leasing and the regulation of federal airports are acknowledged to be a really excellent way to introduce further innovation and benchmark competition into Australian airports. The government will, accordingly, have no part in cooperating with the opposition in allowing this legislation to be hijacked, especially when the hijacking of it involves such a cynical political stunt as is being attempted by the opposition in this debate. That is what their proposed amendments amount to—nothing short of a cynical political stunt.

         The opposition have said during the debate that they support the sale of the FAC airports, yet they are proposing amendments which, if accepted, would stop the process and stop it in its very tracks; they would prevent it from going ahead. Their contribution to the technical nature of the debate is really notable—because it has been a lack of contribution. Nothing of substance in terms of the technical nature of the legislation has been put forward by the opposition. We know that the shadow minister is not exactly renowned for her grip on policy, but she has truly excelled herself in this debate. I think she has probably even outdone Senator Parer for adopting views on aviation that are pre the Wright brothers.

         From the government's point of view we have to assume that, owing to the lack of serious amendments, the opposition either do not understand the legislation or, alternatively, cannot find any serious fault with it. It may be that given the political nature of their amendments they have not bothered to read or carefully study the legislation. Judging by the standard of the amendments, I think it is more likely that they have read their tea-leaves. Linking the legislation with Sydney's east-west runway represents the most spurious of all of the opposition amendments. The operation of the airport runways has absolutely nothing to do with the regulatory provisions of the Airports Bill—nothing whatsoever. This legislation relates to the leasing of airports run by the FAC, and the FAC has never been the agency that controls runway operations. I think the opposition stand condemned in the eyes of every economic commentator and every business leader as a  result of the sheer irresponsibility of the course of action that they have adopted in this debate.

         I want to say something about the east-west runway, because the operations of the runways at Kingsford Smith airport, and indeed the operations of the runways at most of the FAC airports, are determined strictly on the safety advice that is tendered to the government by the air traffic control agencies. It is very serious advice because each day these controllers, these expert safety advisers, have the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians in their hands. It is a terribly serious business. I know that Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation are very stringent and very rigorous in the standards that they set. They have legislation that imposes upon them a duty as regulators, and it is a duty that under this legislation will continue to apply post leasing.

         Each of these agencies has demonstrated very clearly that the regular use of the east-west runway would be inherently less safe—inherently less safe because it involves intersecting operations as opposed to parallel runways where there is no intersection. In addition, they have indicated that it is less efficient than parallel operations. That is a view that has not only been expressed by all of the regulatory agencies but also supported by independent safety experts, by the major Australian airlines and by the advisers to the major Australian airlines.

         These are people of qualification, of huge daily responsibility. Every minister has no option but to be guided by these safety experts. Of course, in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is saying that he knows more about aviation safety and aviation operations than Airservices Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation or, for that matter, the Department of Transport. This is the same opposition leader who yesterday falsely alleged that the government was orchestrating the blockade of Western Australia and is now seeking to orchestrate a less safe method of operating Sydney airport. Why? All because of concern over the real headland that is near and dear to his heart—the headland from Hunters Hill down to Woolwich in his electorate of Bennelong.

         There is certainly no concern about passenger safety in what he is proposing and what the opposition are proposing. Likewise, there is a complete disregard for the taxpayers who would find that the capacity, and hence the value, of Sydney airport would be slashed if we adopted the opposition amendment—slashed completely. Airservices Australia, in its expert evidence, has said that the cut in capacity could be as great as 35 per cent. Sure, you can make intersecting runways operate safely but you have to slash capacity to do it. There is no way you can operate that airport at the capacity it is designed for and operate it safely at the same time. One or other will go, and in this case both will go.

         So safety is reduced and operational capacity is reduced. Why? Because of the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of his seat of Bennelong, after his lifetime of support for the construction of the parallel runway system—every one of his constituents knows it—where he acknowledged again and again that expansion of the airport would involve a north-south axis with an elimination of traffic on the east-west runway. That is an acknowledgment he made and it is an acknowledgment inherent in all of the submissions of the New South Wales government, which were the other great proponents of the expansion of Sydney airport with the parallel runway configuration.

         I want to say something about the leasing strategy. We intend to stick to that strategy.

         Acceptance of the opposition's amendments to exclude Sydney and Sydney West would destroy the strategy. It would cut the level of bidder interest in each of the major airports and significantly reduce budget revenues. The fact is that no bidders will put forward their best bid for a lesser asset if that precludes them—they would be precluded under the cross-ownership arrangement—from subsequently bidding for Kingsford Smith. That is why the opposition's proposal to exclude Sydney from the first tranche is nothing short of economic voodooism.

         Sydney is the FAC's most valuable and attractive asset. It is the key element in the leasing strategy.

We know more on safety than CASA, Airservices Australia, BASI, the Department of Transport, Qantas and Ansett. On financial matters we know more than BZW. We know more than all the bidders.' These bidders, I might say, comprise all the major financial institutions in this country. All of them have given me the same advice: you must put Sydney in the first tranche.

Let me make it perfectly clear, so that he cannot possibly misunderstand: the attitude, utterances, recommendations, statements and press releases that I have made on this matter are all constant, all the same. It relates entirely to this: there needs to be a fair and equitable distribution of the noise burden over Sydney, and I have continually called, and will continue to call, for the reopening of the east-west runway.

         The minister talked about the issue of safety in the second reading speech. I used particular quotes. The first one was from the chief executive designate of Airservices Australia. He spoke with truth and from the heart, until he got heavied. There are some folk who are kind enough to refer to some folk in the Labor Party in government on the front bench as thugs for their behaviour. It is quite curious the number of people who make honest statements but who then are subsequently forced to retract them.

         —I want to make some observations about the amendments with regard to the position at Badgerys Creek airport and interests in western and south-western Sydney. One thing about this debate is that it has flushed out the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and exposed their lack of skill and lack of capacity as policy makers in this very important area of airport administration. Let us examine their statements on the public record. Let us expose the inconsistencies.

         When the member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition are campaigning in eastern Sydney for the seats of Lowe and Bennelong, they say two things. The first thing they say—it is reflected in the amendments—is that they want to reopen the east-west runway and that they will hold up this legislation until such time as it happens. The second thing they say in the seats of Lowe and Bennelong is that they want to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport. The Leader of the Opposition went as far as to say that he would redirect all the international traffic to Badgerys Creek.

         Those two statements in themselves are inconsistent. You cannot fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money. You cannot fast-track the airport at Sydney West without the finance. And the finance for that proposition, for that construction project, is contained in the legislation, in the private leasing of Kingsford Smith. So the opposition cannot have it both ways. They should not be going to the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong making statements and policies which are totally inconsistent; they are mutually exclusive.

         It gets worse. When they come to campaign in south-western Sydney in the seat of Macarthur, the opposition say they are in favour of a comprehensive EIS on the construction of Badgerys Creek airport. That begs the question: how long does it take to undertake the EIS on Badgerys Creek? It is a period of two to three years. A comprehensive EIS on Badgerys Creek for the construction of the new airport would take between two to three years. So how do the opposition reconcile that with their statement in the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong in east Sydney that they are in favour of fast-tracking Badgerys Creek? Do they mean fast-tracking Badgerys Creek with a two- to three-year delay?

         This again exposes the complete inconsistency in the policies of the opposition. They have been exposed because they are trying to straddle the divide of east and west Sydney. They are doing it with no concern for rational policy and no concern for good policy making. This is total and complete electoral opportunism, all driven by the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition for his own seat and base concerns about his prospects in Lowe in east Sydney and Macarthur in south-west Sydney.

         The business of reopening the east-west runway and fast-tracking Badgerys Creek is totally impossible under the terms of the amendment moved by the member for Mackellar. She somehow has a belief that it is possible to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport without money; that it is possible to build a billion dollar facility without finance. She needs to explain to the people of Australia, to the people of Sydney, how she would fast-track Badgerys Creek without the proceeds of private leasing of Kingsford Smith.

         I ask the member for Mackellar: where is the money coming from to build Badgerys Creek airport if you are going to delay indefinitely the proceeds of the private leasing of Kingsford Smith? When you next enter the electorate of Macarthur with your copilot, the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, how will you explain to the electorate the inconsistency of wanting to not only fast-track Badgerys Creek airport but also have an EIS? It is not possible. It is totally impossible.

         At least we have seen out of this debate the real fabric, the real quality, of the opposition on airport policy. It is a sign of things to come as they release other policies closer to the election. They too will lack any substance, any capacity and some of the core elements of public policy making in Australia in the 1990s. So it has been good, it has been enlightening, to flush out the Leader of the Opposition and his copilot `Wrong way Bishop' on all these issues and to expose the inconsistencies for what they are—completely unacceptable, completely opportunistic.

I might go back to the question of safety, which the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) raised. I was quoting from Mr W.

Indeed, he pointed out that the minister was partly responsible for the loss of government under Unsworth and that he is the most unpopular minister that Sydney has ever seen.

I have said right from the beginning that this legislation would be supported by the opposition provided the government agreed to our amendments. When we deal with the transitional bill we will be moving to add Adelaide to the list of airports to be included in the first tranche, which we consider to be fair and equitable as well. But in this set of amendments it is to do with excising Kingsford Smith from the privatisation until such time as those questions of the fair sharing of the burden of noise are dealt with and the east-west runway is reopened.

         As I have said all along, the minister simply says again and again things designed to confuse and abuse people who are affected. Yet the people of Sydney know that unless there is a change of government, unless we see the end of this reign of terror by this minister, they will be condemned forever to the pain and suffering they are affected by now, to the lessening of the value of their properties, to the effects on their health and safety. There has been no concern and there have been no consultations, as the member for North Sydney clearly pointed out.

         —I rise to oppose the amendments. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), reflected on the record of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, when he was a state minister. I want to say this: whatever one might say about the minister, he was not afraid to get things done in the interests of the people of New South Wales. He certainly did build a lot of roads but, unlike the Greiner government, he never put a toll on one of them. He never put a toll on any road in western Sydney. If members opposite want to abuse him for transferring hospitals in Liberal seats in the centre of Sydney out to the western suburbs, I am afraid I cannot condemn him. My electorate does not condemn him. In fact, we warmly congratulate him. I think his record will stand the test of time.

         The opposition, of course, are going to hold up the construction of the airport. They say they are the champions of noise impact. There will be a very dishonest campaign in the western suburbs of Sydney, with Liberal front organisations talking about the noise impact on the western suburbs of Sydney. This is from the same party, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) pointed out, that released 100,000 building sites, including land owned by Lady Mary Fairfax, in the western suburbs of Sydney. There could be nothing more destructive to the environment than doing that. The big difference in Badgerys Creek is that the closest significant housing is some 14 klicks away from the airport. In the western suburbs of Sydney, if the opposition want to play fast and loose on Badgerys Creek, ordinary people will see through it. They won't fall for it. Your optimism about deceiving people in the western suburbs of Sydney is misplaced.

He talked about the sorts of management practices that this government has presided over. He mentioned the fact that aircraft are required to come into Mascot at 3,000 feet above sea level. They are then sent over the loop, which he showed very ably on his map, that began after the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) introduced his so-called noise abatement program. Those aircraft are sent at 3,000 feet above sea level over the whole of the North Shore, parts of which are up to 1,000 feet above sea level. Therefore, the height that those planes fly over at 80 per cent power is almost intolerable.

         Furthermore, we have heard evidence from people who are skilled and authoritative in this area that those planes could come in at 12,000 feet, do that same loop at idle power and therefore dramatically reduce the noise. The point of the matter is that the minister deliberately instructed, deliberately oversaw, the change of patterns of landings and take-offs. Landings in particular are causing enormous concern for health, for quality of life and for valuation of property. It is quite deliberate. We can see from the comparison of maps that once upon a time there used to be a fanning out that was reasonable. Now it is all the Bennelong funnel.

I warned about it, before the election of the Wran government, in the debates in that chamber—debates, I might say, when it was proposed by a leader of the National Party that Kingsford Smith airport should be expanded with parallel runways. He pointed out all those years ago that this would eliminate east-west traffic—20 years ago. So no fair-minded person in Sydney would hold me responsible for this.

         As everyone in Sydney knows, the opposition's problem is that they have been the great advocates of this development. Everyone in Sydney knows that John Howard was urging day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out for the development of this airport. All the time I was opposing it, he was saying that it had to be built. All the time I was warning about the impact of noise down the corridor, he was saying, `No, no, no. Most people will be better off.' All the time I was saying, `Let's build Badgerys Creek instead of expanding Kingsford Smith airport,' he was saying, `No, no, no. Expand Kingsford Smith. It would be irresponsible not to. It must be expanded'—and all the time he was acknowledging the north-south axis.

Aircraft are flying an extra 52 kilometres than they would be if the east-west runway was being used, and those 52 kilometres are being flown over residential areas, which increases the risk of failure, accident or disaster.

         —I want to briefly refer to a couple of matters raised by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in this debate relating to safety and whether one should operate three runways or two at Sydney airport. The important thing to remember is what the government has been trying to do with Sydney airport—that is, to ensure that there is a safe operation at the airport, that the asset that the public has gets a good value when sold, that Sydney stays as the major international gateway to Australia and that we try to contain some of the noise around the airport.

         The member for Mitchell says that it was always envisaged that Sydney would operate with three runways rather than two. I just do not think that is quite right. Indeed, the honourable member for Mitchell—who has only taken a cursory interest in this matter from time to time—might be aware that, in the planning stages when the FAC was putting out models of what the new airport was going to look like, the models in fact had buildings where the cross-runway is. So it was obviously never the FAC's intention to run Sydney airport with three runways.

         If the member for Mitchell had taken more than a cursory interest in this matter he would also have known that the environmental approval for Sydney airport was on the basis that it would run as a parallel runway operation airport. The only time the east-west runway was to be used was if there were adverse weather conditions. It was never envisaged that it would run two north-south runways in conjunction with the east-west runway.

         All the evidence that has been supplied is that to run intersecting runways is inherently less safe than to run parallel runways. Even the member for Mitchell might be able to understand—although I know it is a pretty difficult concept for someone like him to get a handle on—that if two things are running at right angles to each other, they might actually run into each other, while if they were running parallel to each other, they would not run into each other.

With the change in the flight paths, the minister has ensured that fewer people are affected. With the sharper take-offs he has ensured that fewer people are affected.

         —Attempting to blame the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for noise resulting from the third runway is commensurate with trying to blame Bill Clinton for the Gulf War. It is blaming not only the wrong side but also the wrong administration. There are certainly a number of people around the place who can bear responsibility for the third runway and the decision to go ahead with it, but the minister at the table is certainly not one of them. He was with me shoulder to shoulder in the 1980s—and even before me, given his age—in fighting this thing to a standstill.

         If there is one person who sits in this place who can take a good deal of the blame for this it is the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). When I was the Minister for Aviation Support, day after day he and his colleagues accused me of holding up the economic progress of this country in opposing the third runway and holding the nation's economy to ransom—all, supposedly, to save my seat. But what was his view on this? Let us go back to the condemnation of himself by his own words on Tuesday, 21 March 1989 in an interview with Mike Carlton on Radio 2GB. He says in part:

        Their refusal to build the third runway over the last six and a half years has been based on their assessment of the politics of it. Their right wing numbers men openly boast that they are not going to be so stupid as to build a third runway and lose all those seats in Sydney. I have always regarded that argument, incidentally, as nonsense. I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of the area and I have always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected and in any event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event—

No. We have forgotten it. It vindicates my position on this all along.

         The critical point in all of this is November 1994. We have a pattern here that shows the use of all three runways in November 1994. The statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that was read out by the minister was based purely on the fact that if there were full use of Mascot there would have been a sharing of noise. I do not know if all people in the House at the moment can see it, but what this shows is that with a balanced spread of aircraft using three runways the noise is shared.

         The minister has not promoted that sharing process whereby the people of Bennelong were suffering the same noise level as those in the flight path of the east-west runway. What he has done is changed that and provided a configuration such as this where only the people in the Bennelong area suffer, not the people in other parts of Sydney who previously suffered noise—sharing in the process. To achieve this goal, aircraft are flying 52 kilometres over residential areas at great danger to the residents of Sydney.

         What it all means is that, irrespective of whether you are in government or we are in government, for the residents of Sydney the third runway will become a game of Russian roulette: who is in government and who is going to put what aircraft and how many over whose houses? On current traffic figures, your proposal to reopen the east-west runway would see some 16 to 20 per cent more aircraft over the east-west runway than before immediately. It would also see a gross diminution in safety because of that mad Simops proposal that operated for some years.

         The minister may well have the pleasure of playing a similar role for his leader in this next election as he played for Barrie Unsworth. He was a major figure in bringing down the Unsworth government, which, of course, was the inheritor of the Wran government. Mr Brereton was known as the pariah of the Labor Party.

         Much of this debate today has been quite entertaining. We have heard history regurgitated by people on the Labor Party side, who have put their slant on it. The bottom line is that it is the minister's decision of November 1994 that has destroyed the lives of thousands of people in Sydney. I have said to the minister again and again: it is within your power to accept these amendments, to allow the privatisation to go ahead and to enable a fair and equitable distribution of the noise factor by reopening the east-west runway. There is sufficient evidence on the record to show beyond doubt that it is perfectly safe and, indeed, advantageous to reopen it. The final piece of logic that can be said is that, when there was discussion about a third runway, it was always two runways plus a new runway equals three runways. They should be run together, and successfully together.

At that time the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) was challenging the then Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Reflecting on that leads me to think how the mighty have fallen since the beginning of 1994.

         The member for Mackellar wants to berate the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on a few issues. She has got plenty of front, plenty of hide, to do that when, over the last 18 months, no-one in this place has more comprehensively failed on policy questions than the member for Mackellar. In health, she has failed on issue after issue after issue. In her attacks on the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), there has been failure after failure after failure.

         The truth of the matter is that airport administration is not an easy public policy task. Who are they going to call on the opposition side to undertake the task? The honourable member for Mackellar. What did she come up with? These total inconsistencies. It makes for some very interesting points in the debate because members on this side of the House from east Sydney—the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Barton (Mr Punch)—and members from west Sydney—myself and the member for Chifley (Mr Price)—have spoken with one voice. It gives a total lie to the assertion by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) earlier on that there is some division. For as long as I can remember, the five people I am talking about have all had one position—that is, the construction of the third runway was inadvisable. It was not going to be good policy. It was going to have consequences that would be unacceptable in terms of urban planning and urban environment. The best course of action would have been the construction of Badgerys Creek airport in the first instance.

         My only regret in this matter is that the Minister for Transport was not in that position five or 10 years ago, because had he been we would have had Badgerys Creek up and running as Sydney's second international airport and there would have been no third runway. There is no doubt that the member for Mackellar and the member for Mitchell were supporting John Howard throughout the 1980s saying that the third runway was an essential micro-economic reform for Australia.

From the very first day they had the strongest possible support, along with Nick Greiner's government in New South Wales, for the third runway, and all the noise consequences that holds for people in the inner city. Those who are arguing against that position have been here today arguing the same position years later—the member for Watson, the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Barton, joined by myself and the member for Chifley. We have stated what we believe to be the correct position. We want to make sure that Badgerys Creek airport can be successful for the tens of thousands of jobs it offers in western Sydney, a real catalyst for tourism and manufacturing growth, and to do it in a fashion which is consistent with good urban and environmental planning in the greater west.

         What we have seen from the opposition is these propositions: campaigning in east Sydney saying that they want to reopen the east-west and holding up this legislation until that is done; saying in east Sydney and the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong that they want to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport; and assertions being made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that somehow it would be possible to transfer all the international flights to Badgerys Creek.

         What the member for Mackellar has argued throughout the debate on this amendment is that it is possible to fast-track Badgerys Creek without finance, or at least not to specify where the money would be coming from. That is a shameful position for a senior member of the opposition to take. The member for Mackellar and her copilot, the Leader of the Opposition, when they campaign in the south-west of Sydney and the seat of Macarthur, say they want a comprehensive EIS at Badgerys Creek which would involve a two- or three-year delay. Her interpretation of fast tracking is to build a two- to three-year delay into the process. This really is low grade stuff. This is low level flying in every sense.

It took effort from everybody—local government, state government and federal government representatives—to convince the minister at the table and the FAC that the runway should be at least capable of handling jumbo jets. That was not the government's original intention and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) knows that. It still is not adequate. In the process of financing and generating activity, the government has decided to use taxpayers' funds through the FAC. It has been the preferred position of local governments, elected members of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party from western Sydney to use a mixture of private funds and government funds, perhaps drawing in elements of local government and representatives of the community to construct a truly local international airport.

As to the progress at Badgerys Creek, I put the minister on notice that western Sydney residents are becoming very concerned about the lack of action and communication by your government. In the last month there has been an effort by some of your members and you to restore that situation. You need to do a whole heap more than you are doing. There are pockets of resistance rising up because people do not know what the flight paths are going to be. They cannot understand what the ultimate resolution of this problem will be.

        These amendments are in line with the amendments I moved earlier to the Airports Bill to excise Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I now propose, similarly, to excise the references to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport from the Airports (Transitional) Bill so as to effect the postponement of the privatisation until such time as the noise burden over Sydney is dealt with in a more equitable manner—in particular, until the resumption of the full operation of the east-west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been approved.

         It is also proposed in this set of amendments that the Adelaide airport be added to the list in clause 19 of the Airports (Transitional) Bill so that the provisions of that bill will apply to Adelaide airport forthwith. The reason for that amendment is to give effect to our belief that Adelaide airport ought to be treated like the other mainland capital city state airport and be in the first phase of sales of the Federal Airports Corporation. The current legislation unfairly discriminates against Adelaide airport by leaving it until the second tranche. We believe that it is only fair that it be included in that first list, and the amendment has been proposed accordingly.

         We also propose, as we did with the previous bill, an amendment to prevent the government restoring Kingsford Smith airport to the list under the Airports (Transitional) Bill and the Airports Bill, including it in the first tranche of sales. Our reason, which we argued strongly with the first bill, is exactly the same with this bill—the unfair distribution of noise concentrated over certain areas of Sydney.

         The government has argued that it cannot reopen the east-west runway because it believes that it is unsafe. That has been shown to be clearly fallacious. It is not unsafe. There is a list of experts, including the newly designated head of the government's own body oversighting air safety, who say that it is perfectly safe to conduct such an operation with intersecting runways.

         —We will not be acceding to these amendments for very good reason. Firstly, in respect of Adelaide airport I say: Adelaide airport needs to be extended and it needs to be extended prior to being leased. That is the priority of the South Australian government and it is the priority of our government. The proceeds for that extension, an extension due to commence in March of next year, come from the leasing of Sydney airport. That is where the funds are coming from. Of course, the opposition are proposing that the whole of the leasing process be wrecked by Sydney's being eliminated from the leasing process.

         So in point of fact, the only people who are discriminating against Adelaide are the opposition, by persisting with these amendments and threatening to use their numbers in the Senate to block this legislation. They are the only people who can wreck the very carefully negotiated plans between our government and the government in South Australia to see the South Australian airport extended, and extended now.

          Certainly, privatising it in the first tranche is the last thing anyone has recommended. Every bit of financial advice has said: lease the major assets first but extend Adelaide first, before it is leased. Only the opposition would in effect discriminate against Adelaide airport.

         In relation to this furphy that has been repeated by the opposition today about reopening the east-west runway, the opposition have always known that inherent in their plan to develop Kingsford Smith airport with parallel runways was the elimination of traffic on the east-west runway. They have known it for as long as this proposal has been around.

         Some of them knew it even before they were here in this chamber. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) knew it in 1975. In the New South Wales parliament, when across the chamber from me, he said that the proposal he was speaking in favour of then—that is, the parallel runway—would cater for an expansion of the traffic. An acceptance of the solution would mean that cross runways would not have to be used. You knew it in 1975. You have known it at every point.

         John Howard knew it in 1989 when he was castigating this government for not proceeding with the expansion of Kingsford Smith.

         It does the opposition no good at all to be claiming that Mr Bill Pollard, the new head of Airservices Australia, has said anything that supports their contention. In point of fact, Mr Pollard has said the opposite. What he said is, `Sure, you can run intersecting operations and they are run around the world.' But he also said, `You cannot run them at the capacity Sydney airport needs to run at to operate effectively, efficiently and to service the demand that is upon it.' And it is a very considerable demand.

         That wrecks the value of the airport, wrecks its ability to service the needs of Sydney. All of this is inherent in the proposal that is being put forward so ineptly by the shadow minister sitting opposite. It is a proposal that would destroy the value of the airports, that would destroy the ability of Badgerys Creek to be built, completed in time for the year 2000 Olympics, that would destroy our ability to proceed with the extension of Adelaide airport with the development of the new runway and would give us arrangements at Sydney airport, not only wrecking its value but destroying its capacity in rendering it less safe.

         In the minister's comments he said some things about the federal government having done so much for South Australia. He commented on the road changes in Mount Barker, which is in my electorate, and he also commented on the runway extension. Still, even though the government has done so much for South Australia, why is South Australia a second-class citizen when it comes to the sale of the Adelaide airport, the premier airport in South Australia? Why is it that the Adelaide airport cannot be in the first tranche with the other airports being sold around the country? The reason is that South Australians are second-class citizens as far as this government is concerned and have always been treated that way.

         The minister likes to hand out ugly threats about the coalition's position on this bill. He likes to say that the extension of the runway will be finished first before the sale of the airport, before the lease of the airport. If the extension is not done first, if we do not behave, if the coalition does not do what he wants us to do, then the suggestion hangs in the air that the runway extension might not go ahead.

         What the minister might like to know—he probably does know but refuses to tell the House—is that the extension has already begun in its preliminary stages in South Australia. The money allocated for that extension is a separate allocation. It has nothing to do with the successful leasing of Kingsford Smith airport. To try to link the two is a disgraceful political act.

         He also suggests that the South Australian government in some way supports the Labor Party's position on the sale of the Adelaide airport. Nothing could be further from the truth. On Tuesday of last week the shadow cabinet in Adelaide announced that they would bring forward the sale of Adelaide airport by two years and put it in the first tranche of sales. This was welcomed by the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, who supports the coalition's position and who told me personally that I should do my best to push for that in Canberra for South Australia and for the Adelaide airport. So the government cannot try to clothe itself in the popularity of the South Australian Liberal government on this issue of the Adelaide airport.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, you know my regard for you, and the role of your office. I have the choice of either waiting to make a personal explanation or trying to tidy up the matter as quickly as I can. I think the honourable member for Sturt in his contribution has misrepresented my remarks. Firstly, I had mentioned the contribution of the minister in relation to roads, and also to his shifting of hospital beds to the west. I also point out that my constituents are grateful to this minister for being the first minister, I believe, to take up seriously the issue of the construction of a major airport at Badgerys Creek—something that I have been seeking for a long time. This is the only minister who has secured a budget allocation to ensure that the construction goes ahead.

         It is quite clear to me and my constituents that this construction is contingent upon the sales that are proposed. We accept that. I strongly support the minister in that. I also support the proposition of the minister that, if the western suburbs of Sydney are to take full advantage of this airport, it is really important that it be operational, as the minister wishes it to be and as the minister has planned it to be, before the Sydney Olympics. It would be absolutely absurd to have the opening of Badgerys Creek occur after the Olympic Games.

         In the western suburbs of Sydney—maybe the honourable member for Sturt wants to take issue with me—we have supported and seen the value of this airport as a catalyst for jobs. What the opposition is doing—in my view and, I think you will find, in the view of many people in the electorates of western Sydney—is to put in jeopardy the big plus that this airport represents for us; that is, having the surety that it will open well before the Olympic Games. It will not be taking the major part of that tourist traffic, but it will be up and running and operational and it will be getting the benefit of the enormous contribution that the Olympic Games will make in my state of New South Wales. Of course, it will have benefits for the whole of Australia. I have some time for the honourable member for Sturt, but I am concerned when he misrepresents the remarks I make.

She has declined to put on the record whether or not there was any consultation by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) with the shadow minister for transport, with his shadow cabinet or with his party room. Is the shadow minister at the table confirming that there was no consultation; that this was a pre-emptive strike by the Leader of the Opposition to protect his own electorate?

         I would like to talk in this contribution about how important Adelaide airport is to South Australia, why it is that we want to bring forward the sale of the airport by two years and why the coalition announced that last Tuesday. Adelaide airport is vital to South Australia not because the length of the runway precludes its maximum use in bringing tourists to South Australia but, primarily, because the length of the runway precludes trade opportunities, exports to South-East Asia and imports from other countries.

         South-East Asia is a market for fresh food produce, which is produced in abundance in South Australia. One of the great problems in trying to get that produce to places like Singapore and Hong Kong is that the size of the planes that take off from Adelaide airport is not sufficient to make it worth while for corporations in that region to use Adelaide airport. Therefore, a market that is waiting for South Australian companies to fill with fresh food produce, amongst many other goods and services, is not being used because of the runway extension not having gone ahead under the state Labor government, although it was promised many times. So the airport is very important to South Australia and the extension of the runway is very important.

         Privatisation would be of assistance to Adelaide airport. There are people in South Australia and in Australia who are prepared to develop it into the premier airport that it should be and make it a proper and proud gateway to South Australia. Privatisation would also enhance its export potential. The South Australian government's position on privatisation, particularly on the runway extension, has been clear all along, and it has committed funds to upgrade it.

         —They are being done in the eye by you. It is worth going through the history of this question of the extension of Adelaide airport because it was a prime matter for debate at the time of the last national conference of the ALP. The ALP gave approval for the leasing process after a very strong performance by Mike Rann, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, who was insistent that something had to be done because he was faced with the prospect of the airport not being extended under the FAC's proposals until well into the next century. He was insistent that it be done and done now.

         The conference put a condition on the leasing process for all the airports that money be made available in the first tranche from a leasing process to build Adelaide airport. That is how it is being built. I might say that this was a process negotiated with John Olsen and Diana Laidlaw, and it was one that gives us the very result that is required—that is, the extension of the airport. Selling the airport without the extension does not solve any of the problems alluded to by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) about the inadequacy of the runway for international fully-laden wide bodied jet take-offs. It does not solve those problems at all.

Quite frankly, it is an enormous betrayal of the interests of the electors of South Australia by the member for Sturt who, gullibly, today stood in this House and said, `It's going to be all right because we will privatise. We won't extend.' It does not matter that the money won't be there now for the extension. It does not matter that this whole process is to be delayed. Of course, this is a great betrayal.

We are sick to death of other sly little meetings that take place in other people's houses, trying to influence the outcome of things of which we never know the consequences. We are sick to death, and the Australian people are sick to death, of the sort of hypocrisy you bring into this place, saying that you care about battlers when you could not even find one if you fell over one.

         Since when have you ever been in contact with small business people who are every day risking their very house and home in order to make interest repayments on loans they have taken out in order to conduct a small business and employ a few folk? In that area you are pretty special too. You put every encumbrance in their way to stop them from being able to employ young people. The people of Australia have had enough. We are sick to death of the fact that the Labor Party thinks it is their preserve to get rich while the people get poor. When it comes to the question of Adelaide, we are not going to wear your cant.

         —The FAC said that commercially they did believe it was within their priorities until very well into the next century. That was the FAC's position. The member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) said it in this debate. It was about the only factual thing that he said. Mike Rann went to that conference and he secured a very good outcome that was all about South Australia. Let me tell you this: there was nothing grubby about it. It was a very honourable process with a very honourable outcome. I know it; Mike Rann knows it; everyone who was at that conference knows it; everyone in South Australia knows it; and Mike Rann's political opponent, the Premier of South Australia, particularly knows it. This is what he had to say about the outcome. A media release on Premier Brown's own letterhead said:

        He was elated; he was delighted. Everyone can take great credit for this, including Mike Rann. Dean Brown was delighted and John Olsen thought it was terrific. Everyone was extraordinarily happy. But then what happened? We reach this chamber on the eve of the forthcoming election and, for the sake of a few lousy votes in John Howard's own electorate of Bennelong, the whole process is derailed. Sydney airport is excluded from the sale by an abuse of the opposition numbers in the Senate. The proceeds are not there to go on with this work. Sure, it will be extended, because we are people of our word. But there is no doubt that, because the sale will be delayed and, if they go ahead with their threat, this legislation will have to be reintroduced in the next parliament some time after the next budget, there will be a delay of at least a year in these processes. That delay will be purely and simply the work of those sitting opposite.

         The aspirations of Dean Brown, the aspirations of Mike Rann, the aspirations of the people of Adelaide and the aspirations that go right across the political course will all be dashed as a result of this act of absolute and utter stupidity by the shadow minister and John Howard. But for what? For the sake of a handful of lousy votes to try to convince people in Sydney that John Howard does not mean what he said over 20 years of active political pursuit; that is, that Kingsford Smith should be expanded and that a parallel runway should be built in the certain knowledge that its construction would involve the north-south axis. He said that again and again. He knew what he was saying. Everyone opposite and everyone in Sydney knows that this was always the position of the opposition, as it was the position of the New South Wales Liberal government.

         Their own submission to the EIS said that traffic on the east-west would be eliminated, that people would be worse off with the north-south but that it was all right because more people would be better off rather than worse off. There was always an acknowledgment—a political acknowledgment, absolutely clear, pure and simple—by everyone in the opposition and by everyone in New South Wales that this traffic was going to operate on a north-south axis, as it has to on safety and capacity considerations.

         The minister says that the aspirations of Mike Rann have been fulfilled. Big deal! For goodness sake, Mike Rann is not the Premier of South Australia and he never will be the Premier of South Australia. He was once a minister, he had his chance and he failed dismally. We are not going to let them try to ride on our wash, try to ride in on our success.

         The South Australian government, as I said before, supports the coalition's position of bringing forward the sale of Adelaide airport by two years and putting it in the first tranche. I never said that we should privatise without the extension of the Adelaide airport runway, as you claim that I did in your previous contribution. I never said that. They are separate items. The extension of the runway is in place and it is proceeding. Plans have been drawn up.

         —The money that you announced six months ago had nothing to do with the Kingsford Smith airport. You did not say that back then. The plans have been drawn up and the system of road diversions that surround the airport is under way. The money was allocated. If you are now trying to go back on that, you will pay a large price in South Australia at the next federal election.

         There is no doubt that this government stands bereft of any principle with respect to this matter and so many other issues, as I have observed in my short experience as the member for Sturt. I am disappointed in the government, as are the people of South Australia. They have every reason to be. I hope the government will reconsider its position on some of these amendments and support the coalition's position.

         —I am sure that the residents of the North Shore—whom the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has today tagged `a lousy handful of votes'—will be very pleased to know that that is the way in which they are regarded by this minister. Apparently, they are to be denied the democratic principle of being able to express their point of view, just as we have seen the minister say that a duly and properly elected government in South Australia is bypassed in the doing of an unseemly deal in a back room of a Labor Party conference, with a Labor Party apparatchik who now holds himself out to be the Leader of the Opposition.

         The government has refused to accede to our amendments. We did let these bills pass the second reading stage to give the government the opportunity to see reason and pass the amendments. We then could have allowed the bill to receive a third reading. But the government has chosen not to do that. So, accordingly, we will again be opposing this bill at the third reading stage.

         I think what has been shown in the course of this debate is, very simply, that this Labor Party is unto itself, a law alone. It has no truck, it cares not at all, for anybody who is outside its sphere of influence or the people over whom it can exert influence. As I said earlier, if you really want to remember the lengths to which this lot will go, take a look every day at Peter Baldwin's face: bashed and meant to be dead.

And all of this does not even register with the minister because he calls them `a handful of lousy votes'. Well, Minister, I suspect that there are a lot other Australians whom you consider to be `handfuls of lousy votes' who are going to rise up at the next election and just tell you what they think of you and your government.

As far as I am concerned, Minister, every individual Australian has the right to be considered. It does not matter if they belong to the same political party or not.

         —As it has been requested, I will be more than happy to do that. The two tax related amendments are being introduced to clause 45 to ensure that holders of leases over the airports will be treated in the same way for taxation purposes as if they had been granted leases by a non-tax exempt body—that is, the Federal Airports Corporation—and that lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged by becoming lessees of an airport company. Clauses 74 and 76 are being amended to clarify requirements under the Archives Act 1983, and schedule 4 is being amended to provide future flexibility on the number of members who may be appointed to the FAC board. I commend the amendments to the House.

In relation to those provisions dealing with the definition of an asset, I wonder if the minister could clarify for the House the implications of that section and that amendment on concessionary leases which are presently held. Secondly, could he tell us why we need the additional flexibility for the board of the continuing FAC? I note from the amendments that it is proposed to enlarge the size of the FAC board. I wonder why that is necessary when, in fact, they are going to have less responsibility and not more.

In respect of the second matter raised by the honourable member—that is, the question of FAC board membership—that merely allows for a variation of the numbers on the board in the future. In other words, the board does not have to comprise its full complement as the FAC proceeds down the track of its role being diminished through the disposal of the airports to the various lessees in tranche one and tranche two.

         —There are a number of points right through the whole process of both bills where ministerial responsibility is the ultimate factor. I am seeking clarification from the minister. In regard to the commercial operations of airports, will you be requiring reports where you will set the commercial thrust of what is occurring in the airport? I am seeking to clarify the minister's role. What is he expecting to do in regard to the management of each airport? Are you going to have a hands-on approach or will you expect them to operate commercially and refer only certain matters to you?

         Finally, I would like to comment on the government's failure to foster an economy which is able to absorb the young people being educated in our universities. When the Dawkins revolution was sold to the Australian public in 1988, a major argument for the changes was that Australia's young needed to be educated to fill the highly skilled positions that were to be generated under a Labor government. Parents and young people accepted this story and invested money, energy and hope in the acquisition of a university education. Too many have found that the government's sales pitch was a gross distortion of reality.

         While graduate unemployment is lower than unemployment for young people without degrees, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that graduates have simply shifted into positions formerly held by non-graduates, rather than into the highly skilled positions promised them by the Labor government. Not only is this a tragedy for the non-graduates who are pushed into unemployment by the influx of graduates into positions previously held by non-graduates; it is also a tragedy for the young graduates who worked so hard towards a dream which they are now finding to be empty.

         —I join with the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) in saying this is a very important piece of legislation. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is the sort of bill that goes to the heart of the social justice debate in which the parliament has been engaging in recent months. On that, in my experience, working people in Australia are concerned not so much with ownership issues as with skills and opportunities, and the active role of government in enhancing the economic and social capability of those genuinely in need.

         Australia's education system is at the heart of this task. I had two reminders of this recently, both of them relevant to the higher education sector. The first of them was the comments made by Rupert Murdoch, expressing concern about the development of an underclass and the high level of youth unemployment in some parts of Australia. I thought people on the coalition side had a hide in making some of their comments on social justice issues, but for someone who sponsored the Thatcherite revolution in Britain and actively supported Reaganomics in the United States to be complaining about the development of an underclass is, indeed, exceptionally rich.

         that the average TER—the equivalent these days of what had been known as the HSC—mark was twice as high in the north shore and eastern suburbs of Sydney than in western Sydney and south-western Sydney. The interesting thing about those figures—of course, they are in relation to school education—is that once people from western and south-western Sydney gain entry to university they do as well as people from any other part of Sydney.

         This reinforces the importance of the link between higher education and school education and, in both sectors, the importance of the home learning environment. It is very important to broaden our concept of education beyond formal institutions, be they school education or higher education, to include the home learning environment where issues of advantage and disadvantage are so important.

         I outline four principles that I believe are significant in the parliament's consideration of higher education in Australia. The first of those principles, of course, is the need for quality outcomes. What we have found, with the internationalisation of the Australian economy, is that all factors of production have now become mobile, except human skills.

         In many respects, the quality of human skills determines a nation's wealth. The new growth theorists, who are becoming very popular in economic debates and forums, have emphasised the importance of a culture of innovation in a country in order to have successful trading and economic arrangements. A culture of entrepreneurship is very important for a nation's economic success. Higher education in Australia should be at the absolute vanguard of the shift in culture.

         Also, I think, on the issue of social values and leadership our universities need to play a more prominent role in the public debate. I was recently part of the parliament's delegation to the European parliament. As part of that, we listened to Chancellor Kohl, the German Chancellor, at the Council of Europe. He explained how all Western societies have an opportunity, in the 1990s and beyond, to define our societies by combining `the humanism of antiquity with the rationalism of our times'. That is a beautiful phrase and a beautiful set of ideals and values that are all about excellence, quality, compassion and a more enlightened society. Our universities should be at the absolute vanguard of defining such values and actively promoting their worth throughout all parts of Australian society.

         The second principle I would define for the higher education sector is in terms of responsiveness to economic change and responsiveness to the internationalisation of the Australian economy. I have used this example in the parliament previously but I think it is worth repeating. Alcatel is a telecommunications company just to the north of my electorate. Its training cycle, its education cycle, is of just six months duration. Because of rapid technological change in that industry the company cannot sensibly plan ahead for the training needs of its staff for any more than six months.

         This emphasises the problem for those in school or higher education who want to focus excessively on fixed content. I notice that Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, is trying to focus on content. Content, of course, is always changing as technology and our economy change in response to international pressures. In many respects, with regard to fixed content in the curriculum of schools or universities, once people leave those institutions they remember very little of the content they picked up at school or university. The way of learning is all important and that is really where our universities should be placing more emphasis.

         Are our universities in Australia responsive to these influences? Are they responsive to the sorts of economic and social changes that Australia has gone through over the last 10 to 15 years? I have some reservations about institutions that are based on guaranteed income, institutions that are based on tenure—that is, guaranteed employment for staff no matter the quality of their outcomes. I have reservations about outdated management methods in the university sector in Australia. Our universities, essentially, are based on 19th century small `l' liberal values embracing diversity at any cost, a belief in learning for the sake of learning and a feudal protection of tenure and academic freedom.

         It is my very strong belief that our nation, with the challenges it faces over coming decades, needs much more than learning for learning's sake. We need learning and skills that are relevant to our economic position and our social requirements. This is where universities have such an important role to play. They must be relevant to the economy and, of course, provide social leadership in terms of promoting more enlightened social values.

         The third principle I will address is this issue of a lifetime commitment to education. I think it is a peculiar thing in Australia—indeed, it is an unusual thing—when we look at some of our trading competitors. In Australia, education is seen as something that people undertake until their early 20s and it is somewhat of a task. What we need in Australia is an ethos of continuous, lifelong education throughout all parts of the population. There must be continuous updating of the skills and knowledge required for people to be successful in internationalised economic arrangements, successful in a post-industrial society.

         The fourth question I will raise—and I mentioned this earlier on—is equity, the problem of intergenerational disadvantage in our post-industrial society. We really do need to tackle the fact that, while our schools can have a disadvantaged schools program and while we can have equity funding for universities, we need to link those initiatives to the home learning environment. That is the root cause of educational disadvantage in Australia in the 1990s. New forms of information technology are the great opportunity for linking the home and the formal learning environment.

         Some of these methods may be intensive in their case management. Some of these methods may be expensive in their case management and their administration for government, but it is an expense that is well worth meeting if we are to meet the challenge of a more inclusive society. If we are to find the sorts of remedies that Rupert Murdoch would press upon us in his pious complaints then we should realise that ever smaller government is not the answer. Some of these remedies have a fiscal cost. Those who want to argue the case for social justice and a more inclusive society should be willing to meet the cost. It is important to recognise those realities. Smaller government is not an answer when it comes to building a more inclusive, a more socially just Australia.

         I would suggest also that universities should be more active in addressing these issues of educational inequity and educational disadvantage. I was quite inspired to read a comment from a speech by the late Mr Peter Wilenski, one of the great educational administrators and reformers in Australia's history. He made the speech in my part of Sydney at the University of Western Sydney, in its formative days, on 10 October 1987. I think it is a very good statement to provide to the parliament. He stated:

        Issues of equity of access should not be afterthoughts forced on a university by reformist governments. They go to the heart of what a university is about. The socioeconomic maldistribution in our university student population, the fact that children of poor parents are many more times unlikely to go to university than children of equal ability from wealthy families, represents not only a major social injustice and enormous waste of talent for society, but also a deviation from the pursuit of excellence by universities who as a result have less than the best students. It is little wonder that the half of the community which is less advantaged has not come to the defence of the universities when the universities appear to have so little relevance to their lives or those of their children. Of course, the fault lies to a large extent with the pre-university education system but universities can have a major role in influencing that system.

        There are big challenges for higher education in Australia in meeting each of these four principles. I was delighted to learn that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has appointed a higher education management review team which is due to report in December. I also noticed with some degree of interest that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and some of the other authorities in higher education were very concerned about the fact that there would be an external review of their relevance to our economic arrangements and to the training and skill requirements in Australia.

         I think it is a good sign that the universities are apprehensive about the external review. They should not be immune from the review process—the sort of reform, the sort of initiative that has affected all sections of our society, the school education system, TAFE, and all forms of learning. Universities should not be sheltered away, hiding behind walls of academic tenure and attempts to secure academic freedom at any cost.

         The legislation before the House is interesting and very important because it addresses some of these key issues of equity in the distribution of resources between states and the distribution of resources by the federal government between universities. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) makes amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to adjust funding levels as a result of the allocation of new places, additional research funds, carry forward of quality funds and the inclusion of funding for 1997 and 1998.

         Funding will be provided to close to 6,000 new higher education places, plus those in the pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998 to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will be a major beneficiary of these places, as will New South Wales and Western Australia. They will also be receiving additional places. I am delighted—I note that my colleague the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is at the table—that the University of Western Sydney has been a major beneficiary of the additional growth allocation in New South Wales.

         I congratulate the minister, Mr Simon Crean, on his initiative. He is a minister who is prepared to take on the difficult public policy task of redistributing much needed university resources to areas of rapid population growth like the west and south-west of Sydney to areas like our region which has low participation rates for tertiary education. Good on Simon Crean for doing these things. I look forward to the formalisation of this type of funding formula, to build into the institutions this sense of redistribution. We have a changing economy, changing growth in population and changing social needs. A region such as greater western Sydney should never be overlooked as part of that process.

         The package provides the consideration given to faster growing regions with low rates of tertiary participation. The challenge now is to institutionalise these transfers in the higher education funding formulas. The model adopted in 1990 by the government served as an aggregate historical cost system adjusted through teaching and research related cost components. Added to this base level is approved funding for growth. Once growth has been allocated it becomes part of the base for the following year of the rolling triennium: that is, each university's funding generally equals last year's base, adjusted for changes in the teaching profile and research requirement, plus a growth component.

         Under these arrangements, the arrangements that the minister has now altered, it was very difficult to move resources between institutions. The tendency was to entrench the funding position of larger, older universities and aggravate the financial challenge facing newer universities in regions of rapid population growth. Only the redistribution of public resources can ensure that the rate of population growth in outer metropolitan areas such as my seat in the south-west of Sydney is matched by the growth in government services. Politically this is never a simple task. Entrenched interest will fight hard, even academics will fight hard, to preserve existing facilities and benefits compared to regions which have gone without and are struggling to secure new services. Nowhere are vested interests more entrenched than in Australia's universities. The mystique of research and administrative autonomy has produced a feeling that somehow universities should be treated differently from other areas of public policy.

         The second initiative is to make sure that population growth in outer metropolitan areas is accommodated by growth in outer metropolitan universities, not inner city institutions. I noted that the joint DEET-Higher Education Council working party at the end of last year expressed a remarkable view. This is what the discussion paper had to say:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is not considered that all, or even most, of the resources made available to a State should automatically be allocated to regional institutions in areas of high population growth or low participation in higher education. In the major capital cities in particular, a number of universities will be in commuting distance for most students. There is no reason to exclude institutions in inner city areas, for example, from access to additional resources simply because of their location . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        What the discussion paper is effectively saying is that location is not relevant. Try telling that to a university aspirant living in my electorate in Campbelltown, where in driving time people are closer to Goulburn than they are to Sydney University or the University of New South Wales. Try telling that to the thousands of students in that region of the 1970s and 1980s—I was one of them—who did not have a university in their part of Sydney and had to commute for 1 1/2 hours one way, three hours each day, to Camperdown for Sydney University or to Kensington for the University of New South Wales. The travelling time and the expense were a great disadvantage, a great hardship to the students of Sydney's west and south-west.

         It is my very strong belief, as it is within the government, that resources for regions of fast population growth need to be allocated to the universities which directly service those regions. I reject this spurious argument that somehow inner city institutions can equitably and fairly service the needs of university students on the urban fringe. The DEET-HEC approach would impose large costs in travel time and expenses on students from outer metropolitan areas. It does not sit well with policies to provide equality of higher education opportunity. The 1994 ALP national conference resolved to develop a series of social justice benchmarks on access and equity issues. Higher education funding should set basic standards for the availability of university places and reducing the time and expenses faced by student commuters, particularly those at the urban fringe.

         My third initiative would be to develop funding formulas on the basis of regional rather than state needs. The DEET-HEC discussion paper used state boundaries as its unit of locational analysis. This contradicts the government's general support for regionalism and funding arrangements that support regional equity. Real geographic distinctions in Australia are regional, not between the states. State boundaries—lines drawn in at Whitehall last century—have shown themselves to be an irrelevant guide to locational inequality. For instance, while the New South Wales population is projected to fall, some parts of the state, such as the north coast and also the south-west of Sydney, face some of the highest rates of population growth in all of Australia.

         My fourth initiative—and I trust the minister is keen on this idea—is to build socioeconomic indicators and notions of regionality into the higher education funding formulas. The Kelty report on regional development in 1993 recommended the government should take into account the regional services provided by higher education institutions when assessing their eligibility for funding.

         The availability of skilled labour is now arguably the single most important determinant of regional competitiveness. Educational agendas can be tuned to regional agendas while also addressing international competitiveness, thus becoming important instruments for economic development. Funding allocations to support these objectives can be tied to specific projects or linked to broader notions of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage at a regional level.

         The development of these indicators for higher education funding would present few difficulties. The ABS has done significant work on the measurement of socioeconomic conditions by geographic areas. The major challenge in applying these indices lies in the relationship of a higher education institution to its student catchment area. There would be little purpose in providing growth funds to an institution to increase regional participation if the bulk of students came from outside the region. It would first be necessary to establish the proportion of students of each institution which is drawn from the regional catchment. Big challenges, a good bill and good work on the part of the minister.

He did not speak much about the HECS debt contribution scheme. He did not speak much at all on the voluntary threshold for repayment of the HECS debt, setting new income thresholds at which people become liable to repay their HECS debts, introducing a mandatory up-front payment for HECS for certain New Zealanders and non-citizens, and removing the HECS exemption scholarships for the professional development of teachers.

Far too often, for far too long, we have heard a tirade of Labor government rhetoric, reaction and, in some ways, rhubarb.

That is the money course: the yellow brick road to revenue collection.

         It seems that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has taken a shine to all things foreign—foreign debt, foreign students, foreign clocks, and foreign suits in some cases. So the government clan has decided that there is real loot to be made by having these `foreigners' studying in the Australian education system. The government has decided, in its so-called wisdom, that it will have a mandatory up-front payment for all education fees paid by non-citizens—notice that I was careful to avoid that word `foreign'—or permanent Australian residents who do not take out Australian citizenship. This has been designed to stop people from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving the country without paying their HECS.

But they also need to know what it will cost and when. Reality dictates that very few people—I stress very few—can afford an up-front payment.

However, as you probably realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am a bit of a pragmatist, and if this payment is to be put in place, regardless of the potential for resistance by overseas students, it must not be used to the detriment of existing students.

         The bill has another slight hoax in the making. In most bills presented by the Labor government, there seems to be some point that relates to money collection. This one is no exception. It may be couched in different terms, but the reality always seems to shine through. The government has actively encouraged students to move into tertiary education. It has done this, firstly, through their inability to provide jobs and openings in the employment sector for young people and, secondly, by encouraging most employers to consider only those people with training or academic qualifications as worthwhile employees.

Part 9, establishing a discount for people who commence HECS repayments before reaching the compulsory threshold, also deserves more than a cursory glance.

The students are in a totally vulnerable position. Two years ago, the government tried to do the same thing, and I raised the same issues then.

A student cannot start a law, arts or science degree and, when the government jacks up the HECS to be paid back through the tax system, then say, `Right; it's time for me to move on, I'm not going to complete my degree.' Obviously, the government has complete power over that student while ever the student is studying at university and it can change the student's HECS at will.

It is estimated that around half of these meet the residency requirements that allow them to defer their HECS, and that most of the remainder will take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year, leaving only around 2,200 liable for up-front fees.

         Under this bill, overseas students from countries which permit dual citizenship—for example, Hong Kong—would have little difficulty in taking out Australian citizenship and returning to their country of origin, leaving their HECS debt unpaid. At the same time, the bill creates hardship for students from those countries—for example, Malaysia—that do not allow dual citizenship, who may need to retain the citizenship of their original country for a variety of reasons. So we are creating two classes of overseas students in Australia: those who will be able to avoid the government's proposals, and those who will have to make a choice and possibly suffer deleterious effects by so doing.

It appears to be a particularly cumbersome method of saving what are relatively small amounts, and when the potential for rorting that will still exist is considered it may well prove unable to even match this much. The amounts claimed are $3.8 million and $1.8 million. Only yesterday, I heard from a report that was tabled by the Australian National Audit Office that the Department of Social Security could save $86 million by changing some of the systems that it has adopted. Yet the government is happy to punish students and make their lives almost impossible and is happy to have legislation which is still full of loopholes and which students will still be able to get around—all for a measly $3.8 million and $1.8 million, when they will not make the changes that would save $86 million in the DSS!

         Rather than applying this measure to current students, the coalition is again seeking to amend it so that it will only affect students commencing studies in 1996. I should also mention in passing that part 4 of the bill makes provision for a discount to be offered to students and recent students who voluntarily commence the repayment of their HECS debt when their income reaches $20,000 per annum rather than when it reaches the current level, which is $26,853. Persons who are tempted by this discount to attempt to repay HECS while on incomes of this level may well find they lack the economic capacity to continue.

         More concerning is that fears have been expressed that this measure may well be the first step towards lowering the compulsory threshold. In other words, it may be the thin end of the wedge. Who can trust this government on HECS, on how they deal with tertiary students, when at almost every opportunity they have had to break a promise to students they have broken it? They have said it will be voluntary if you want to repay your HECS when you are earning less than $26,853. How long will it be before they lower the compulsory threshold, before they say, `So many people are able to do so voluntarily, we will make it compulsory for everyone'? It is a very dangerous situation for students to be in when they are faced with a government that has no regard for the contract signed with students. These three aspects all demonstrate the weaknesses of the existing HECS. As I said earlier, it is inequitable and it denies its participants any real sense of certainty.

         Where are the NUS on the issue? Why is it that the National Union of Students have absolutely no capacity to defend students against this government? They are hopelessly inadequate. The reason they are hopelessly inadequate is that they are an arm of the ALP government and the government takes them utterly for granted. As they have demonstrated in election after election, they are more than prepared to campaign for and support the Labor Party, even though the Labor Party constantly humiliates them, takes them for granted, uses them up and spits them out. The NUS should be ashamed of themselves. It is high time they started representing students rather than representing their own ambitions for factional advancement.

         Under HECS, students contribute around one-fifth of the average cost of a higher education place. Each semester, students choose either to pay up-front or to defer payment. Students who can pay their fees directly to the institution receive a discounted fee, with the Commonwealth paying the balance on their behalf. Students who defer payment accept a loan from the Commonwealth which pays their liability for the semester to the institution, and they begin repaying these loans when their taxable income reaches a certain level.

         When students sign up for the payment options form, everything is fine if they can afford to pay up-front. But, if they choose to pay later, they are signing a weighted contract with a party that can change its conditions and does so at whim. Such a situation would not be tolerated in the private sector. It is only government that allows such abuses to take place. However, students have no choice. They can either sign the form or they can forget about their education. I do not believe that I need to spell out to the House who benefits and who loses from such a situation. If you can afford to pay HECS up-front, it is all well and good. But students who cannot afford to pay sign a contract with a party that can increase repayments and can change conditions of the contract at any time. As HECS currently exists, it discriminates against the less well off and the underprivileged.

Too many young people have learnt over recent years that a degree or other tertiary qualification is scarcely a ticket for a job. Yet at a time when budgeting is vital, when they are establishing careers, when they are getting married, saving for a deposit on a home or incurring a mortgage, the government can suddenly—and does—increase their repayments.

It is particularly unfair to present and future students from rural and remote Australia who are already greatly disadvantaged in terms of their access to educational opportunities.

In deciding to undertake a course of study a student will often sacrifice immediate comforts and financial rewards in favour of the opportunity of a better and higher paid job in later life. Entering a university also involves planning for such things as accommodation and travel, and often the need to seek and undertake part-time work.

         I am particularly concerned by Labor's proposed changes in the bill which will impact very heavily on students and families from rural and remote Australia. Many of these young people and their families are already burdened by unique financial and social pressures. Drought has seriously cut the incomes of thousands of rural families. For example, more than half the broadacre livestock enterprises in this country have had a negative income for the last three years. In my own electorate of Maranoa, many broadacre producers have recorded substantial negative incomes for the last four years. When their financial returns for the coming 12 months are recorded, the way the season looks, there will be another year of negative incomes.

If you compare that with the median income of families in the seat of Brisbane, you will see that it has a median family income of $35,909. It illustrates my point that, based on official statistics from 1991, the parents of students from rural and remote areas of Australia, as a result of their backgrounds, have a lower median family income than the families of students from our capital cities.

The median family income in the electorate of Greenway, a safe Labor seat in western Sydney, however, is $40,365.

         Rural families will have even less money to live on and to keep their farms and businesses going if the government gets its way and increases the tax on those graduates who have been fortunate enough to get a decent job. This in turn will make it more difficult to pay for the education costs of the next generation. With declining incomes and increased taxes, farming families also have less opportunity to pay up-front fees for higher education and so escape these HECS increases.

         The situation created by the legislation is typical of Labor's approach to education, and particularly to the education of rural and remote Australians. After 13 years the Labor Party has demonstrated that it has no commitment to providing a fair deal for rural students. In 1993, the year 12 retention rate for students in urban areas was 66 per cent, but for students who live in remote areas the figure was only 52 per cent. A similar story can be told with respect to higher education. In 1989, the number of students enrolled in higher education who came from urban based locations was 78 per cent of the total. This meant that rural and remote students filled only 22 per cent of the total of all higher education places.

But these hopes have been dashed. The overall participation rate of rural and remote students in higher education actually fell in the years following the report. Despite the government's commitment to providing equity in education, only 21 per cent of all higher education students in 1991 came from rural and remote Australia. Yet the total for the non-urban population of Australia was actually above 30 per cent. But the story is even worse for those students living in the really remote areas of this country. In the 1991 census the population of remote Australia was 12 per cent, but the percentage of remote students enrolled in higher education was only two per cent.

         A 1994 report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training revealed that this situation has not improved. It is important to note that the most common reasons given for this low participation rate are locational disadvantages and financial restrictions. In other words, it had nothing to do with the demand for these places and it had nothing to do with ability. But remember the minister's words: `All Australians with the potential to succeed . . . should have the opportunity to benefit from higher education . . . ' Well, rural and remote students have done all they can. They have demonstrated that they have the potential to succeed in higher education, but this government has failed to give them the opportunity.

         What is more, it is unlikely that this opportunity will ever be provided by this government. While demand for tertiary places is at an all-time high, Commonwealth student assistance has been substantially reduced. Following the May budget this year, Austudy assistance is also set to decrease by $35 million over four years. This comes at a time when access to higher education is becoming increasingly difficult for lower income groups. In 1980, under a coalition government, 48 per cent of students from the least affluent sector of the population entered higher education. In 1989, under a Labor Party government that had been in office for six years, the percentage had fallen to 35 per cent. Students from rural areas are increasingly falling into this lower income group.

         The Labor government has paid insufficient attention to the falling participation rates of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. One need only look at Labor's farm assets test which now excludes—and this is a DPIE figure included in a Senate report last year—about 5,400 students from receiving Austudy support. That is a federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy figure, not my figure. This means there are 5,400 students prevented from receiving a tertiary education. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have only to look at the figures I quoted earlier—four years of negative farm incomes—which means that many of those families are unable to provide financial assistance to these students to keep them in higher education.

         The upshot of all this is that rural students are hamstrung by the restrictive and inequitable education policies of the Labor government. The bill before us today is only going to worsen that disability. Yet quality education is of vital economic and social importance to all Australians, including rural communities. We are all only too aware that many in our rural and remote regions are in a serious state of decline. Depriving the best and the brightest in these regions of adequate education is not the way to reverse this trend. Rural and remote Australia requires innovative ideas and increased opportunities to unlock its great potential. A highly educated and well trained rural population can contribute to this task. But this requires a commitment to providing access for rural and remote Australians to higher education places. Obviously, this government does not have that commitment. These changes to HECS will only represent another obstacle to students and families hoping to obtain a higher education.

         This bill is important for two reasons: firstly, it contains a number of measures that will impact significantly on both current tertiary students and recent graduates and, secondly, it dispels once and for all the great myth that only the Labor Party can look after the interests of students. Labor politicians and their student union lackeys on campuses throughout Australia continue to peddle the myth that only the ALP can look after the interests of students. However, if you take a quick look back over the last 12 years of federal Labor government, you begin to wonder what students have to be thankful for.

         Let us examine some of these myths. The first myth I wish to dispel is in regard to university fees. When Labor first came to office in 1983, it promoted itself as being the no fees party, and I stress that point. We were told that free tertiary education was part of the Labor manifesto. In 1988 the Labor Party introduced HECS, and it was forced to remodel itself, to reinvent itself, as the no up-front fees party. So it moved from the no fees party to the no up-front fees party. We were told that no up-front fees were part of the Labor manifesto. Then the Keating government removed restrictions on universities charging fees for postgraduate courses—much to the anger of students right across Australia because they could see what was coming later.

         Suddenly, the Labor Party became the no up-front fees for undergraduates party. So it moved from a no fees party to a no up-front fees party to a no up-front fees for undergraduates party. We were told that no up-front fees for undergraduates were part of the Labor manifesto. In 1995, as contained in the bill before us today, the Labor Party wants to introduce up-front fees for at least one category of undergraduate students: those permanent residents who are not Australian citizens. So the ALP manifesto is now no up-front fees for Australian undergraduates.

         With this trail of broken promises on the fee paying structure issue, how would any students trust this government again? What will be the little variation in the next budget or the budget after that, should the Labor Party be fortunate enough to be re-elected? Having singled out one category of undergraduate students to pay up-front fees, how long will it be before this Labor government finds another group of undergraduates who should be paying up-front fees for their tertiary education? That is the very point I made when universities were allowed to charge for postgraduate courses.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Let us look at the second myth. Labor's fee paying hypocrisy is not just limited to up-front fees. If we look in detail at the Labor record on HECS, we find that the government has moved to gain more and more revenue from students. Since the 1993 election, Labor has either introduced or attempted to introduce double HECS for undergraduate degrees; 1 1/2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; a pro rata repayment, a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; a lower repayment threshold; a raised rate of repayment across the board; and a changed method of repayment. The coalition has been successful in blocking a number of these proposals, including the doubling of HECS, the 1 1/2 times HECS and the pro rata payments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Before us today in the context of this bill, the government is seeking to introduce some further revenue grabbing measures that students need to be aware of. In particular, I refer to part 4 of the bill, which makes provision for a discount to be offered to persons who voluntarily commence to repay their HECS debt when on an income of $20,000. Of course, the current threshold at which HECS must be paid is $26,853. Not surprisingly, the National Union of Students has expressed fears that this could be the first step towards the government lowering the compulsory repayment threshold. What a tragedy that would be under a Labor government which is supposed to be looking after their interests.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Part 5 of the bill provides for three new repayment thresholds for HECS. These new threshold levels, at 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and six per cent, will be inserted within the existing levels of three per cent, four per cent and five per cent, effectively accelerating the rate of repayment. Students around Australia should note that it was a Labor government that introduced this measure to increase HECS revenue by stealth. Once again, it is a Labor government that is changing the rules on students and on recent graduates by now asking them to pay back more of their debt at a faster rate.

         In fact, this is the second time in three years that Labor has sought to accelerate the rate of repayment of HECS. This altering of the rules is of great concern. A graduate battling to buy a house, to marry or to establish a career can suddenly find that his or her HECS debt repayments are suddenly increased, causing financial hardship and stress.

They are seeking to pay off a car or, as I have said before, they may be trying to buy a house or a unit, to marry or to establish a career. The coalition will move an amendment to part 5 of the bill to ensure that the new student threshold levels will apply to only those students who commence their studies from 1996 onwards. What we are about is creating certainty for students—not changing the rules here and there to suit the government's budget shortfalls.

         Part 9 of the bill requires permanent residents, including New Zealand citizens, who have met the residency requirements of citizenship one year or more before enrolment to pay up-front fees—in other words, to prevent persons from overseas undertaking education in Australia and then leaving without ever paying their HECS debt. This seems to be fair and logical, but that is hardly the way the government has gone about achieving that aim. Like for part 5 of the bill, we will move an amendment to this measure to ensure it does not affect students already enrolled but so that future students—that is, from 1996 onwards—are aware of the new rules, are aware of what they will be paying.

         DEET estimates that the coalition's amendments could cost the government about $20 million over three years in forgone revenue. That is $20 million less the government would be able to rake in from students' pockets if the bill remained unchanged. On the face of it, $20 million sounds a lot of money. But, when you talk about $20 million in the totality of the higher education budget of $4.4 billion, you are talking about roughly less than half of one per cent. In case the minister or his Labor colleagues have not heard, most Queensland universities, especially regional institutions such as Central Queensland University, are still not happy with the original allocation because they have simply not received enough places.

         This brings me to the third Labor myth which I seek to dispel, and that is in relation to university places. The student to population ratio in my Central Queensland electorate was, until recently, less than half the national average. With the minister's new allocation—if indeed it takes place, if this threat is not invoked—it will be about 60 per cent of the national average; yet my region continues to be grossly under-funded in terms of university places.

         Even with the government's much heralded budget allocation of 4,200 extra university places over three years, the Central Queensland University appears to me not to be getting its fair share of the funding cake. Our allocations for 1996 and 1997 were 420 extra places; but 100 of these were announced previously by the minister's predecessor, Kim Beazley. So, out of the recent budget, CQU got 320 places over two years to be distributed between five campuses. Think about that, Minister: two years, five campuses—10 units, if you like—into 320 places.

For 20- to 24-year-olds it is 23.4 per cent, which is the worst in Queensland. Total unemployment spread over all the state and all age groups is at 15.9 per cent, up from 14.3 per cent.

         While I acknowledge that an increase in university places would have only a minor effect on this, and while I appreciate that the minister has said he will cooperate with me on unemployment and workplace measures to alleviate this problem, nevertheless we could do with more university places. There is an interesting quote from Professor Geoff Wilson, who wrote to me recently. He said:

        As I said, 320 places over five campuses over two years is not a big deal. Indeed we are grateful for them, but I think we can do more. How, on such a paltry number and with Queensland still so far behind the other states, could you threaten to withdraw them if you do not get your way on those two minor amendments? I find that very hard to understand. I quote again from a recent letter to me from the Vice-Chancellor of Central Queensland University, Professor Wilson:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . .

         We did not cut funding to higher education. We did not introduce up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. We did not reallocate existing places from one state to another. We honoured our commitments in relation to HECS so far as Australian students are concerned. We did not increase the size of the HECS burden—the debt. We did not lower the first compulsory repayment threshold below average weekly earnings, and we did not introduce a differential HECS.

         This was a package that was funded by two basic approaches. First, there was a reallocation of existing funds available to higher education through the National Priority (Reserve) Fund. Second, there were some savings measures introduced, two of which are under attack today by the opposition. The resultant package reflected what became known as a cocktail approach to funding the higher education sector, and it was developed in full consultation with the higher education sector last year and this year. It was embraced by them as the sensible way forward.

         Again I remind the House: it was Labor that undertook the consultation. Despite what the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) said about listening to the higher education sector, the opposition consulted no-one when they took this stance of opposing the amendments. They did not consult the AVCC, which  has welcomed the package and which has since attacked the opposition for the very things that they are opposing. They did not consult the academic bodies, which again welcomed the package. Even the students, while opposing the citizenship measure, recognised the strength of the package before the House. The opposition claim the right to represent the sector, but they will not even talk to it. As a consequence, this package is now in danger of being unravelled by the Liberal Party. It is opportunism at its best; it is policy at its very worst.

         The opposition is seeking to undermine two important funding areas. Its proposals are a direct attack on the places which have been secured for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. Again, I will correct the member for Hinkler. The savings measures risks involve up to $20 million per year—not over three years. It is $50 million over three years. I do not know who has been feeding him the information on his side of the House, but $50 million is not an insignificant amount. It will see 2,000 places in jeopardy.The new places in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania will have to be reduced and places reallocated from Victoria and South Australia. So to the member for Hinkler I say: do not come in here crying crocodile tears about needing to get extra places in your own area, which has been a beneficiary of the new places we have offered. Do not come in crying crocodile tears and supporting this nonsense on your side of the House.

These new places will enable students to complete the full three years of a degree in Bundaberg for the first time. They were not able to do it before. These are the places you are now putting at risk. I do not think you understand the consequences of what you and those on your side of the House are really supporting.

         The cocktail approach developed in the resource allocation consultations last year also proposed the reallocation of places from those states with higher levels of participation.

         On the question of this citizenship issue, let me just state the record to the House. Migrants to this country have immediate access to the higher education system. Under the proposed legislation they have three years in which to take out citizenship. That is three years—I remind the House that it is possible to complete a degree in three years—for which they can defer HECS. And on top of that they can also be eligible for Austudy. No other country in the world is as generous as we are in relation to non-citizens. We are miles in front.

         It is also nonsense to imply that the measure itself is the beginning of up-front fees for Australian higher education. Our proposal does not require non-citizens to pay full fees for their university education. They will only pay up-front HECS. As we all know, HECS is equivalent to only one-fifth of average course costs. The Australian taxpayer pays the other four-fifths for these people who are non-citizens and, through HECS, funds are returned to the higher education system for the provision of additional places—places for Australian students. So why should we not make non-citizens do the same?

         This is a case of double standards on your part. On the one hand, the member for Goldstein says permanent residents who are not Australian citizens should not have to pay their HECS up front, yet he then complains that overseas students are taking places from Australian students. He is on the record as saying that 40,000 overseas students are taking up places in our Australian universities while the Australian students find the doors barred against them. That is absolute nonsense because he knows that the overseas students pay full fees, 100 per cent fees, to enter our universities. They do not do it at the expense of our students because universities require them to pay the full cost of the degree, including the capital costs. The students who pay to come to this country from overseas to study are not subsidised by public funds in any way.

Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the Australian ambassador to the United States, Dr Don Russell, has today added to his extraordinarily improper statements by attacking the Clinton administration for having no concern for the underclass in the United States?  Is it indeed the government's policy to attack the Clinton administration in this way? If not, will the minister ensure that the ambassador is reprimanded, yet again, by the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?

We had the opposition spokesman on trade, the Leader of the National Party, saying it was a terrible thing that Don Russell was coming home, because he had done such a fine job, such an excellent job, as the ambassador to the United States—a position which we thoroughly endorse. We would agree with that. Then we have various other spokespersons for the opposition, including the gentleman who asked me the question, saying he ought to be recalled immediately. For two years we sustained, as ambassador to the United States, a person who had been a Liberal Party minister, and our treatment of Liberal Party appointees was very generous indeed and decent.

As far as the Clinton administration's position on the poor in the United States is concerned, the whole position in the United States was put most effectively by the US Labor secretary in recent times. Whilst there had been a slightly better employment performance in the United States than in Europe at that gathering at the OECD where he held these discussions, when you looked at the situation of wages in the United States you had to say there was an extraordinarily large number of working poor and that poverty was a very substantial problem in that nation.

         As a simple point of analysis, if you compare the performance in Australia over the last decade in terms of distribution of income with the situation in the United States—and both of us have been through a similar deregulatory program, similar deregulatory policies—in Australia we have nevertheless sustained the position of those in society most likely to be affected by it and there has been no increase in that gap between the rich and the poor. In the United States that is not the case. The rich have got a great deal richer and the poor a deal poorer over that period of time.

In the report, he insists that nothing has changed about his industrial relations proposals since he developed them four full long years ago. He said that nothing has changed. That is well before newspaper headlines on John Howard referred to Western Australia being his very model, his very template.

         —This is a product of some banter, is it? The honourable member is an expert in banter. I have already answered this question once publicly today, which is fair enough. I will go through it again here, which is fair enough too. The position with the Governor-General's finances is that the office is responsible, like any other government department or agency, for its own administration within the framework of guidelines by the Department of Finance. As far as we are concerned, there are no problems with the administration within the framework of the guidelines that are laid down by them. The finance department does not administer the departments of the Commonwealth. It is obviously ridiculous to assume that it does. All the restrictions that apply via those guidelines apply to the Governor-General's Office. For example, they are subject to the efficiency dividend in their running costs, as are the other departments which are responsible in observing Department of Finance guidelines.

         I have had a chance to look at the article in the newspapers today. The answers to the story go reasonably as follows: firstly, there was obviously no account taken by the journalist concerned of the ordinary increases in expenditure that flow from wage increases and general increases in the cost of living. They have the same deflator that applies to most of the other departments. A substantial amount of the additional expenditure can be explained by that process.

         Secondly, a substantial proportion of the differences between the period of time that Mr Hayden has been in office and that of his predecessors goes to renovations of Government House. Those renovations are determined from time to time as required by an Official Establishments Trust which works out how to keep our old public buildings in decent operation. They are not a benefit to the Governor-General. They are not renovations of his private property; they are renovations of the property of the Australian people. Obviously, those renovations of old places like the Governor-General's residence and establishment are from time to time likely to be substantial and do explain most of the expenditure additional to that.

         There are one or two other items. I am advised that the Governor-General no longer utilises as personal aides members of the defence forces, so a slight increase in the civilian establishment has been associated with that. Other expenditures that were drawn to our attention by the article go to the utilisation of a 707 for a recent trip to the 80th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. That was an entirely appropriate occasion for the Governor-General to attend. That trip was accompanied by a swing through Indo-China, where he was, of course, representing Australian interests and concerns. Clearly, it was convenient for him, in those circumstances where it is difficult to travel in that region, to operate with an Australian government jet. The notion that he is, in some way or another, personally advantaged by taking a 707 as opposed to sitting in the front of a Qantas jet again draws a long bow. All of us here have been in the government 707s from time to time.

The fact is that nobody could conceivably say that the front end of a Qantas jet is not better than travelling in the 707s. I only make the point in passing. It was an appropriate use of that aircraft by the Governor-General. When you take all those factors into consideration, the additional costs being experienced by Government House are pretty well explicable.

Yesterday, an organisation representing young Australians outlined to the minister a number of proposals and issues regarding youth unemployment. Can the minister indicate to the House whether it is the intention of the government to take into account their views and those of others in the community in developing further responses to that significant problem?

         In the discussions that I had with the youth group, a number of issues came up. Of major concern to the group that visited yesterday was the question of what would happen to youth wages. Under us, they do not have a problem because we are committed to no cuts to youth wages. We do have a training wage, but it is award and competency based and it must lead to an accredited outcome. If training is not undertaken, then  the appropriate award needs to apply, and this government is well known for its support of wage increases. Their concern, however, is with what they think the coalition stands for. Yesterday they made the following demand of the coalition:

        This was issued the day before the Leader of the Opposition attended the ACOSS conference. He had the opportunity to set the record straight, but he did not. He squibbed it. It is true that what he did was to rule out a $3 per hour minimum rate, which was such a disastrous policy for you at the last election. But what we do know is that the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow spokesman are committed to reintroducing Jobsback. The Leader of the Opposition said in November last year:

        So the substance of Jobsback is still the coalition policy. Let me just remind the House of what the substance of Jobsback means for wages. They are committed to reintroducing Austrain. Austrain is something the shadow spokesman has spoken with praise about. But what does Austrain involve? If people have been out of work for six months, their wages will be cut by 10 per cent. If they have been out of work for 12 months, they will be cut by 20 per cent. If they have been out of work for 18 months, they will be cut by 25 per cent. Apart from cutting the rate, which is what Austrain would do, there is no requirement under Austrain to actually train the person or to give accreditation and recognition to training already undertaken.

         The opposition's position in relation to youth wages is shameless. They think that they have covered themselves because they have ruled out the $3 per hour minimum rate. But they have not ruled out $3.10 an hour or $3.20 an hour and they have not ruled out Austrain, which will see wages for youth cut. It is not what the opposition have said; it is what they will not say. The simple truth is that under John Howard youth wages will be cut.

         I think it is important to put on record the position in relation to youth unemployment. The number of teenagers looking for full-time work is at its lowest level since April 1990. In September it fell by almost 3,000 to 88,500. Over the year to September the number of teenagers looking for full-time work fell by 6,500.

         The full-time unemployment rate for teenagers fell from 28 per cent in August to 26.7 per cent in September. As a proportion of the total—note that: total—15- to 19-year-old population, teenage unemployment fell from 7.2 per cent to seven per cent. As acknowledged over the last few days by a number of commentators, rates of youth unemployment are confusing and misleading as to the state of the youth labour market. They are therefore inappropriate as the basis for a target.

         Clearly our aim is to reduce the number of 88,500 teenagers looking for full-time work, and we are clearly making headway. When we came back to power in 1983, do you know how many teenagers were out of work when John Howard left them? There were 158,000. Today it is 88,000—44 per cent lower. So don't give us this hypocrisy on your side of the House about doing something for the youth unemployed; it is nonsense.

         The reality is that, even though we have dropped the number by 44 per cent, the unemployment rate itself, as measured by the statistician, has remained pretty much the same. The reason for that is that the number of teenagers available for work has declined dramatically. We have seen many more stay on to complete year 12 and many more go into TAFE or into universities—all because this government has funded the capacity for them to do so and all because we recognise that the jobs that used to employ people in the 1970s and early 1980s, the unskilled jobs, do not exist anymore. If you do not recognise that, then you are not following where the labour market is going. As we progress further towards the Finn targets, we will see—

We have set our sails for getting five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 and ensuring, by the programs we have in place, that youth get their fair share. It is the opposition that has given up on a target. It is the Leader of the Opposition who last week said that five per cent was not achievable. That is the message he is giving to the young people in this country: `We've given up on you. And for those who are looking for jobs, we'll cut your wages at the same time.' That is the difference between us and you and that is why they will support us.

         —Of course, many people who are advocating the cutting of the sole parent pension draw a completely false analogy with the United States that fails to take account of all the active measures we have taken to ensure or to maximise the chances of sole parents getting back into the work force. The fact is that the teenage pregnancy rate has halved in this country since sole parent support was introduced in the 1970s, unlike in the United States where the rate of teenage pregnancy has increased quite substantially. So the suggestion that the existence of some sort of income support structure leads to a proliferation of teenage pregnancy is a demonstrably false proposition. Of course, the government has done a range of other things that the member for Mackellar and others have failed to acknowledge. One such thing is the introduction of the child support scheme as a result of which many more custodial parents, following family break-up, are now receiving some sort of support from the non-custodial parents.

If not, will the government take action as the majority shareholder to prevent the payment of $17 million in so-called `golden handcuffs' to senior management of AIDC on top of their salaries, especially since the justification for these payments—the sale of the government's remaining 80 per cent stake in AIDC—has been shelved and the government will in fact buy out the minority shareholders?

         If the AIDC is going to continue in the financial sector, it would be sensible for its board to pay levels of salary, emoluments and all the rest of it that are equivalent to what is received in the financial sector.

This is the government that is putting in place via the superannuation process a savings policy that addresses the decline in private savings in this country and guarantees a decent retirement for all Australians, particularly for our current young Australians.

To this end the government has indicated that we will intervene in these proceedings. The member for Capricornia and each of her government colleagues raised a number of serious concerns about AMH's approach to enterprise bargaining. For our part, the government will ask the commission to investigate the allegations of duress by AMH during the bargaining process, and claims that meat workers' pay is being reduced under arrangements pursued by AMH. These are very serious allegations and must be properly and fully investigated.

Is it not also a fact that, since September 1984, home loan affordability has reached the levels of the previous coalition government in only one quarter of the intervening 11 years?

         In the course of this last term of parliament, interest rates for home loans in this country have never gone above what was the lowest figure under John Howard's tutelage as the Treasurer of this nation. Home loan affordability in the sclerotic system they had was knocked to pieces by the fact  that it was almost impossible to lay your hands on any money in that highly regulated environment, unless you were prepared to put yourself way above what were the advertised and allegedly fixed rates. In comparing our position here with your position when you were in office, the situation of borrowers for home loans now is vastly better.

In the last year the coalition was in office, commencements were 34,794—less than half of today's figures. I have a graph that shows that. Here we are; there you were. I table the graph.

         One of the ways that this problem can be addressed is by agricultural scientists worldwide applying their talents and their science to increasing agricultural production to make it more efficient, more productive, and to make agricultural methods more sustainable. Australia does, as the member indicates, make a significant contribution in this field. Only this week, our scientific credentials in the agriculture field were given a further boost by the appointment of a sixth Australian scientist to lead a major international agricultural research centre. That is six out of only 22 worldwide, so we are really fighting very much above our weight in this area.

         The appointment of Dr Eric Craswell as the new Director-General of the International Board for Soil Research and Management, IBSRAM, means that in the last year three senior scientists from ACIAR, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, have been appointed to lead international research centres. Our contribution is not just significant; it is second to none. IBSRAM promotes soil management research in developing countries. In other words, it focuses on the welfare of the soil, which is the most fundamental resource for agriculture and the prime consideration in natural resource conservation.

         One of the reasons we can take pride in this is the increasing part played by the aid program which operates through ACIAR. It is not just a funding body for agricultural research. It puts together collaborative, cooperative teams of scientists from Australia and other countries to work together to solve problems, and that has given our scientists international experience which makes them highly valued in the research community. This would not happen if it were not for the supportive climate fostered by this government, and indeed supported by the opposition, through the aid program. As long as I am minister responsible for this, those opportunities will continue.

The third is also a particularly great Australian, but I remember that he booted me up the backside when he was on the training staff of the army officer training unit. He is a good friend. I am reminded of further complaints on Monday and Tuesday of this week of the very great difficulty people sitting in the gallery, especially towards the top of the gallery, are having in hearing words on quieter question time days, let alone on rowdier question time days. I am told that the acoustics, particularly in the back two rows, on the front section and the two side sections, are difficult. Mr Speaker, I am wondering whether you might look at this, because if people are good enough to come to the gallery they should at least be able to hear the proceedings from the floor of the House.

        To cut off access and deny the people their right of access to their elected federal member for assistance on important and urgent matters and other issues is outrageous and scandalous and should be stopped. Furthermore, the action of the minister, the member for Canning, in seemingly acquiescing in this virtual thuggery and saying `he did not tell his office staff what to do' is a frightening admission by a minister of the Crown. The concept that ordinary Australians, battlers, can be cut off from making contact with their member of parliament to seek redress and advice is outrageous and is a startling admission that a federal member of parliament's work is and can be impeded by a union.

         —This is a government that has become very long indeed on rhetoric about things like social justice, regional development, boosting exports, even retaining the family farm. We hear about how that is important for economic and social reasons now from none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But there is in fact a huge gulf between rhetoric and reality. As, in the broader context in Australia, the rich get richer and the poor become more numerous, the same is happening in rural Australia. Many of those more numerous poor are rural Australians, our wealth creators, those who provide the overwhelming base for our export performance, and those who, in these increasingly environmentally conscious times, ought to be seen and recognised as the custodians of our natural resource base.

         Yet, thanks to the government, thanks to that policy drift, their inertia, their reform fatigue, what we really see, despite the rhetoric, in rural and regional Australia is increasing dislocation, increasing poverty, increasing loss of job opportunities, and nowhere do we see these problems more evident than amongst young people in the country.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We see anecdotal and real evidence of young men leaving the bush in droves and young women leaving even faster. Tragically, it is often the most talented people with the most to offer for the future, the people who will be most needed in the future in rural Australia, who are leaving.

         My electorate is no exception. We have noted something of a contraction in the size of the work force in Gwydir since the recession set in over the last couple of years of some 4,500 people—many of them young people, many of them skilled, many of them people who will be needed when things turn around. This is despite the fact that two of Australia's wealthiest agricultural shires are in my electorate—Narrabri and Gunnedah. In the case of Moree, this is reflected in the town by the unbelievable number of vacant homes that are on the market—no purchaser available. In Gunnedah, a couple of hundred homes in what is not a very big town do not even have the power turned on any more.

         There has been an explosion of farm debt, but the government over the past 13 years has refused to do anything about arresting that decline in our rural fortunes. This has had a significant impact on job opportunities and returns for efforts made in rural Australia. We have seen farm debt go from $7 billion when this mob came to power to $17 1/2 billion today. Again, the young are unduly affected. They are giving up hope and questioning their role in the so-called lucky country.

         Today we heard some statistics from our spokesman in this area about the unemployment of youth; that is, those from 15 to 20 years old. The national youth unemployment rate is 28 per cent. That is a disgrace. Look at what is happening in country regions. I understand that in one district of the Mallee area the youth unemployment rate is about 66 per cent. Two-thirds of the young people in that area do not have a job. The Wide Bay-Burnett region has a youth unemployment rate of 41 1/2 per cent. The central west of New South Wales has a youth unemployment rate of 32 per cent. In central Queensland that figure is nearly 40 per cent.

         Those figures probably disguise the reality. It is probably worse in many of those areas but it is covered up by various programs which are designed to disguise the full extent of the real problem and to train people for jobs that tragically will often not be there. Why will they not be there? Because the government is severely inflicted with reform fatigue. Murdoch was spot on when he said that Australia's economy is a disgrace. Didn't he stir up a hornet's nest when he talked about youth unemployment? We saw a mad scramble from those opposite trying to discredit what he had to say. It is very interesting.

         The people in the bush are losing hope. There is a loss of belief by country people, our wealth creators, in their future just when the experts are now widely beginning to talk about a bright future. A little while ago, Graham Blight made reference here in Canberra to that fact. Graham Blight is well known and well respected in this place. He predicted that agriculture would be back at the forefront of governments' agendas in coming years for very good reason. He pointed to the fact that by the year 2025, when I will be 68—it is not so far away, in 30 years time—the world will need another 300 million tonnes of wheat a year just to feed itself, another 260 million tonnes of corn, another 210 million tonnes of rice and another 16 million tonnes of fish. Imagine the fibre that we will need to clothe people and the material that we will need to put roofs over our heads globally. Let us put all that into perspective: the biggest crop that Australia, as the world's second biggest exporter of wheat, ever grew was just 22 million tonnes in 1982-83. We will have to find another 300 million tonnes in 30 years time.

There is no consultation with the people at the coalface, the people who actually have stewardship over the environment. They just say, `Here's what you'll do. Here's how you'll do it.

         Then we come to forestry. What an absolute debacle, what an absolute mess, we have seen from those opposite. Investment is drying up, and there is one indication of that. We hear all their talk about growing a bigger timber and paper products industry. Whilst they talk about it here, it actually happens in New Zealand. They will establish 100,000 hectares of softwood plantation this year. In Australia it is estimated that 8,000 hectares will be established. Some 100,000 hectares will be established there while 8,000 hectares will be established here.

We are shutting the thing down to the huge disadvantage—again, let me emphasise this—not just of country people and young people in the bush but of the nation's economic performance. In case you had not noticed—and here is one of the ministers who is very good on spending money—we have to generate wealth in this country if we are to then distribute it. And here we are again undermining the people who need to be encouraged to invest, to employ people and to produce a bigger cake so that there is more to go around for everyone.

         I now turn to the issue of competitiveness. The tyranny of distance is a great problem. I have to touch on this. I cannot resist it as my opposite number over there keeps talking about how he has reformed Australia's waterfront. A recent study was carried out of 46 ports around the world. Although we have spent $400 million since 1989, the beginning of the government's reform program, what has actually happened? Sydney has slipped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has gone from 28th to 37th in terms of world competitiveness. Did you hear the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) guffaw when I accused the government of having reform fatigue? Did you hear it? It is wonderful, isn't it?

         I cannot help but mention something we ought to be very proud of in this country: we are the world's No. 1 exporter of beef product. But you know what? Such is your reform fatigue that we are no longer competitive at home. The first rule of being an effective trading nation in any given commodity is to make sure that you are competitive at home. But what do we find in the case of the beef industry? We are not competitive at home. So how are we ever going to make it? We have got American and New Zealand product on our shelves. How are we ever going to make it in the important Asian markets to our north if we cannot do our best here?

         The fact of the matter is that the industry is on its knees at the moment and, with it, the wellbeing of thousands of producers. And here is the rub for you blokes: so are tens of thousands of Australian workers. We have had report after report and study after study which have clearly indicated that we are grossly underperforming to such an extent that the only reason we are competitive on world markets at all is that our beef producers receive as little as half of what their opposite numbers in New Zealand and America get. For years the government has ignored time and again the problem—although the government did decide a couple of years ago that they would have their own industry commission look at this whole issue again.

         What the commission had to say was really very interesting. The first thing it said was that we are competitive only because of the low prices paid to Australian producers. It went on to say a few other things that members opposite might be interested in. One is that change has been painfully slow and that greater industrial relations flexibility and productivity are the key to the industry's future. But here is the bit that is really interesting:
        </tab>

        The Commission has found that greater flexibility, particularly greater use of enterprise agreements, could bring about significant productivity gains with benefits for . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Who would you expect would get the benefits? Farmers? The nation? Do you know who the commission nominated first? The workers of this country. The first who would benefit are the workers—then the producers, the processors and, after that, some consumers, as the commission put it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is reported in another place that, if we could pick up the hundreds of billions of dollars that are out there to be gained by some improved performance, the benefit to workers would be about 25 per cent of that better return. What did the government do with all this? It sat on it for 14 months. There were 23 major recommendations, and the government picked up one, basically.

         After 14 months the government introduced some legislation into the second chamber in this place. This is Australia's major agricultural export industry, except when wool overtakes it occasionally. How importantly did the government regard the reform process? Perhaps it is reflected in the fact they picked up just one of 23 recommendations and introduced it on a day when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) was not even in Australia. It was appropriate that he was in America on that day. That is fine, but the government had 14 months in which to choose a day when the minister would be here to introduce it. But, no, they did not, and so it goes on and on.

         When we raised enterprise bargaining with them, which they claimed had basically been put in place in the industry—you heard it again from the minister here—he said, `That's fixed it all up. We don't need to address the other areas here.' And it just so happened that on that day something had fallen off the back of a truck: an independent report on the Department of Primary Industries and Energy which said:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        and this is a matter of only weeks old even now—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        with some exceptions, progress has generally been limited, with little to show in terms of widespread and quantifiable increases in productivity and efficiency. The [general nature of] enterprise bargains achieved to date have not been particularly innovative or successful in encouraging improvements . . . In many cases, they have been little more than a means to achieve a general wage increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        So there you go—abysmal failure in one of Australia's most important regional industries and most important export industries. Confronted with the evidence from his independent report, Senator Collins over in the other place—and this is very interesting; this is just two weeks ago—went on to say:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        in cooperation with the unions and under the supervision of the Industry Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think he meant the Industrial Relations Commission. That is really very interesting. For years and years they can ignore the reform process at the cost of workers, at the cost of the industry and at the possible demise now of the industry; but in the space of two weeks they can act when a complaint comes in from the other side. I reckon that is an enormous vote of no confidence in your system in general and an enormous vote of no confidence in the commission in particular, because they were meant to be overseeing this. In short, the whole process is nothing short of a national disgrace.

         —Since I have been a minister in this government every MPI from the opposition I have debated has been based on a false premise. Today's MPI is no exception.

         The MPI refers to the question of job security. It is the case that this country has had one of the most rapid rates of job growth in the entire OECD over a period of several years. In the year to the three months to July—in other words, the most recent quarter for which statistics are available from the Department of Employment, Education and Training—employment growth in Australia as a whole was 4.4 per cent. This represented 347,000 new jobs in Australia as a whole.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The implication of the MPI is that rural and regional Australia has missed out on its fair share of that employment growth. What are the facts? The facts are that employment growth in non-metropolitan Australia was much stronger than the average. In fact, in the non-metropolitan area employment growth totalled no less than 6.2 per cent over that period, which is almost twice as great as the 3.4 per cent job growth recorded in metropolitan Australia. That is the first point: rural and regional Australia have shared very substantially in the exceptionally strong job growth that has gone on.

         Of the 347,000 jobs created in Australia in the course of that year, 170,000 of them—that is, almost half—were in non-metropolitan areas. Indeed in all states, except Victoria and Western Australia—and it is interesting to note that the opposition spokesman and Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), somehow tried to blame Labor state governments for the poor performance—more than 50 per cent of the job growth was outside the capital city.

         Furthermore, this is not a short-term trend. It is a trend that has been occurring throughout our term of office. It is true that there is considerable variation in unemployment across regional Australia, just as there is considerable variation in unemployment across metropolitan Australia. The Deputy Leader of the National Party's own region, which is north and central west New South Wales, has a rate of 6.6 per cent, which is well below the national average of more than eight per cent. In the Murray-Murrumbidgee area of New South Wales unemployment was as low as 4.4 per cent. The highest level of unemployment in Australia is not in non-metropolitan Australia, it is in western Melbourne.

         Of course what matters about unemployment is the policies to reduce it. We are reducing unemployment. Unemployment has fallen in almost all the regions of non-metropolitan Australia. We gave the economy a fiscal kick-start, which the opposition opposed, from the recession. We are maintaining an accord which has provided a framework that has facilitated strong employment growth. The opposition has opposed that. We have introduced the job compact to provide a fundamental structural change in the labour market in favour of job growth, and particularly job growth opportunities for the disadvantaged in the labour market.

         The fact is that the MPI today is from the political party that believes people who live in regional Australia are not part of a broader Australian nation. The National Party has always pretended that somehow regional Australians do not have the same interests as other Australians, which is a nonsense. Moreover, the National Party has always believed that the only people of worth in regional Australia are primary producers and other small business operators. They want to pretend that the indigenous population does not exist, that the social security recipients in regional Australia do not exist and that wage and salary earners in regional Australia do not exist.

There has been a fall in real household incomes in 70 per cent of neighbourhoods and a real increase in income in only 30 per cent of neighbourhoods in Australia. The minister has the hide to say that things are better. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says that things will never get better than they are at the moment. Put in plain English, recent research indicates that average household incomes in the bottom five per cent of neighbourhoods have fallen by more than $7,500 in real terms, while the top five per cent of neighbourhoods have increased their incomes by more than $12,000 on average.

         The Minister for Social Security claimed that the federal social wage is $1,774 for every Australian and that this has increased by more than $700 since 1983. This figure is arrived at by adding all federal spending on health, education, housing and child care and dividing that by the number in the population. Again, this is another clever play with figures.

         It is obvious that, with the increase in the Australian population, the minister is misleading the Australian people. The simple fact of the matter is that this so-called federal social wage is not benefiting the people whom the government claims it is benefiting. It is also obvious that 40 per cent of the lowest income earners receive only 35 per cent of the social wage, while 40 per cent of the highest income earners receive 46 per cent of the social wage.

         So we have a situation where the government has endeavoured to confuse the Australian people yet again. Don Russell, the current Australian Ambassador to the United States, has said that he wants to come back here to ensure we do not create in Australia the kind of underclass they currently have in the United States. Everyone agrees that the ambassador's comments are totally out of order for a diplomatic representative of Australia, but the simple fact of the matter is that we already have the working poor in Australia.

I forget the exact figures, but the spokesman said that the industry now has less than half the number of producers, yet they are producing five or 10 per cent more dairy products.

How much money per annum is being spent on these Landcare groups, which are supported by primary producers throughout Australia? It is $150 million.

He talked about household disposal income. Let me make it very clear for all to understand: full-time adult average weekly earnings have increased by 7.2 per cent between June 1983 and June 1995; real household disposal income has increased over that same period by 41.8 per cent; and real household disposal income per capita has increased by 20.9 per cent, almost 21 per cent.

         The previous speaker, the member for Fisher, talked about the social wage. Let's make it very clear: the social wage includes expenditure on health, education, housing and child care. Under a coalition government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was Treasurer, between 1970-78 and 1982-83 the change in the real value of the Commonwealth social wage per person was a reduction of 17.5 per cent. That is, there was a 17.5 per cent fall in the social wage under the previous coalition government.

         Since Labor has been in power, since 1982-83, the social wage has gone up by 73 per cent.

         I make the point that the National Party and, indeed, the Liberal Party purport to represent the interests of business. One other area which has been reformed under Labor is the tax system. Let us just have a look at a couple of figures which demonstrate yet again why Australians, wherever they are—rural, regional or metropolitan Australia—are measurably better off under Labor than they have ever been, certainly a lot better off than they were under the previous coalition government, and a lot better off than they will ever be under a government administered by the opposition.

         One interesting figure is the amount of money the government spends for its own purposes. Government revenue as a proportion of GDP under the Howard government in 1982-83 was 26 per cent. Under the current government that figure is 25.3 per cent. We are spending less of our income as a proportion of GDP. Government outlays as a percentage of GDP when Mr Howard was the Treasurer were 28.6 per cent. Under this government, this year, they are 25.1 per cent. That is just another example.

         One of the interesting issues in relation to the ability of business to get on, to do its job and be competitive, and to families surviving, is income tax. What is the comparison between the rate of income tax under the opposition when it was in power and the rate of income tax now being experienced by Australians wherever they might live? Top marginal tax rates under Mr Howard were 60 per cent. They are now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal tax rate under Mr Howard was 30 per cent. It is now 20 per cent. The company tax rate under Mr Howard was 46 per cent. Under this government it is 36 per cent.

         This government, despite the minister's disclaimers in his speech, has winked for a long time at the indisputable fact that Australian undergraduates are being charged up-front fees through the back door. Australian undergraduates are paying for courses not for credit, and when they pass those courses are being credited for them. It is a way of enabling them to get into the system. The government claims that it is unable to establish the validity of these claims. If that is so, then its information sources about the higher education system are very poor.

If the government does that and decides that it will cut places out of the system, that will not be a result of the decisions of the coalition. It will not be a result of the decisions of the Senate. It will flow directly from the government's own priorities.

This is contemptible. It will be noted by students around Australia and I have no doubt that it will be resolutely and absolutely rejected by them.

         —I am glad there are so many members of the government in here to hear me speak about taxation. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which was introduced in this place on 29 June of this year, makes a range of amendments including changes affecting foreign controlled companies; changes affecting dividends paid out of capital accounts, which were announced in this year's budget; extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002; a number of changes to the collection of tax; reducing the twice monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million as announced in this year's budget; increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebate to 36 per cent in line with the company tax rate; and changes to the superannuation guarantee system allowing employees to elect that employers do not make superannuation guarantee contributions and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate superannuation contributions.

         There are three aspects of this bill in particular which I wish to address today. The first one relates to the part of the bill dealing with foreign income and in particular with tainted income. The Australian controllers of a controlled foreign company are not taxed on that part of the controlled foreign company's tainted income—that is, income including passive and certain other business income which is less than five per cent of its total income which passes the active income test. The commissioner may make adjustments reflecting arms-length values when determining a controlled foreign company's attributable income but it has not been clear whether the adjustment affects the active income test. A lack of power to make adjustment to amounts used in determining the active income test may result in a CFC satisfying the test where it should have failed.

         This bill seeks to clarify that where CFCs have entered non-arms-length transactions with related parties the commissioner is allowed to make adjustments reflecting arms-length values to determine whether a CFC has passed the active income test. Aspects of this particular part of the bill have been raised with the opposition, in particular by the Corporate Tax Association. We are aware from comments made through the Corporate Tax Association that there is more than one company group adversely affected and the legislation would have produced inequitable tax consequences if it had been enacted in the form of the bill.

         Of particular concern is the aspect that the application of the amendment incorporated in the bill is to apply for statutory accounting periods ending after 30 June 1995. For a CFC with a statutory accounting period ending after that date, the amendment is therefore applicable as from the beginning of that particular statutory accounting period and therefore has retrospective application. I understand an amendment will be moved in relation to that matter and the opposition will be supporting that particular amendment.

         The second aspect of the bill that I wish to turn to relates to dividends paid out of capital accounts. The current position is that all dividends received by resident public companies from resident companies and franked or grouped company dividends received by resident private companies from resident companies are free from tax as a result of the intercorporate dividend rebate. Certain distributions debited to a company's share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are characterised as dividends. The result is that these distributions qualify for the rebate and effectively give tax redistributions to corporate shareholders and pass on franking credits to shareholders ordinarily unable to access them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The bill disqualifies dividends that are debited or paid from amounts transferred from, first, share capital accounts, secondly, share premium accounts or, thirdly, asset revaluation reserves from being rebatable or frankable dividends. Share premium accounts include share premium accounts tainted by the inclusion of amounts other than share premiums or amounts which cannot be identified as share premiums in the company's books and which do not therefore satisfy the section 6 definition of `share premium account'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As a consequence of the introduction of the new measures, most of the rebatable dividend adjustment provisions in the legislation have become redundant and are being repealed. The amendments will apply to dividends paid after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995 unless they were declared prior to that time. Dividends from amounts transferred before 9 May from a share capital or share premium account or asset revaluation reserve are not subject to the amendments nor are dividends paid under certain transitional arrangements.

         These measures may have, we believe, some unintended consequences and the Insurance Council, in particular, has argued that the legislation could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from the ordinary retained earnings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business.

         I understand that the government is proposing certain amendments in relation to this provision in particular. What the Insurance Council pointed out is that there is a serious technical deficiency in the current drafting of part of the bill in so far as it relates to rebatable and frankable dividends. The council believes that the legislation, as currently drafted prior to any amendment by the government, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnings where movements occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves as part of their ordinary business activity.

I will not take the time of the House to go into the technical detail that has been raised by the Insurance Council of Australia, as I understand this is the subject of the amendments which will be moved in the committee stage on behalf of the government.

         The third area which I wish to address in relation to this somewhat technical legislation relates to the notional earnings base of the superannuation guarantee charge. Currently, employers can use their pre-21 August 1991 employee earnings base if they continue to contribute to the same fund and under the same law award arrangement or schemes as for an employee for whom they were contributing immediately before 21 August 1991. If they restructure, they generally will have to contribute under the ordinary time earnings base.

         The bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to extend the use of pre-21 August 1991 employee earnings bases if employers restructure their superannuation funds. An employer will be allowed to keep pre-21 August 1991 earnings bases if the employer contributes under the same law award arrangement or scheme to, first, a new fund under the same earnings base as the original fund if employees transfer between the funds and receive substantially the same or improved rights to benefits; secondly, an existing fund in relation to an employee of a former employer who transfers to the fund from the former employer's fund because of a business acquisition if the base was used in the former employer's fund; or, thirdly, a former employers fund for employees who transfer to the new employer because of a business acquisition.

         The amendments affect the calculation of the superannuation guarantee charge from 1 July 1995 where qualifying restructures occur after 28 June 1994. The effect is that employers reorganising funds after the announcement need not lose an existing employee earnings base for contributions made for contribution periods after 1 July 1995. Employers who restructured after the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 28 June 1994, which was when this measure was announced, but before 1 July 1995 will have changed to the ordinary time earnings base from the time of restructure. On 1 July 1995 they will be able to revert to the pre-21 August 1991 earnings base to which they previously contributed. The amendment affects an employer's contributions only from 1 July 1995 so that contributions already made by employers during 1994-95 and contributions due for that year will not be reduced.

         The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has raised a particular concern in relation to the notional earnings base. ASFA believes that the changes should be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and should cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions irrespective of the date of those reconstructions.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The problem which ASFA points to refers to the definition of earnings base in the superannuation guarantee legislation in circumstances where there has been a reconstruction. Paragraph 3.3 of the Treasurer's discussion paper, issued on 4 December 1991, stated that the earnings base for superannuation guarantee contributions would be that set out in the governing rules of the scheme or in an award, provided that, firstly, the scheme was in existence on 20 August 1991 or, secondly, the scheme was not in existence on 20 August 1991 but is a successor to a scheme that was in existence on 20 August 1991 and the earnings base used is no narrower than that used by the original scheme.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         When the superannuation guarantee legislation was enacted in 1992 no provision was made for these successor funds circumstances. The current bill seeks to address this situation, but only from 1 January 1995. I should indicate that in their representations ASFA is not seeking the retrospective operation of the amendments in order to allow employers to claim refunds from funds. If considered necessary, a provision to prescribe such claims could be included in the legislation.

         My question in relation to this particular matter—the notional earnings base as it relates to the superannuation guarantee charge—is one which has been effectively raised: why shouldn't the changes be effective from the commencement of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act and cover all employer and/or fund reconstructions, irrespective of the date of those reconstructions? I hope that when the Treasurer or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) come to speak again in this particular debate they could give some indication to the House and to the coalition regarding that particular matter because it does seem to be an anomaly in the way in which the provisions of this bill have been drafted.

         Apart from those matters, there are a number of other technical and mechanical aspects of this bill which I will not detain the time of the House this evening by going into in great detail, but those three matters are matters on which the opposition, whilst it does not oppose the legislation, would seek some clarification. In relation to the first matter that I mentioned, we will be supporting an amendment to change the actual date which is set out in the bill itself.

         —I am pleased to support the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. I was wondering whether, given that the previous speaker was the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), an amendment had been moved to bring back the GST. I guess we will have to wait and find out when we take the vote. This bill covers quite a number of areas of taxation issues. It covers issues such as foreign income, rebatable and frankable dividends, bankruptcy and losses, reduction of PAYE early remittance threshold, group certificates and other PAYE provisions and superannuation guarantee matters.

         One of the things that I have come to learn in the time I have been here is how complex and big our tax act is. It covers some 5,000 pages at last count. In my first few months here, after I was appointed to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, at the tail end of the taxation inquiry, I learnt that the taxation law was very complex. People around the room in that PAC inquiry all agreed that something had to be done. I know now that there is a lot of work being done in the Australian Taxation Office on simplifying the tax act. In the meantime, we have to deal with the current situation and we have a number of these amendments which seem to come before the House and the Senate every year.

         The taxation law is a bit like social security  provisions—the more you get into it and the more you look at different provisions, the more complex it seems. It does not matter what governments try to do, there always seems to be a complication and anomaly that can throw up an injustice, like something that will affect somebody differently from somebody else. We never seem to be able to get the balance quite right in terms of fairness and equity on the one hand and simplicity on the other hand without affecting somebody somewhere along the line. I know that there is a lot of work going on and there is a project called the taxation law improvement project under way at the moment.

         I guess it was partly because of the desire for simplicity—at least that was one of the attractions—that the opposition decided to promote a consumption tax, a goods and services tax, before the last election. One of the arguments in favour of the consumption tax was that it was simpler and everyone would pay the same amount of 15 per cent on all goods and services, except food. That was supposed to be simpler and therefore easier to collect. That was one of the great attractions put forward for it.

         Even though I do not agree with a consumption tax and never have, there are a lot of people, including some in the tax office, who argue quite genuinely that they believe that that is an attraction of a consumption tax and that we will eventually have one. I hope we never do because I believe it is an inequitable tax and a regressive tax. I do know that some of my friends and people in the community genuinely believe that, because of this supposed simplicity and equality—although it is not really, of course—with everyone paying the same flat right of consumption tax, it is therefore simpler and more easy to administer and harder to avoid. I do not happen to believe that.

         I have already said that there is a need for simplification, but tax is also a very emotional issue. Unfortunately, in this country it seems to be fashionable to talk about reducing tax. We are, as we quite often hear, the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. We were the lowest taxed country; I believe Turkey is now apparently lower taxed than we are, because of some fiddling of the figures or whatever. So now we are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. Unfortunately, some people in the government seem to think that is a badge of honour and we should boast about that. I believe that it is a bit of a problem and people in the community are increasingly seeing it, if they are honest, as a problem because the revenue is important.

         People do expect a certain level of service and quality of services from governments at all levels. If we are going to have that service, people do have to face up to the situation that people have to pay tax and the revenue has to be there. It has to be fair and equitable, of course. But to suggest that we pay too much tax, as a lot of people do, particularly on the other side of the House and in the business community, et cetera, is not only dishonest but unfair and damaging to the Australian economy and the fabric of society.

         Unfortunately, because of the `greed is good' mentality, particularly of the opposition, we have this situation where expectations are raised. Any suggestion that we pay more tax or that individuals pay more tax is treated with horror and we have all sorts of people running for cover, saying, `We are a lower taxing party than you are,' et cetera. I believe that is an undesirable feature of current Australian politics. We really do need to face up to the fact that people have to pay tax and they should pay the tax that is due. That does not mean that ordinary workers—PAYE taxpayers—should necessarily pay more tax.

         One of the biggest problems is compliance and the avoidance industry, where companies or people on better incomes are able to minimise tax through all sorts of clever accountants and tax minimisation schemes. Of course, one obvious one that I have come across in the last few weeks is the move away from PAYE towards the PPS scheme. We have a number of examples, particularly in the construction industry, where workers are forming themselves into companies or becoming contractors and, therefore, somehow or other qualifying to be PPS taxpayers rather than PAYE taxpayers. That is totally against the spirit of taxation laws, and I understand that that is being looked at by the tax office.

         It cannot come too soon as far as I am concerned. Not only is this an organised attempt to supposedly bring more flexibility into industrial relations, thereby basically smashing industrial relations and smashing trade unionism by everyone becoming a contractor—which would suit the opposition's industrial relations policies perfectly—but also this is potentially eroding the revenue in a big way. That is one area that I will certainly be keeping an eye on in terms of tax policy to make sure that that does not continue and that people do as they are supposed to do—pay the tax that they are obliged to pay under the PAYE system, whether or not they want to call themselves contractors or subcontractors.

I should not admit that, should I? I have only about two weeks to go. The ordinary battlers, the PAYE taxpayers who earn an ordinary income, fill in their tax forms and they might get a small refund—somewhere between $100 or up to $1,000 a year, if they are lucky. It seems to me that the tax system is administered in a rather expensive way.

         A good idea might be to bring about, on a properly costed basis, a situation where ordinary taxpayers who earn only wages—who do not have other complications which preclude them from filling in a Form S, for example—be given the option of not bothering with a taxation return. By perhaps ticking a box at the beginning of the year on, say, their employment declaration certificate, they might opt out of the taxation system, in the sense that they would not have to bother with a taxation return, and in return they might get $500 or $1,000, whatever is a reasonable rate. I have not costed this, so I do not know.

         That would probably save the Taxation Office a lot of money. It would save a lot of paper. It would not cost ordinary taxpayers.

But, if they are just average taxpayers who might get a few hundred dollars a year, they could opt out of the system and get more in their pay packets, which would add up to the same amount—an averaged out amount every year—and they would not have to bother with the form.

         We do not necessarily need to raise tax levels in this country, if only we could get everyone to pay the tax that they should be paying. That has been the major problem. It was exemplified in the late 1970s when the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), was Treasurer. We had the famous bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, and a lot of pressure was put on the then government to do something about that when it became public knowledge.

I lived in Western Australia in the 1970s, and I can recall the Liberal Party slogans and stickers that used to be put up at election times by the Liberal Party that `taxation is theft'. Obviously, the people who run the Liberal Party in Western Australia, the ones who have got the numbers over there, do not think that anyone should pay tax or that it should be voluntary rather than a responsibility.

         What has made it difficult is this `greed is good' mentality. The same thing happens in other countries.

I agree that at election times people do get a bit carried away with promises and expectations. But what has made it very difficult in this climate which has been created, particularly on the other side of the House, is the suggestion made to people—and suggesting it often enough so that people believe it—that as a community we are somehow paying too much tax.

         —The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) was introduced into the House on 29 June this year. It makes nine substantive amendments to our tax laws. The provisions set out to amend several principal acts, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and Bankruptcy Act 1966. The changes in the bill include those affecting controlled foreign companies; dividends paid out of capital accounts, as announced in the 1995 budget; and extending the accelerated depreciation of ships to 30 June 2002.

         Further, changes are proposed to the method of collecting tax, reducing the price monthly remitter threshold from $5 million to $1 million, as announced in the budget, and increasing the infrastructure borrowings rebate to 36 per cent in line with the company tax rate. There are also changes to the super guarantee charge system in regard to allowing employees to elect that members not make SGC contributions under certain circumstances and by allowing the notional earnings base to be used to calculate SGC contributions.

         As to rebatable and frankable dividends, this bill proposes to amend the income tax laws so that dividends that are debited to share capital, premium accounts or revaluation reserves of a company are disqualified from being rebatable or frankable. The reason the government is taking this kind of action is apparently to stop companies providing tax free distributions to corporate shareholders or transferring franking credits to shareholders by inappropriate means. This particular measure is therefore aimed at limiting any potential tax avoidance.

         The only problem is that there is ample evidence that the government is yet again trying to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. There are unintended consequences of the proposal before us which impact on ordinary commercial transactions that are totally lawful. The Insurance Council has had this to say:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        We believe that the legislation, as currently drafted, could have the effect of preventing Australian companies from franking dividends paid from ordinary retained earnings, where movements have occurred to and from the company's asset revaluation reserves, as part of their ordinary business.

       <para>
        The council went on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The impact of this legislation, if enacted, could be disastrous for many Australian companies, and the anomaly is clearly something that was never intended at the time the proposals were announced in the federal budget . . . Because the effect of the provisions is to deny a company the ability to frank its dividends, the impact of the deficiency—

        that is, I think, the deficiency in the bill's wording—

       </para>
       <para>
        The Insurance Council has provided an example to illustrate this anomaly. Where a company owns a building at 30 June 1994 which cost, say, $100,000 to purchase but is now valued at $150,000, the amount to be credited to the revaluation reserve is quite obviously $50,000. There is also a corresponding debit to the asset account. However, by 30 June 1995, where the value of the building has fallen to $100,000 the company will debit the asset revaluation reserve and credit the asset account with the amount of $50,000. This entails a transfer of an amount from a `disqualifying account', the asset revaluation reserve account, to a `non-disqualifying account', the asset account.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Under section 461 of this bill, as part of the write-down, the company will credit the $50,000 I have mentioned in the example to the notional disqualifying account. If no other events occur, and the company pays a dividend of, say, $200,000 in July 1995, with the full amount being debited to its retained earnings, section 46G(1), as currently drafted, will provide that $50,000 of the dividend so paid will not be rebatable and will not be capable of being franked. Mr John Hodgkinson of the Insurance Council, in describing that particular situation, has said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        This situation will not be unusual and is likely to impact on many companies who have amounts moving into and out of asset revaluation reserves, for perfectly legitimate commercial reasons, e.g. complying with accounting standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        He has also made the observation that there is nothing to connect the asset revaluation reserve movements with the payment of a dividend. It is totally ridiculous for a company to be placed in the position of paying a dividend in a proper manner but then finding that dividend cannot be franked or rebated to recipient shareholders.

         The unintended consequences of this bill should be addressed. I have been informed that the government has prepared some amendments—and they came to hand late this morning—to address the concerns of the Tax Institute and the Insurance Council. I got them this morning at a quarter past nine. The bill was scheduled to be debated at 10 o'clock. I did not have an explanatory memorandum for those amendments, which go to 2 1/4 pages. Again, this is an example of the disdain with which the parliament is treated when it considers complex legislation.

        Without wanting to go into great depth now, because I will do so later in the detailed stages, the problem here is that this amendment will be applied retrospectively for the accounting periods commencing before but ending after June 1995. Therefore this measure is applicable from 1 July 1995 and as a consequence it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs where their financial year does not conveniently end on 30 June 1995. That is not uncommon, although it is not right either. That is most inequitable.

         I have constantly made the point that retrospectivity as a rule should be avoided in any legislation and in particular in tax legislation. Retrospectivity is only acceptable to me when it does not create losers but, even then, it should still be avoided. Retrospective tax legislation by this Labor government is far from unusual, as I am sure the House is aware. It has been a tool of Labor and it has not hesitated to use it. However, it is clear that such retrospectivity undermines certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system.

         With the constant stream of tax amendment bills coming before this place, as well as the draft rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it is obvious that the taxpaying community does not need the added uncertainty of retrospective tax changes. There must be community confidence in the certainty of the law—certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively.

         With tax law, taxpayers need to be able to determine their obligations with at least a modicum of certainty. But with retrospective tax legislation not only must taxpayers assess their tax position according to current law but also they need to determine what the intent of the relevant law was at the time it was drafted and passed through the parliament. That is necessary because one day the legislation will be retrospectively amended along certain lines.

         The problem is that we expect too much from taxpayers and accountants. How can taxpayers be expected to pre-empt what was the real intent of the law with their scarce resources, when parliament and its supporting bureaucracy couldn't get it right in the first place? The parliament, and especially the government, should be accountable for their errors, not taxpayers. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice and a repudiation of fairness where it occurs in our tax system. Not only is the tax system almost unintelligible, compliance costs exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime, but also with retrospectivity there is a serious element of guesswork, in trying to get an understanding of tax law. Stability and certainty in the tax system are key concepts this government simply has not been able to grasp.

         This bill comes before the House just over 10 years since the government announced its reform of the Australian tax system—otherwise aptly known as RATS. This announcement followed the much heralded 1985 tax summit, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, where the much supported option C of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was rejected by Bob Hawke in a deal with the ACTU heavies. RATS was supposed to provide a tax system which is simpler, fairer, does not increase the overall tax burden, does not disadvantage welfare recipients, moderates wage pressures, does not stifle investment, growth and jobs, and has widespread community support.

         Key aspects of Labor's changes included the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and dividend imputation. Labor might postulate that it has succeeded in meeting its objectives, and quite often it does. However, the reality is they have failed dismally. The overall tax burden has increased. Taken as a percentage of gross domestic product, public sector revenues have increased from 33.4 per cent to 34.4 per cent. Of this, the federal component appears to have fallen, but only because grants to the states have been slashed. Then, of course, when compulsory superannuation is added—because, let us face it, it is a tax on earnings—the overall tax burden has increased. Mr George Megalogenis put it accurately in the

        How is that? Australians are now also paying more in indirect taxes than they would have under the coalition's goods and services tax plan. Well, we know Labor always rants about the reduction of the top marginal rate from 60 per cent to 49 per cent, yet Labor still collects more income tax in real terms than the Fraser government ever did. Why is that? Bracket creep is the answer, as it always has been. Many middle income earners are now in the highest tax bracket.

         Anti-tax avoidance and evasion measures have been taken to ludicrous degrees, when the most simple method of limiting avoidance is, and always was, a goods and services tax. A goods and services tax would force many tax dodgers to start declaring their real level of income, thereby allowing the government to get off the back of honest taxpayers. Labor's tax system is definitely not simpler, and it is in no way fairer. Shifting huge wads of the cost of compliance on to employers may be electorally clever but economically it is disastrous. As a partial consequence, the objective of not stifling investment, growth and jobs has been a farcical failure.

As for limiting the negatives for welfare recipients, as claimed a little over 10 years ago by the present Prime Minister, a GST or retail sales tax can be introduced, with welfare recipients receiving compensation, of course. However, the introduction of a GST would be a bonus to those on welfare because it would better provide an environment for them to get out of the welfare poverty trap in so many cases.

         When I spoke on an FBT cost of compliance bill a couple of sitting weeks ago, I began my remarks by saying it is hard to imagine anything more depressing than a tax bill. I can think of other depressing things around this parliament, such as the salad bar in the members' dining room and the answers that we are sometimes forced to listen to at question time from some of the more narcotically boring members of the government front bench. There are certainly many other equally maudlin prospects but a tax bill is probably about the worst.

         Our tax system is embodied in the monstrous Income Tax Assessment Act, the first volume of which I have with me this afternoon. It is really now not so much a matter of a grimace of horror but a matter of black humour. It has become so complex and so far beyond the comprehension of ordinary Australians, be they individuals striving to earn an income in some field or workers for a large corporation, that resort to expensive and certainly very well qualified advisers is really the only answer these days if you have a problem with the tax office. I believe it is really so complex that perhaps we could say that the tax act itself is one of the chief causes of this country's economic woes.

         The attitude of the tax office towards this complexity is quite clear: they love it. There is nothing a tax bureaucrat likes more than a good dose of complexity. This was revealed in a startlingly topical article in this morning's
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         , which contained some comments made by a senior Treasury official, the head of the federal Treasury's tax policy division. He may not be from the Australian Taxation Office, but he certainly fits the description of a tax bureaucrat. Mr Ken Henry, in defending the complexity of the tax legislation, said, `Well, that was what was needed to deal with a complex world.' They have no sympathy whatsoever for the ordinary citizen who suffers the burden of this act and the general taxation scheme—whether it be income tax, fringe benefits tax or sales tax. I believe that the complexity of the scheme keeps those bureaucrats safe in their positions of power and authority.

         If Mr Henry said `bad luck' when people complained to him about the complexity of the act, then it is quite clear that there is no sign of a move towards a simpler system under this government. There does not even seem to be any sympathy for the prospect of a simpler system. When we debated the Taxation Laws Amendment (FBT Cost of Compliance) Bill last month, I pointed out that, in seeking to reduce the cost of compliance and the burden on the public, we are actually adding another 60 pages to the legislation. That legislation was 342 pages long when I was born in 1961. It now exceeds 5,000 pages. Enough said about that.

         I refer back to Mr Henry's comment that, as life is complex, we have to have a complex tax system. During the debate on the cost of compliance bill, I proposed that, as technology changes and the nature and incidence of employment and earnings grow more complicated as the years pass, the revenue raising means of a government will have to adapt to these changes. The government is choosing a most mechanical and intrusive approach and is enacting highly technical legislation. In the case of the compliance bill, the legislation imposed a liability on the employer. This will necessarily fetter or restrict an employer's or an individual's ability to produce earnings or a return on the capital that they may invest. The employment opportunities and further investment prospects are likewise restricted. That is the true meaning of the cost of compliance.

         The cost of compliance of any tax system or any part of a tax system goes beyond the monetary penalty and the opportunity cost to the existing taxpayers. Every legislative act or administrative act of government has an effect on the psychology of investment. I describe it simply as the atmospheric effect. Consideration has been given to the atmospheric effect caused by our tax system in a report by a group called the APEC Capital Markets Working Group, whom a newspaper article describes as `a group of business and financial market leaders who will lobby the Australian government to strengthen efforts for Australia to become a major financial centre in this region'. It is something that you hear quite a lot about in the government's rhetoric. This group of business and financial market leaders wrote a report which they presumably gave to the government. They pointed out quite clearly that Australia's tax system has a number of competitive disadvantages, including an international reputation for being unsympathetic to regional headquarters, and is considered to be a significant disincentive. There is really no point in saying anything further after hearing those comments from that group.

         You have to consider the position of the taxpayer—whether it be a corporate taxpayer or an individual—and how that person is treated by the tax office. Only yesterday I had a telephone call in my office from a constituent who was having his first tax audit. It sounded as though he was about to have his first child or his first dip in the sea at Bondi Beach. He was a little bit nervous about how the tax office was going to treat him, and he probably had good reason to be nervous about it.

          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         published an article by a former officer of the tax department, Mr Douglas. Mr Douglas is a lawyer who now practises as a partner with one of Sydney's larger law firms. He pointed out that, during his time in the tax office, the culture had changed as a result of some rather radical administrative changes. He said that they did not report in a horizontal fashion. The compliance officers, the lawyers within the tax office, are the doves. The hawks are the accountants, the bean counters, who in a rapacious fashion are out to squeeze every last cent from the taxpayer. The lawyers within the tax office take a more measured approach that emphasises the rights of the taxpayers. In the past, the compliance people had their own little section. The other section of the tax office, which dealt with individuals, large corporations, small corporations, rural producers and any other special working groups, would go to see the compliance group—that is, the lawyers—to check their work as they were carrying out audits. In that sense, there was a nice system of checks and balances on them. This was described as the horizontal style of organisation. For some reason, this was changed to a vertical system.

         The tax office was reorganised so that each section which dealt with large corporations, small corporations, individuals and so forth had their own little in-house compliance officer or officers. They were much smaller in number. This meant that the burden on them to check the work of the hawks, the people carrying out the audits, was so great that they began, through no fault of their own, to fail in their task.

         Mr Douglas also told me that working in the same physical environment with the compliance officers over in the corner of the office made them feel somehow intimidated when making decisions or giving advice that was adverse to the interests of the hawks. If one of the audit officers came up with a proposal to issue a draft ruling that would be adverse to the interests of the taxpayer and he was very keen to do this, the compliance officer with whom he might go out and have a beer on Friday or with whom he might socialise—like any other Australian office, people who work together occasionally spend time together outside work—might feel a little less inclined to perform his duties in a strict fashion. He may say to the audit officer, `Look, I think you're going a bit far with your proposed draft ruling.' He would go soft on it. In that sense, the hawks were getting their way.

         The reason given for this change in the culture of the tax office was enormous pressure on the tax office's revenue raising activity. That is clearly driven by a very loose fiscal discipline here in Canberra. From the top down, enormous pressure is placed on the tax office to raise as much revenue as possible with no regard to fairness. This reorganisation has given ascendancy to the hawks within the office. There is much to be done after the next election in reforming the way the tax office behaves when it deals with our citizens. No doubt after the election the government of this nation will change and a more sensible approach to this monstrous piece of legislation and its administrative underpinnings will be taken.

         Regarding the PAYE tax system, it seems as though this amendment is just another burden imposed on small and medium businesses. The existing law, as I understand it, says that companies which remit pay-as-you-earn tax deductions of under $5 million per month are obliged to remit them once a month. So the cost to their business of making the calculations and the bank charges that they will pay on that occur once a month.

         Suddenly, this threshold is to be reduced to $1 million. This will of course require many more companies to send in that money twice a month. For some of them, it will go close to nearly doubling the cost of performing that transaction. Again, the explanatory memorandum gives the reason for this. It is all because the government needs another $275 million in the 1995-96 year of income. There you have it—the loose fiscal discipline in Canberra working again to cause a bigger burden on the poor old innocent taxpayer.

         I point out to the House that the ABS has a relatively new indicator. It is called the composite leading indicator. It is composed of eight different indicators: economic statistics, which have some element of predictive capacity to them, and others that have great bearing on the prospects for Australia's real GDP movements—things like housing finance, the changes in the United States' real GDP and of course real interest rates, which are inverted in the calculation.

         The ABS put this together and then recalculated the figures going back to 1971. They do it quarterly. The significant thing is that in the June quarter of this year the index suffered its greatest quarterly fall since the June quarter of 1974. For the June quarter of 1995 this composite leading indicator suddenly falls off a cliff, as it does for 1974. If this indicator is a reliable guide to future movements in our own GDP—in the next, say, four quarters—we can say that it is not unreasonable to expect that our real GDP in the second or third quarter next year may be close to even negative.

No wonder Mr Murdoch had some comments to make about your Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his descriptions of Australia's success. Mr Murdoch does understand what the real needs of Australia are. He does understand the levels of youth employment. The Prime Minister says, `One of the reasons we've got high youth unemployment is Mr Murdoch is not getting involved in our make-work programs where the taxpayer funds a company to take on employees.'

         Australia has been left behind by many other countries in addressing its deficit. There is the deficit blow-out to 6.6 per cent of GDP. Comparable deficits were recorded by Finland, UK and Canada in 1989. We were at about the same level of deficit as a proportion of GDP as Finland, UK and Canada. In 1995 the OECD projects that these nations will be able to get on top of their current account deficits. The projections are: Finland, a current account surplus of 1.8 per cent; United Kingdom, a deficit of 0.1 per cent; and Canada, a deficit of 2.2 per cent. All of these performances are far better than Australia's. But the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister fail to acknowledge any of it.

The Prime Minister—despite all his shoving, skating and weaving—finally had to acknowledge that internal interest rates are affected by our foreign debt. Australia has the equal highest prime rate for corporate in the advanced industrial world. Australia's short-term three-month interest rate is exceeded only by Italy, Spain and Sweden—all countries that are running a higher deficit regime than Australia.

         When one looks at the impact of the debt on interest rates, one just has to quote the budget papers. The 1995-96 budget papers, on page 2.36, states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.
       </para>

        It is there in the budget papers and it has been there all the time. The Treasurer tried to avoid the fact that he knew it was there. In the 1993 report to the government on national savings, Vince Fitzgerald, the government's own employed consultant to look at savings and the direction the government was taking, said:

        We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        So it is there. We are paying much more for houses, cars and consumables of every sort because of the high interest regime the government has. Large current account deficits place upward pressures on rates. The Prime Minister jacked up interest rates in 1989 to rein in the current account deficit. Mortgage interest rates reached 18 per cent and led to the recession that we had to have.

         I guess at that time it was of no surprise to Australians to hear the Prime Minister make the claim that an economy which cannot travel at four per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away and that we ought to be able to run this economy at least at four per cent. It is not running at four per cent growth now. It is dropping off. And look at the mess that is still there. When the recovery got under way the Prime Minister still kept interest rates high to stabilise the current account in that way. The Commonwealth has been the prime driver in so many ways of Australia's deteriorating foreign debt. Vince Fitzgerald said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In short, the foreign debt position of Australia, and for that matter the current deficit, which is dominated by interest payments on the past accumulated debt, are attributable only to a small extent if at all to private sector net borrowing; rather they are essentially attributable to government and, indeed, to a significant extent represent borrowing to finance public consumption rather than investment, at least at the Commonwealth level.
       </para>
       <para>
        So what has that done? That has forced Australian borrowers off the Australian market and onto overseas markets. That has been detrimental to the nation as well. It has been the Australian management of it: not only has the debt been created by the government in its own thirst for funds to finance its own consumer programs, but also it has had the double whammy of forcing Australian companies offshore where they have had to borrow and where the government, of course, is paying a higher rate for money that it is borrowing—which means a higher interest rate the Australian taxpayer at one time will have to return.

A bite of every pension payment, a bite of every disability pension and a bite of every welfare benefit goes to paying taxes—the government's indirect tax regime. At the last federal election there was so much criticism of the coalition's GST proposals. But it is interesting to note that Labor is now collecting more from the indirect taxes the coalition was going to abolish than the coalition had aimed to collect from its GST. All of that has happened without any of the compensatory measures that the coalition was proposing. There are none of the alternative benefits that were going to be provided and none of the benefits to the national economy. Just on a raw tax basis, Labor is now collecting more from its sales taxes, its fuel excise and the like than the coalition would have collected from the GST.

         So there is no doubt about who are the big taxers in Australian history: it is the Labor government. In spite of all of the talk about simplification and tax cuts, the fact is that the burden gets greater each year and the complexity gets greater each year. That is one of the real tragedies of our current tax system. When the Income Tax Assessment Act became law in 1936, it contained just 126 pages. It had grown to 1,328 pages by 1983. So in its first almost 50 years it gained something like 1,200 pages. But in the life of the Labor government the Income Tax Assessment Act has grown close to 4,000 pages. In just 13 years, it has more than trebled in length. In all, Australia now has more than one million words of tax law spread over 7,000 pages. According to figures provided to a Senate estimates committee last year, it now costs more than $1.1 billion just to operate the Australian Taxation Office. That is almost four times what it cost a decade ago. The ATO now pays $213 million a year for leasing and maintaining its offices and is the biggest rent payer in most Australian capitals. At the time of that committee inquiry, the ATO had almost 18,000 permanent staff working in 25 separate offices to collect our tax.

         All of that cost is basically borne by the victims of the Australian tax system. A recent study by the Australian Tax Research Foundation found that it cost business $123 for every $100 of company tax it pays to the federal government. It will cost companies around $4 billion in hidden calculation and other compliance costs to pay next year's company tax bill. The costs in Australia are almost 11 times higher than those in the United Kingdom. For the majority of companies, the cost of compliance is higher than the amount of corporate tax that they pay. That is an incredible indictment on the current system. It costs most companies more in compliance costs than in actual tax. When we have a system of that nature, is it any wonder that business complains about the complexity of our tax law? This legislation fails to address those sorts of problems.

         The fact is many taxpayers come out of a tax audit with a very bad taste in their mouths, believing it was simply impossible to comply with existing legislation which has seen the legislative services division of the ATO writing such complex rules which now compel more and more specialist cells to be established in the ATO, because not one tax auditor could possibly understand the maze of legislation that exists.

The fact is that the existing law has become unreasonably complex and impossible for ordinary Australians to understand and comply with.

         The fringe benefits tax is the classic example of this.

It is almost impossible to keep the required documentation, so when the tax office comes along most businesses just ask in despair, `How much do you want?' and, instead of arguing, they pay up and shut up.

         There are a number of specific matters I would like to address in relation to this legislation. This might seem to be a very small matter, but I think it is one of some significance and importance. Just over a year ago, there was a terrible bus crash in Brisbane which took the lives of a number of my constituents. An inquiry into that bus crash was undertaken—as has happened with many other similar accidents in Australia over recent years—and it was recently completed. In almost all of those inquiries—certainly the inquiry into the crash of the Maryborough bus—it was stated that lives almost certainly would have been saved if passengers in the bus had been wearing seat belts. In fact, the federal and state governments have agreed to make the fitting of lap-sash seat belts compulsory in all new coaches.

         As new coaches are sales tax free, no sales tax applies to the seats and seat belts fitted to those vehicles. However, there are a small number of existing coaches which can be upgraded to meet the new safety standards with the fitting of new seats and lap sash belts. In cases where the seats and seat belts are retrofitted, incredibly, they attract sales tax at the rate of 22 per cent.

         Coach operators are not obliged to upgrade their existing vehicles to meet the standards applying to new coaches. They can continue to operate them indefinitely. I am told that the cost of fitting modified seats and lap sash belts to an existing coach is approximately $35,000 per vehicle, a significant amount. The imposition of a 22 per cent sales tax on such an investment is an enormous disincentive for any coach owner to introduce such improved safety measures.

         The Wide Bay Tours coach that was involved in the accident near Brisbane last year could not have been fitted with these seats. More often than not, the older coaches do not have adequate anchor points. You really need to build these in at the time the coach is constructed. But there are some coaches around, particularly those constructed in recent years, that could have the safer seating fitted.

If they were included in a product as part of a larger piece of machinery, the identical item would be sales tax free.

He does not look at ways in which the government might be prepared to save money; he prefers to place workers' lives at risk by imposing this ever-increasing sales tax on a product which could help save many people from electrical injury.

He admits it could be done, he admits it is an important safety feature, he admits there is anomaly but he will not do anything about it. Sadly, that is the approach so often taken by the government when anomalies in the current taxation system are drawn to their attention.

You voted against the capital gains tax. And the fringe benefits tax. What a rort! Under the now Leader of the Opposition, if you had the choice why would you take all of your income in cash?

         The other thing I said at the time we were debating the fringe benefits tax was that in most cases it is a voluntary tax. The government does not force firms to give people cars. The government does not force employers to say to people, `We will give you an around-the-world holiday,' or to pay any of the other expenses like a child's education expenses or private health insurance. We do not tell firms to do that. That is something they do themselves voluntarily. So if they are paying the fringe benefits tax, they are doing it because they choose to. Why do they not just cash it out? They would not be in the fringe benefits tax system any more.

         The last thing I will say about the taxation system is that you talk about high taxes. We have actually reduced John Howard's 60c to 47c and the 30c to 20c. That is always forgotten. What about 30c reduced to 20c? You do not think that helps the battlers? And we collect $3,500 million less tax than John Howard did as a percentage of GDP. So there you are.

         Let us get back to the bill. I have had a bit of fun here because I have been responding to some of the most outrageous claims we are getting from the opposition. I thought I would have to put them in their place. The member for Menzies and the Independent member for Curtin complained that the CFC amendments would have a retrospective effect. I remind members that the CFC provisions are anti-avoidance measures. The proposed amendments will simply overcome a weakness that has been exploited by parties seeking to escape accruals taxation on income that should be taxed under the CFC measures. The alternatives to their proposed treatment in the bill is to defer the commencement of the amendments by a year. That would allow all of these activities to flourish for another year and we are not going to do it.

         There was also some debate about the Superannuation Guarantee Act, about the changes that apply for reconstructions after the date of effect; that is, 1 July 1992. I am informed that the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia suggests early application of the amendments on the basis that the Treasurer's December 1991 information paper canvassed successor scheme restructuring. Many things are canvassed in papers but subject to submissions, discussion and review. So it was with possible successor scheme rules.

         The bill introduced in parliament on 2 April 1992 did not provide for employers to continue to contribute under a pre-1991 earnings base if they changed funds. It provided no successor scheme rule and parliament showed no intention of providing for such a rule in its consideration and passage of the bill which became the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 with effect from 1 July 1992.

         Employers who restructured their superannuation schemes before 28 June 1994 did so in the knowledge that the law required them to use the standard ordinary time earnings base after the restructure. True, the possibility of a successor fund rule was discussed before the law was made, but the law foreshadowed when it was introduced before the date for which it was to apply included no such rule. Until the Treasurer's statement of 28 June 1994, no employer had any reason to expect to keep a lesser earnings base after restructuring superannuation funds.

         The amendments apply from 1 July 1995 for restructures after the Treasurer announced these changes on 28 June 1994. Restructures before that time have already incurred the cost of changing to the standard base ordinary time earnings and restructures before that time were made with no reasonable expectation of going back to a lesser measure for superannuation contribution. For this reason, these amendments apply only in relation to restructures occurring after the Treasurer's announcement.

        The first of the amendments to which I refer seeks to replace words `ending after 30 June 1995' with `commencing after 30 June 1995'. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has already alluded to the reason. It involves a matter of retrospectivity. Let me say at the outset I have no objection to the intention of the clause to come to grips with avoidance practices. I made that abundantly clear in my speech on the second reading. This matter of retrospectivity has been raised by representatives of concerned taxpayers—notably, but not exclusively, the Corporate Tax Association.

         I have covered many of my reasons in my speech in the second reading debate so I will not traverse the whole raft of those. On the matter of the changes affecting the tainted income of controlled foreign companies, CFCs, there is indeed a retrospective element. I think the Assistant Treasurer has acknowledged that in summing up the second reading debate. It applies to companies whose financial year, or tax years, if you prefer, did not end on 30 June 1995. The explanatory memorandum states—and I will go over that again:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the amendments will clarify that the Commissioner of Taxation may make adjustments, reflecting arm's length values, to amounts used in determining whether a CFC has passed the income test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regret that the Assistant Treasurer, for whatever reason, was not here during my speech on the second reading but I am sure he has got the gist of it from the advisers. The problem is that the government amendment, as it now stands, will be applied retrospectively for accounting periods ending after 30 June this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         It is therefore axiomatic that part of the relevant tax year to attract this burden occurs before 30 June 1995 and therefore becomes taxable for that part of the tax year prior to 30 June last. Therefore, the measure is applicable from 1 July 1995 and, as a consequence, it will in some cases have a retrospective impact on the attributable income of CFCs. The amendment I am proposing to clause 20 of schedule 1 will ensure that no company which has a statutory accounting period other than one which involves the end of a financial year on 30 June will be affected by the application of the new tainted income rules.

         I want to stress that not many companies do not wrap up their tax years or financial years on dates other than 30 June each year. Therefore, there is not much revenue involved in this. It is unquantifiable, I guess, but there is very little involved in this. That just makes it even more important to me that there should be an absence of retrospectivity and there is really no excuse for not treating taxpayers equitably. It is only fair.

       <para first-indent="16">

         Remember that it has only limited application. Because it has only limited application, it is not worth breaching a principle of abhorrence of retrospectivity which we should hold if we value certainty under the law. My proposal is only fair because, as the bill now stands, a company has, for example, a statutory accounting period ending on 30 September 1995, the tainted income provisions of this tax amendment bill becoming applicable from 1 October 1994—that being the beginning of that particular accounting period.

         There is no need for revenue or other reasons. There is a good case to be made out on equity grounds for accepting this amendment. I just want to finish by saying that presence of retrospective legislation does undermine certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. Retrospectivity is a denial of natural justice, in my view, and a repudiation of fairness in that system.

         Turning to amendment No. 2, government amendments Nos 3 and 4 will address certain transfers pursuant to a court order but only where there is no arrangement to pay a dividend from the amounts transferred. It would not be appropriate to allow dividends from amounts transferred from disqualifying accounts to be rebatable or frankable, even if they were transferred pursuant to a court order. This is because these dividends could enable the reduction of taxable capital gains by corporate tax holders and franking credit trading.

This will, in turn, ensure that other amendments being made to this part of the bill do not give rise to multiple capital losses for the one payment and that the subsection does not deny earlier years' net capital losses that may already have been offset against capital gains.

         Hence, I moved those amendments. I must say that I like mine better if they have the desired effect because mine happen to be only two paragraphs long, whereas these happen to be 2 1/4 pages long.

         It has been brought to my attention by the Taxation Institute that sometimes a new holding company may apply to a court in order to access reconstruction profits for permission to transfer amounts from the share premium account to retained earnings as part of a corporate reconstruction. The bill as it currently stands, and without my amendment and before the government's amendment is adopted, will deny a company that has received court approval for such a transfer the ability to frank dividends associated with the payment of dividends from such amounts. I have covered that at length in my speech in the second reading debate. The anti-avoidance nature of the legislation should impact on court sanction transfers from share capital and share premium accounts to retained earnings. That is the reason for my concern. I believe that my amendment rectified the problem on the best advice available to me.

         —A few weeks ago a virus deadly to the Australian feral rabbit population escaped from a fenced off quarantine area four miles off the coast of South Australia on Wardang Island. Apparently, it stayed on the island for some time. This virus—the rabbit calicivirus—was being tested by a consortium of the CSIRO, the state DPI and the Animal and Plant Control Commission of South Australia with, I understand, involvement from the New Zealand government, the NFF, the wool board, the Wool Corporation and so forth.

         The escape raises the possibility that a vector—perhaps a bush fly or other carrier—is able to transfer the virus from one area or another with deadly result to the rabbit. Up till now scientists have only thought that the infection could move from one rabbit to another by very close physical contact.

         The rabbit, apart from the advent of the European perhaps, has probably turned out to be the most effective imported destroyer of the environment in the history of this country—or probably, for that matter, in the history of any country. No feral animal has destroyed more vegetation and produced erosion and false drought than has the European rabbit in this country for 100 years. Even after the advent of the very successful myxomatosis virus, which has been operating for some 25 years, the numbers of rabbits are still in the tens of millions, and we are failing to handle the increase in those numbers at the present time.

         There is no doubt that the number of rabbits got to a high of between 600 million and a billion in this country. I remember as a small boy seeing thousands of pairs of ears in the evening light—the ground bare, warren-ridden and pockmarked—and in some cases rabbits were 10 feet up the trees, ringbarking the bullock bushes as they went.

         Some people earn a living out of rabbits at the present time as a sort of offshoot of this feral population by either shooting or harvesting them in some way or another. That is fine, but in this case all those people in effect are living off the destruction by the rabbit of private property and the destruction of our landscape.

         There have been some statements in recent times, since this escape, which I would have to say are somewhat irresponsible. I refer to some statements by Dr Hugh Wirth. I know that Hugh Wirth for five or six years has felt, as President of the RSPCA, that we should be using more humane methods. But I would like to point out to him that since that time, five or six years ago, the debate has come a long way. Last year the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales conducted a two-day seminar, the whole purpose of which was to discuss ways of eradication of feral animals in Australia. That was a big move when you think back to the animal liberation debate of only a few years ago.

         We simply do not have the luxury of not using the good fortune that we may now have found ourselves in. We have found a vector to move this thing around. It is worth pointing out that this RCV virus is in 40 countries. So far it has never proved effective on anything but the European rabbit. Even other wild rabbits in other countries have not been affected, as I understand it. Some people obviously do not know what the current procedure is. As myxomatosis has become less effective, we are back to the old-fashioned methods of poisoning, bulldozing and what have you with the commensurate destruction of the environment in those areas where that is happening.

         When the disease—as it is now on the mainland—is brought back under CSIRO control, which I hope happens in the near future, I hope that these experiments go on, because after 80 years of all the money and effort that we have put into trying to get rid of our most destructive imported pests it would seem to me to be ridiculous to go in any other direction. There are absolutely no positive results from the rabbit in Australia—not in any way whatsoever.

         —This evening I wish to speak about an issue that is dear to my heart, and that is the seven years of neglect of the Hunter region under the Fahey government. I particularly want to talk about facilities for young athletes in the region. Members opposite will probably not be aware that the Hunter has a greater population than Tasmania and contributes more to the GDP of this nation than most areas—indeed, more than the whole of Tasmania—yet we do not have a single first-class athletic facility. This is an area that is less than two hours drive from Sydney that is going to host the Olympics in the year 2000.

         I was very pleased the other day to hear, less than six months after coming to power, Michael Egan, the Treasurer for New South Wales, indicate that he will pursue the establishment of a first-class facility in the Hunter region. It will be a regional facility, and hopefully it will be constructed on surplus railway land in the suburb of Glendale, which is in the electorate of my very good friend and colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown).

         This will mean that athletes in our area who do have a national and state ranking will be able to train seriously towards representing their country at the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. Athletes such as Katie Hall, Jacquie Munro, Mindy Slomka, Andrew Laverick, Lucas Moffat and Clinton Mackevicius—not all residents of my electorate but people from around the Hunter region—and dozens of others will now have the opportunity to train with first-class facilities, so guaranteeing that they will be competitive and that Australia will be proud of the effort that they put in.

         Apart from that, the injection of $4 million, plus the availability of land on which this facility can be constructed, provides another avenue for helping young people in the Hunter region—and that is employment. I have already approached officers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training and I have approached my federal colleagues from the Hunter and suggested that we should look, under the Working Nation program, at training programs being involved in the development of these facilities. I am confident it will happen. After all, I am sure the skills that young people will learn as they are constructing these facilities will be in great demand in Australia in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. They will be constructing sporting facilities that will be in high demand, not only by Australian athletes but by athletes who will come here for up to 12 months before the Olympics actually take place to acclimatise themselves to Australian standards.

Although it is not as good as the Hunter, it is still quite a good area and certainly close to the major competition centres.

         —Tonight I would like to raise an issue highlighted by the Chairman of the CSIRO, Professor Adrienne Clarke, in her Brodie-Hall address in Perth the night before last. Professor Clarke is one of Australia's leading scientists. She mentioned that Australia risked losing control over one of the most powerful technologies reshaping today's society. She said in her speech that biotechnology is critical to Australia's future in agriculture, the environment and medicine. With the world population predicted to rise to at least 10 billion by the year 2050, biotechnology could transform agriculture and how food is supplied to the world's population.

         What is biotechnology? In Professor Clarke's words, biotechnology is based on two key pieces of knowledge: firstly, we can grow cells of living organisms, plants, animals, bacteria and fungi in culture in artificial conditions and, secondly, we can isolate the genetic material that defines the nature of these cells and move these genes from one cell to another, known as genetic engineering. The main impact of this technology has been felt in agriculture and medicine, but applications in fields such as forensic science, security and mining are becoming commonplace.

         Some examples of recent developments include the first engineered fresh tomato, now being sold in shops in the USA, and tomato paste is being manufactured from engineered tomatoes in the United Kingdom. The UK also has green cheese made genetically, and engineered rennet is marketed in the United Kingdom as green cheese, as it does away with using rennet from the stomachs of baby calves.

         In the area of medicine, children in developing countries can now receive vaccine for cholera and hepatitis B by eating  a genetically engineered banana. On the other side of the coin, biotechnology is all about ownership of that information. There are many controversial issues about patenting, access and equity of that information. Professor Clarke warned that Australia is in very real danger of missing the biotechnology train and being left on the outer, with little control over its developing future. At the moment, rights of advancements and new discoveries made in Australia are usually sold to overseas interests. That means Australia gives up the rights of core technologies and then in the future has to pay the price to use that technology. For example, for every chicken eaten in Australia a royalty is paid to overseas owners.

         Professor Clarke said it is critical that Australia retain control over its own emerging and core technologies, and that this means substantial investment by Australian business in Australian research and commercialisation of products. She said that Australia has the scientific capacity within CSIRO, the universities and a few fledgling companies to be among the world leaders in a few carefully targeted areas. But Australia is a very small player on the international scene and probably accounts for between two and four per cent of all new knowledge in this area, which is about right for our size.

         The question is whether Australia has the framework to retain control over the technology we do develop. Professor Clarke says that presently we probably do not. If Australia fails to change its approach to this issue, it runs the very real risk of losing control of this matter. Professor Clarke argued that a structure similar to the one which kick-started the film industry is essential to commercialise Australian discoveries in biotechnology. I ask the government to consider various policies which could encourage Australian companies to invest in Australian technology.

         Senator Schacht, in his opening address at the last Pacific rim biotechnology conference, said that Australia was aiming to be a leader in innovations, science and advanced industry within the Asia-Pacific region. While Australia has the ability to be a leader in technology, we do not appear to be able to maintain Australian ownership of these rights. Our future is at stake and the government must provide leadership in this area and encourage a climate that is attractive to Australian companies and agencies investing in our technological future.

         I am appalled at the fact that the Victorian Premier, with the cosy complicity of his close friends who operate the Melbourne casino, has blithely accepted the proposition that this is the one major business undertaking that must be permitted to operate on the morning of Anzac Day, when ceremonies are taking place, and on Good Friday and Christmas Day—days of immense religious significance to members of my community. These are family days. These are days for personal reflections. These are days when `the money changers have no place in the temple'.

         For the operators of the casino, it is a redistribution that is immensely profitable for them. For the Victorian government, it is about collecting an indirect tax, a tax that for the most part falls most heavily on those who cannot afford it. To the Premier who has sacked judges, limited rights to compensation, whose commitment to privatisation exceeds his commitment to social equity and justice, I say: enough is enough. Nobody believes that Anzac Day morning, Christmas Day and Good Friday are essential to the operations of a casino. These days are sacred days for the people of Victoria and Melbourne and they are not to be transgressed by the Premier on behalf of his friends.

I for one accept the sincerity of their commitments as the legislation received the unanimous endorsement of the House. These commitments do not live with the Victorian Premier's cosy complicity with the decision that fundamentally attacks those very commitments, with the decision that involves a placid acceptance that the Melbourne casino is the one and only business that can operate on Christmas Day, Good Friday and the morning of Anzac Day.

Anzac Day and what it stands for are too important. These other sacred ceremonies are too important. They should not be cast aside in terms of the business interests of those who are in positions of power and, unfortunately, are close friends of the Premier of Victoria.

        This bill gives effect to an important element in the government's package of shipping reform measures which was announced in the budget on 9 May 1995. The reform package continues the improvement in efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's major trading fleet, and assists in closing the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its major international competitors.

         This bill introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australia's international shipping industry employers, based on the PAYE tax liabilities of seafarers on Australia's international trading ships. In addition to the introduction of the grant under this bill, the reform package includes two other key elements:

         Firstly, the extension from 1 July 1997 until 30 June 2002 of the existing capital assistance measures available under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and the associated accelerated depreciation regime under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These measures, which at least equate to the capital incentives provided by other shipping nations, will encourage the continued investment in modern ships.

         The structure of the government's reform package is based upon the recommendations of the August 1994 report by the then Chairman of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, Mr Rae Taylor AO. This report recognised the achievement of the reform programs implemented by government and the shipping industry since the early 1980s. These reforms had focused on reductions in crewing levels, a radical restructure of seafarer training and the introduction of modern, technologically advanced, fuel efficient ships into the Australian fleet.

         Over the past decade Australian shipowners have invested some $1.6 billion in new tonnage. The average age of ships in the Australian fleet is 11 years, compared with 18 years in the world fleet. In 1983, a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33; today, that figure is 18. While in 1983 the Australian average crew size was well in excess of OECD levels, our crew levels are now lower. These are remarkable achievements.

         Over recent years there has been a trend by OECD national flag operators towards registering their vessels under open or international registers. These registers typically offer attractive taxation regimes and the ability to replace wholly national crews with lower-cost mixed nationality crews, predominantly from the developing countries.

         The Taylor report found that, as a result of this changed overseas situation, the competitive gap between Australian ships and comparable overseas ships operating under international registers was about $2 million per ship per year. The report, having examined the main areas of cost disabilities affecting Australian shipping, concluded that the PAYE taxation regime had a major impact on Australia's competitive position. Accordingly, the report recommended removal of the PAYE taxation cost element from Australia's international trading ships in order to match the position of overseas ship operators, where crews are exempt from PAYE taxation or where the taxation impact on crew costs is offset by other concessions.

         The government accepted the thrust of the Taylor report findings. After examining a range of options in the crew taxation area, the government has decided that a grant based on the notional tax liabilities of seafarers serving on ships trading internationally would be the most effective and practicable means of achieving the objective. The bill now before the House introduces from 1 July 1995 an annual taxable grant payable in arrears to Australian shipping industry employers, based on the notional PAYE taxation liabilities on the earnings of Australian-resident crew members on ships in Australia's international trading fleet. Seafarers will, of course, have their PAYE tax deducted in the normal way and, like every other taxpayer, will be able to claim the rebates and deductions to which they are entitled in respect of their total earnings for the year.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Part 2, which takes in clauses 3 to 7, explains the expressions and definitions used in the bill. Clause 3 defines an `eligible ship' to mean `an Australian-operated commercial trading ship with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tonnes or more'. Clause 4 defines an `Australian-operated' ship to include ships on demise charter to Australian entities, as well as ships owned by Australians.

         Clause 5 defines the meaning of `international voyage'. This is an important definition, as time spent on international voyages is one of the key criteria for qualifying for the grant. Calls at intermediate Australian ports as part of an overall international voyage are permitted, provided that any coastal cargo carried between Australian ports does not exceed the international cargo on board. In clause 7 are to be found general definitions, such as `seafarer', `Australian-resident seafarer' and `seafarer berth'. These again are important definitions as the grant is only payable in respect of bona fide, duly qualified seafarers who are ordinarily resident in Australia.

         I would mention at this point that the term `seafarer berth' is used throughout the bill in the sense of a crew position or job on a ship, rather than simply a cabin or a bed. By adopting the concept of the seafarer berth and using the notional tax on the award wages or enterprise agreement wages, as applicable for that berth, the computation of the grant amount is reduced to a relatively straightforward calculation.

         Part 3 of the bill, which covers clauses 8 to 12, contains the elements for establishing the entitlement to the grant and calculating the grant amount. Clause 8 sets the basic parameters for entitlement to the grant. Essentially, the grant is payable to the employer of the crew of an eligible ship which has spent the requisite number of days in international trade. Clause 9 sets out the method of calculating the amount of grant unit for each seafarer berth. Factored into the grant calculation is the number of days in the year that each berth is actually occupied by an Australian-resident seafarer. Therefore, if any berths are occupied by nonresidents, or if any berths are unoccupied during a repair or lay-up period or because the ship is sailing short-handed, then the grant units calculated for those berths will be reduced proportionately. The grant amount is simply the sum of the grant units for the seafarer berths on the ship.

         Clause 10 establishes the eligible employment period, which is the period in respect of which the grant is paid. This clause also determines that the grant is to be paid to the actual employer of the crew and that the employer must be an Australian entity.

         A number of ship operators in Australia appoint a management company to look after the day-to-day running of the ship, including crew related matters such as paying salaries and making the PAYE tax deductions. In such circumstances, it would be the management company that is the actual employer, not the operator. Because of the notional linkage between the grant and crew PAYE income tax, it follows that the employer of the crew is the appropriate recipient of the grant. Clearly, if the employer and the ship operator are not the same entity, they will need to reach a commercial agreement on the allocation of the grant moneys once paid.

         If the employer employs the crew on a ship for the whole year, the `eligible employment period' is the whole year. If the employer only employs the crew for a part year, then the `eligible employment period' would only apply to the part year. These eligible employment periods are not transferable. For example, if during the period covered by the first employer the ship is wholly engaged in international trading and during the period covered by the second employer the ship is mainly engaged in coastal trading, the international trading days accrued by the first employer could not be transferred to the second employer.

         Clause 11 sets out the formula for calculating the minimum number of days in international trading to qualify for the grant. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will note that the formula excludes non-operational days of repair, maintenance or lay-up from the minimum days calculation. There will thus be no advantage for an operator to obtain repairs, or lay-up the ship, overseas simply in order to accumulate more international trading days. However, once a ship has crossed the minimum days international trading threshold, the grant is payable in respect of the berth occupancy over the full eligible employment period, which would include any days of repairs, maintenance or lay-up. The grant will be paid annually in arrears after receipt of appropriate documentation from the employer.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, through this bill, the crew taxation disadvantages for Australian operators will be eliminated. Furthermore, by providing the benefit direct to employers, the whole amount will be directed to narrowing the competitive gap. This bill, together with the industry reforms implemented through the maritime industry restructuring agreement, will promote a more competitive international fleet. It must be remembered that, as recently as 25 years ago, Australian shipping had minimal involvement in international trades. Now there are some 30 ships regularly trading overseas. These ships are competing directly with overseas operated vessels at prevailing international freight rates, largely by exploiting market niches. This government's previous shipping reform measures have played a major role in this achievement.

         The reason we will be opposing this legislation is that this is simply yet another rort for the Maritime Union of Australia, the great friends of the Labor Party here in Canberra and around Australia. As the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, will tell you, the Maritime Union of Australia is the heart and soul of the Labor movement in Australia, and it is for this reason that the taxpayers of Australia are dipping into their pockets to the tune of $19 million, in this specific instance, as they have been dipping into their pockets, or the government on their behalf has been dipping very deeply into their pockets, over the last many years to fund the rorts of the Maritime Union of Australia in various activities this government has embarked upon for them.

         In this particular case we are spending $19 million of taxpayers' funds as the consequence of a deal that was struck to try and resolve a dispute that I think basically revolves around the privatisation of ANL. We can all recall a strike that took place last year as a consequence of the decision by the government to sell the share of Australian Stevedores, now known as Patricks, that was owned by ANL. You will recall a dispute that took place at that time, a national waterfront strike that cost this country probably in the order of $60 million in direct costs and many millions of dollars more in terms of indirect costs because of the enhanced reputation for unreliability this country has for its waterfront. As a result of that dispute, the government decided to do yet another taxpayer funded deal for its mates in the Maritime Union of Australia, and here we are today with living evidence of the cost of that deal.

Today in the press, in relation to the sale of ANL, which is a central feature of the Australian shipping industry and indeed is seen as an icon by the Maritime Union of Australia, we see the farce, and the very expensive farce, of the incompetence of the government's management of the sale of ANL. It reflects also the incompetence of the government's management of our shipping and maritime industries here in Australia.

         We now find out that we are not likely to have the sale of ANL to P&amp;O proceed, as we had been told would be the case by the government since early this year. The Maritime Union of Australia has in effect vetoed the sale of ANL to P&amp;O on the grounds that it basically does not like P&amp;O. There has been a historic fight between the Maritime Union of Australia and P&amp;O, and as a consequence of it this government has handed over to the Maritime Union of Australia the veto rights on the privatisation of ANL. We see that the Maritime Union of Australia has done exactly what people predicted would be done, and that is use that veto to stop the sale and to leave the ANL shipping company in the hands of the Australian government.

Indeed, somewhere in the order of $145 million is the cost of the fiasco of ANL. That is the cost of this government's bowing down to the influence and pressures the MUA has imposed on the government over the management of and ultimate attempt to privatise ANL. It is some $145 million, plus $19 million per annum, plus the $816,000 that has been paid to Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and one other member of the ANL board.

         We question a number of points made in the speech given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous). He was simply reading a speech prepared by the minister's office, which he did with some degree of competence. For example, the government likes to use the great line which says that crew numbers of Australian ships are equal to those of international shipping trading nations. It is true, crew numbers are equal, but the fact of the matter is that crew to berth ratios in Australia for Australian flag vessels are much higher than those of most other shipping nations around the world.

         It takes 2.3 crew to fill every berth on an Australian ship. A comparable nation with a much more efficient shipping industry would require about 1.7 crew per berth to fill each position on its ships. So here in Australia, because of the work practices in our maritime industry—six weeks on, six weeks off, somebody on sick leave, somebody on long service leave and somebody doing some training—it requires more crew to keep an Australian flag vessel operating than it does vessels from other countries.

         Despite all of the costs that the Australian taxpayers have had to fork out, despite all of the talk, all of the time and all of the effort involved in trying to generate shipping reform in Australia, we still do not have a shipping industry that is competitive on all of the important points with other shipping nations.

The MUA, for some reason, is so important that this government will not stand up to it, and will not do anything but dip into the taxpayer's pocket to try to solve the problem. Here today we have an example of precisely that: the taxpayers having another $19 million ripped out of their pockets by this government, to try to solve a little domestic problem for the labour movement in Australia.

         There are a number of factors that have to be considered in this debate. One factor is the cost of the grant. When the government first announced the provision of a tax-free status for international seafarers, it was supposed to be a tax arrangement. It was not intended, as far as we could understand, to be given in the form of a direct grant. It is interesting to note that this grant is valued at about $19 million a year. You watch over the next few years, as coastal traders start to rearrange their schedules to ensure that they are eligible for the grant as well. I will bet my bottom dollar on the fact that those people in the coastal trades will see an opportunity to get some money for themselves out of this scheme; they will make rearrangements to their schedules, and they will have their snouts in the trough by getting into this grant system as well.

Farmers, in my electorate, have received very good assistance. I am very proud to say that we were able to assist those who needed assistance due to the droughts in Tasmania. RAS has put millions and millions of dollars into rural Australia. Farmers make great gains from reforms that have already occurred on the waterfront through technologies. I went to the terminal at Botany Bay where 50 per cent reform has occurred in the container area. A lot of that has to do with technology and electronic transfers. When things come in containers, the computers take over when they hit the waterfront. The wharfie driving the forklift gets the information and is better able to stack the yards. When the ship comes in, it is much easier. Those sorts of reforms have taken place and the whole economy of Australia gains from that, including our rural sector.

         Most shipowners knew with precision the details of a wide variety of assistance measures made available in a number of OECD countries which were not available in Australia. Japan, the United States of America, France, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom were used as examples of differing approaches to international shipping industries. This intelligence was used to demonstrate the impact of different measures on the cost regime of Australian ships. The measures tested had to be commercially, politically and industrially sensitive and had to have equal application to vessels being operated by owners in a variety of commercial circumstances. The common factor was reduction in labour costs, but it was thought this should not be done at the expense of employees on the ships. So it was decided to look at the Danish idea of removing the PAYE element from the employer's gross payroll and that was adopted.

         It was industrially neutral as it did not encourage the employment of foreign nationals; it was of equal benefit to all operators as it reduced labour costs; and it was politically sustainable as it would apply to Australian taxpayers who were absent from the country for a very substantial period during the year. Thus there was no change to the employees' net pay. So this bill should assist in the growth of Australian shipping.

         In 1993-94 foreign shipping carrying Australia's external trade accounted for about $2.5 billion of our deficit on net services in the current account. This represented, by itself, 15 per cent of the current account deficit in 1993-94.

         It seems that operators of coastal shipping are already rearranging their shipping schedules to ensure the eligibility of their ships for a grant under the terms of this bill. The effect of this will be to reduce the operating costs of those ships and the resultant savings will directly benefit the users of coastal shipping services. So although I believe this bill will be useful to help Australian owned and crewed ships, I would still like the whole arrangement to be considered so that ANL still remains part of our culture and our industry, and is owned by Australia. I have great pleasure in supporting the bill.

         —I have listened carefully to the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) trying to defend the government's position on the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995 and I am in some difficulty in understanding the line of reasoning. The bottom line is that the government is subsidising ANL to the extent of $20 million in an attempt to buy off the Maritime Union of Australia. They have put pressure on the government by way of strike action and the government has caved in and tried to do a deal with the union in an endeavour to keep Australian ports open.

         The member for Lyons struggled valiantly to defend that position with some facts and some figures that are not really relevant to the main argument. The situation is that this ANL saga is hopefully coming to a conclusion. We see in this morning's press that it still remains to be finally concluded with a sale to P&amp;O. Again, the MUA are instrumental in preventing that final sale, but I will deal with that in a moment.

         This particular bill is the legislative conclusion of a deal brokered between the government and the ACTU and the Maritime Union on 13 September 1994 after the MUA had instigated a five-day national strike to gain their point of view. They were worried, as we all know, about the future sale of ANL and what might turn up. The government has been trying to sell ANL since 1991. In September last year the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) relied on one valuation and said, in his classic quote, that ANL `could not be given away'.

         In the House of Representatives only 10 days ago most of us on our side of politics clearly set out the arguments of the strange and wide range of valuations of ANL that took place, and yet that shipping line has yet to be sold. Minister Brereton sacked the board, put the ANL back for sale and, as of today, we have P&amp;O making the offer of $19.5 million, less the losses that have been accrued from 1 April to 31 October. It is estimated that ANL is losing $2 million a month. So not only has the sale not gone through, but the government is certainly accumulating losses at a rapid rate.

         We have it quite clearly where the ACTU stand and where the Maritime Union stand in the whole argument. The maritime waterfront strike was used for blackmailing purposes, closing the ports for five days in order to get their point of view across. I draw the attention of the parliament to the political blockade that took place in Western Australia only yesterday. It had similar connotations and similar points of view, that is, the Western Australian government, legitimately, were threatening the privileged position of the trade union bosses in that state.

         Other reforms included no more political donations from membership subscriptions to a particular party unless people decided to make that particular donation to a political party, a choice of a superannuation fund and not being coerced into a superannuation fund because the union hierarchy told people they had to do it, and ensuring that the unions chose between a state and federal award. They are all quite sensible suggestions and no basis for the major strike which held up the whole of Western Australia yesterday.

         Similarly, we have the situation with the MUA using their considerable clout to hold up the ports around Australia just to get their own way. As Greg Bondar, the executive director of the Australian Chamber of Shipping, estimated, the national waterfront strike cost shipping $55 million.

         The Australian Chamber of Shipping further estimated that 200 ships had been stuck in Australian ports during the five-day stoppage. To end the strike, which is the key argument, Minister Brereton offered an exemption of PAYE tax for all Australian seafarers engaged in international shipping. That was the deal after all this argument. As usual Minister Brereton said, `Here's a bit of a deal,' through Mr Kelty, his friend in the ACTU, `This is the way we will solve it.' Whilst the workers did not receive any additional take home pay, the exemption would make Australian seafarers up to $20,000 cheaper to employ, if you do some of the figures.

         It is interesting to look at the figures. According to the Australian Shipowners Association, the base rate of pay for crew members is $40,000 per annum. That is not a bad rate of pay by anyone's standards. They have six months on and six months off. Again, that is not a bad set of conditions. They are on board 24 hours a day seven days a week and it is obviously fairly difficult and arduous work—I concede that. They work eight hours a day plus overtime.

         The Shipping Industry Reform Authority estimates the savings to this particular taxpayer subsidy would be in the range of $700,000 per annum. Obviously, shipowners are quite happy about receiving, yet again, a taxpayer subsidy to keep their operation going. The key element is the tax break which has been suggested. Mr David Russell of the Taxation Institute of Australia said that the decision to provide PAYE tax breaks would produce a greater complexity in the tax system.

Both Treasury and the tax office felt that the concession would be better provided through direct grant payments rather than through tax exemptions. However, as usual, Minister Laurie Brereton was not convinced, and the

Needless to say, on this occasion, Treasury won and Minister Brereton lost. It is really an outrageous proposal to suggest that particular workers in the Australian context would have their tax paid by way of a direct government grant.

         The grants that the government is proposing total $19 million per year, just to win a short-term political impasse between the union movement and the government. The argument was between the government's proposal to sell the ANL—quite legitimately; it has been up-front about that since 1991—and the Maritime Union being unhappy about that. These grants, on the basis on which they were originally proposed, were a blatant breach of the principles of original PAYE tax exemption, and they still remain a pay-off to the union, as I say.

What a remarkable thing, when ANL has been losing money for most of its existence! The Australian taxpayers—and the government, might I say—are now sick of that and are going to sell the operation.

         The government is claiming that the grants are being made following a recommendation by Mr Rae Taylor of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. The Taylor report, issued in August 1994, stated that Australia's international shipping industry faced competitive disadvantages due to high government taxes and charges—I stress that they were high government taxes—as well as inefficient wages and conditions for crew. Some of us, including the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), have been very close to these arguments over the past few years in terms of improvements, but we note in the Taylor report that government charges were one of the key factors in our shipping arrangements being internationally non-competitive.

         The Taylor recommendations included a clawing back of the cabotage protection, smaller crew sizes, and tax exemptions for the industry. Following the five-day national waterfront strike, the only recommendation which the government followed up was the PAYE tax exemption, along with a guarantee to the MUA that Australian crewing and award conditions would remain on the ANL. That is the key to the whole argument that P&amp;O is concerned about. If it purchases this particular operation, P&amp;O wants to have its own terms and conditions as it sees fit in a commercial operation; and, of course, the MUA just will not agree with that.

As I understand it, there are 21 Australian shipowners and 78 Australian owned and registered flag ships, and 30 of these are involved in international shipping.

On 13 September 1994, at a time when 40,000 Australian farmers were affected by the worst drought on record, the government found only $14 million to assist them. On the one hand, we have 1,200 seafarers who are close to the government and close to Mr Kelty. The seafarers are receiving $20 million and yet the government could find only $14 million to assist farmers who are providing valuable and important export income and there are very carefully regulated conditions about the way in which the assistance could be given. With the farmers, there was not an open cheque as is the situation with the shipowners. The poor old Australian farmers struggled through that drought as best they could and with very little government assistance because they did not have the entree to the ACTU that the Maritime Union of Australia obviously does.

Employers have had no choice but to pay up, although since they could pass the cost on in higher port and shipping charges, they have not complained much until recent years, when there has been more pressure from customers as a result of micro-economic reform elsewhere in the economy.

I am not one to criticise the waterside workers. I think there are a number of other elements on the waterfront—the stevedores, the shipowners and some of the historical pressures—that need improving. But this particular decision by the government does not encourage anyone on the waterfront to expect that better, more stable and more sensible conditions could prevail. It sets the clock back to a situation where the government, in times of crisis, will always ask the poor old taxpayer to pay up yet again to solve an internal, domestic, political, union problem.

It is an export measure to try to put Australian shipping on a more equal footing in the international market for the trades. So not one dollar, not one cent, of the measures in this legislation goes to Australian seafarers. The honourable member for Corangamite also makes reference to drought assistance. I do not recall hearing him complain that farmers were not being generously treated and there was consultation and involvement of the farmer organisations. The farmer organisations had some difficulty with the National Party, and with the opposition, but not so much with the government.

         Shipping is an important industry to this country. In 1992-93, our exports totalled more than $60 billion and those commodities included meat, minerals, fuels, manufactures, coal and processed foods. Approximately 70 per cent of our agricultural products and the vast majority of our mineral resources are exported and traded in overseas markets. In this context shipping is a vital component of the nation's economy and of Australia's ability to meet international trade demands.

         When we turn to Australian shipping, the Australian Shipowners Association, in partnership with the maritime trade unions, has over the last few years embarked on a restructuring of the industry. It is a restructuring that has produced cost savings in the vicinity of $7 million per annum. Australian shipping is now amongst the most labour efficient in the world and crewing levels have been reduced from 30 on average to 18 per vessel. That is lower than OECD levels and well below the world average of 23. In contrast to the increasing age of international ships, which on average is 17 years, the average age of Australian ships is 10 years. It is a younger fleet.

The challenge for Australia is to place our shipping on a similar footing to that which operates in the nations of our competitors. That means we need to develop and make markets.

        This legislation will place Australian ship operators on a more equal footing with their international competitors in respect of crew costs and provide an incentive to the Australian shipping industry to develop new international trading opportunities. The government's principal aim is to ensure that Australian ship operators have continued access to competitive liner services and are able to expand their trade interests. The grant is, as I said earlier, payable to employers who are Australian nationals. It is not payable to Australian seafarers. They pay their taxes and are in exactly the same position as any Australian taxpayer. Under the legislation, to qualify for the benefit a vessel must be engaged in international voyages, with a minimum number of days being half of its operation days.

Why are they doing that, when we can see to the north of us that the Asian nations—Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines—are all pushing and developing their international shipping industries and their ports as international ports? With the policy advice going forth to successive governments in this country, irrespective of the political complexion of those governments, it is no wonder, on looking back, that the policies have been against Australian shipping and against Australian seafarers.

         Shipping is at the foundation of the entire range of Norwegian maritime activities, which go far beyond shipping itself. This is one of the things that drives me with Australian shipping. Shipping is not just about shipping: it is one link in the chain. In Norway, other related activities are shipbuilding, manufacturing of ships' equipment, financing, ship-broking, insurance, legal services, classification, and education and research. It is estimated that in a population of 4 1/4 million people, between 60,000 and 70,000 people are involved in activities related to the shipping industry. We in this country can learn a lot from that.

         —I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on the International Shipping (Australian-resident Seafarers) Grants Bill 1995, although I am wondering why a bill which is clearly contested by the opposition is being debated in this place, which is supposed to be dealing with non-controversial legislation. There was a division in the main chamber a short while ago, and we had to close down the Main Committee. That fact indicates that we need to refine the operations of this Committee. Clearly, there is a glitch in the system when this Committee must close down because of a division in the other place. I realise that this problem will be one of the matters looked at by those who will review the operations of the Main Committee as part of the parliamentary process.

         I listened carefully to some of the contributions made by government members and in particular to that by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). It is sad that he clearly has no idea of the major problems confronting shipping around our coastline. Indeed, it is clear that the government is bereft of ideas. We are a maritime nation. We have a very long coastline with many ports and yet, because of mismanagement in the shipping industry and because of unrealistic wages and conditions, we now have a situation where we have almost no coastal shipping and almost no maritime tourist ships. The old days of the

         As we become more concerned about our environment, we ought to recognise that superhighways and railways might well be very good and necessary, but one of the cleanest, most efficient and environmentally sensible ways of conveying goods around our coastline is through use of the shipping industry. It is a tragedy that most of the Australian shipping industry seems to have died this century. It is non-competitive. ANL is essentially on its last legs and the government ought to rethink the whole problem because it is an important area. It is in the national interest. The bill before the House does very little to solve the difficulties that I have outlined.

         When one looks at the explanatory memorandum to the bill, one is given a misleading indication of what the bill is supposed to be about. The honourable member for Hume pointed out that the bill is all about a union deal. It is all about the arrangements that were made with the maritime unions on 13 September 1994. It is a bribe on the government's part to bring to an end the national maritime strike over the privatisation of ANL. That strike went for a number of days, tens of millions of dollars were lost, the government capitulated and the result is the bill currently before the chamber.

A couple of days ago in the House we heard about a meeting involving the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Mr Solomon Lew and Mr Lindsay Fox. Of course, the Prime Minister did not come clean and tell us what that deal was about. We do not really know. Ultimately, we will find out.

         Sadly, the government has rejected a number of recommendations in the Taylor report on reform of the industry. One of those rejected recommendations related to the establishment of a second register of Australian-owned vessels which will be permitted to use foreign crews. In other words, the future of shipping is not very different from its uncompetitive past, slowly sinking under an Australian flag with Australian crews and Australian award conditions. The government will effectively increase the subsidy for international shipping by providing new tax breaks on crew wages and depreciation.

         The government has made a lot of air play of reduction in crewing levels. I concede that there have been some reductions in crewing levels. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) mentioned before that some Australian ships have fewer members of the crew than some overseas ships. He cited the Norwegian example. No-one could deny that Norway is a very efficient shipping nation. Part of the problem is not the number of crew members on a particular ship but rather what they do when they are there. At the present time I am told that crew levels and costs could be tolerated if the crews would perform the same tasks as crews on rival lines. I would like to quote from the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Bulletin
         </emphasis>
         of 6 June 1995 which stated:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In particular, Australian crews do not carry out maintenance, such as overhauling engines and scraping off rust while the ship is operating. This means that an ANL ship will spend more time in dry dock than one from a rival line.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Of course you do not need to be a mental genius to appreciate that, when we have that kind of hiccup in the system, ANL is simply not going to be as competitive as overseas shipping lines. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cost—both directly and in lost business—could run to an extra $1 million . . . for each ANL ship, putting the line at a heavy disadvantage even without considering the customers it loses because services are curtailed. The lack of . . . ongoing maintenance also means that the life of an ANL ship is about 15 years, whereas rivals can stretch theirs to 25 or 30 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one looks at the capital cost of shipping in Australia, it is clearly a major commercial benefit if an overseas shipping line is able to extend the life of its vessels from 15 years to 25 or 30 years. It is interesting to note the next point:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The actual crew wages only amount to about 3% of ANL's total operating costs, but these other factors blow out to about 9% and really start to wound the line. The cost of the crews is less important than the fact that they don't do enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        Japan provides another instance. Some of their manning levels are actually more than the manning levels on Australian ships but those extra people are used to keep the ship shipshape, they are used for ongoing maintenance, they are used in many other ways, whereas I do not know what some of our people on ships do. I do not know whether they play volleyball or whatever. The simple fact of the matter is that we might have fewer people but they do less than overseas seafarers would do, and the result is that Australian shipping is yet again uncompetitive.

         It is unfortunate that the government is coming into the parliament again to seek up to $59 million of taxpayers' money to be given to the shipping industry over the next five years. It has been pointed out that the seafarers will not receive any of this money, and I concede that, but the bottom line is that the taxpayer is funding this. It is another prop-up to an industry which has allowed itself, through varying causes—partly its own and partly other factors—to be uncompetitive.

         The incentive which the government is seeking to have implemented through this legislation is a taxable grant payable to the employers of Australian seafarers on Australian operated ships engaged in international trade. The amount of the grant would be equal to the notional tax payable on the earnings of seafarers serving on that ship. To qualify, a ship must be Australian operated, its crews must be employed by an Australian employer and the ship must spend not less than half its operational service during the year on international voyages. It is interesting to note that some shipping lines are already changing their schedules to try to take advantage of the particular benefits for them included in this legislation.

         At present, we have about 30 Australian operated ships engaged in international trade and the grant in the first year will be approximately $19 million. The grants are taxable, so that about one-third can be expected to be recouped in 1997-98 because corporation tax payments are lagged by a year. The after-tax impact for each additional ship entering the international trade would be about $400,000 per year. If one ship enters the trade each year, the net impact after tax would be $59 million over the five years to 30 June 2000. I mentioned that if it was possible—and I believe it is possible—to have crews on Australian ships doing the variety of work that crews do on ships operating in other countries, we would achieve a benefit of $1 million per ship. Clearly, if that could be attained, it would not be necessary to bring in this legislation which hands a benefit of about $400,000 with respect to each ship involved in international trade.

         If nothing else, the way that the government, and particularly the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has dealt with the whole issue of ANL has been an interesting saga—and a sad and sorry one. The government is in the grips of a massive asset sale program and has been in that position for a number of years. It has not achieved a great deal of success as far as asset reduction is concerned. This bill we are dealing with has a very clear and definite impact on the government's asset sale campaign, particularly with regard to the sale of ANL. It was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 9 May 1995 when the government was in the process of attempting to negotiate the sale of ANL after the Minister for Transport had made his infamous announcement that `you couldn't give it away'. Subsequently, the government flogged off the most profitable part of the ANL group, which was the stevedoring section.

        That is what this bill that we are debating today is all about: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for mariners. Who foots that bill? Who covers the cost that the government is asking us all to commit to today? It is the taxpayers of Australia. The taxpayers of Australia have absolutely been bled dry by the mismanagement of ANL.

         At the same time, and in the same article, we saw that the minister spent almost $1 million of taxpayers' funds on the you-beaut pair of whiz-kids—the mates—that are supposedly getting ANL out of the mire. They have achieved nothing. The value has gone down. We have not seen a sale. They—that is, one Mr Turnbull and one Mr Wran—have been paid their almost $1 million retainer. They have been paid almost $1 million of taxpayers' money to try and salvage ANL, to get it up and running so that we can sell it and get some profit for Australia for the Australian taxpayers.

         When you dig into it a little deeper, what is the money really being spent on? The money is really being spent on the arrangement that was made with the unions earlier this year. In September 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), senior cabinet ministers, the ACTU and the Maritime Union met to negotiate an industry reform package. As a result of those negotiations, Treasurer Willis announced via a press release on 9 May 1995 that the government had agreed to the introduction of a taxable outlays grant—taxable in the hands of the companies, so that there is company tax payable on it—to be paid to owners and operators of Australian-registered ships predominantly engaged in international trade, to offset the impact on owners and operators of personal income tax on the earnings of seafarers on Australia's eligible international trading ships. The grant is to be administered by the Department of Transport. Subsidising the PAYE tax that is paid by members of the Maritime Union of Australia is what it is all about.

         The bill goes on to talk about eligibility but, interestingly enough, Australian flag shipping carries only four per cent of Australia's foreign trade, and ANL is not the major carrier of this portion. We are supposedly providing a subsidy, and it is interesting to look at this in terms of the overall public policy direction in which the government is going, as far as subsidies and tariff protection for Australian industry are concerned. Everybody else in this country has had the barriers in front of them torn down by this government. There is no protection. `Get out there on the world stage and become world competitive: no protection for you!' Australia, as a nation in the international marketplace, has led the way in tariff and subsidy reduction, ahead of any signing of the Uruguay Round.

         I noted in some of the information I researched to speak on this bill that the Uruguay Round on free trade and `detariffication' did not get to international transport or international shipping. That was left out. That is all well and good, but this Labor government of Australia has hurtled down the path of `detariffication', pulling down those barriers which are protective walls for a lot of Australian industry. Australian industry has been told, `You get out there and compete and become world competitive!' Here today, we are heading back in the other direction by providing assistance and a subsidy, in a roundabout fashion.

         All the commentary on the bill says that it is supposed to make our shipping lines more world competitive. But does not that beg the question of why our shipping lines are not world competitive? Everywhere else, we are expected to be world competitive without any assistance, subsidy or tariffs. Why are they not world competitive? The taxpayers of Australia need to ask that question. The bill is born out of a deal with the Maritime Union of Australia, whereby Minister Brereton wanted things to go along quietly while he was trying to sort out his unbelievable mess with the Australian National Line.

         As a buy-off as far as that union was concerned, the minister said he was going to provide a subsidy, supposedly to international shipping. But it is all about keeping the union happy, because that is where it is ending up. It is going to the companies, but it is ending up back with the unions. Fair enough! But let us be fair about the whole thing. We say to our primary producers and manufacturing industries, `Get out there and compete on the world stage, without any assistance from this government.' This is one of the reasons that our primary industries cannot compete: they have had their hands tied by the lack of true micro-economic reform as far as the transport industry is concerned.

         We have seen the decisions that this government has made as far as tearing down those tariff barriers and subsidy mechanisms is concerned. In its haste to be one of the gang and one of the big players on the world market as far as free trade is concerned, Australia has led the way. We have pulled down our tariff levels and then we have gone off and signed up in the Uruguay Round of the GATT to reduce them by a percentage each year, starting from a lower base than everybody else is on. I am yet to be convinced that, in that area, we are ever going to end up on a footing level with some of our competitors around the world, because we are starting low and coming down, while they are starting up high.

         The most salient point is that we are telling all our other industries in Australia to go out and become more efficient, to become more effective, to become better producers and to compete on the world stage, yet we are not asking this industry to compete. We are not asking this industry to have a close look at itself and ask itself why it cannot compete. What are we doing? We are providing the industry with a subsidy which is going to end up back at the level that I spoke of earlier, on the premise that it is going to make this industry more world competitive. Do you know what? It will not. It will not work. It never has. And it never will work, for the same reasons that we have had to make all our primary industries, all our manufacturing industries, cut the fat, get rid of the fat, have a close look at their process and work out why they really are not competitive.

         It did not work there and now those industries are competing, not because of anything the government has done but because they have had a long, hard look at their process and they have found ways and means to become more world competitive. There is a long way to go in that area, where a future government might be able to help them. But this measure by this government will not go anywhere near helping the shipping lines become more world competitive. Of course some of the industry organisations are going to agree. They are getting a handout. That has never helped anybody get off their butt and go and compete and make themselves productive and efficient. It just will not work. History will prove this government wrong in putting this bill before the parliament today and asking us to sign off on it.

It is heading in the opposite direction from what this government is expecting of most other industries in this country. On that basis we are going to oppose it. As I say, history will record that this government is heading in the wrong direction and that this sort of measure will not achieve what it is designed to do in helping the shipping industry to be more competitive. The government knows where it has to head to to make Australian shipping more competitive and this is not that direction. I think that it is important that these comments be recorded and that the government be made aware that, as I said before, it is not fooling the people in the press gallery, it is not fooling the people that are informing the people of Australia on what is going on.

         I will just repeat the comments of Laura Tingle, because I think they are just a classic. I used this in a speech when we were debating the ANL Sale Bill a couple of weeks ago. I do not know that Laura Tingle is really a great fan of the coalition either, but her headline was, `Labor's behaviour in flogging our shipping line has been disgraceful.' In part of that article she said, `The deal had another price: an ongoing $20 million a year support bill for local mariners.' That puts it in a nutshell. It is nothing to do with making Australian shipping more competitive. It is a $20 million a year support bill for local mariners, and it is a disgrace. As she said, the behaviour of the Labor Party in flogging the Australian shipping line has been disgraceful. The coalition will oppose this bill.

I was parliamentary secretary to the minister for transport some years ago and I think the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) was then the shadow minister. He is still the shadow minister and I do not think he has learnt a great deal over that time. What I am astounded by is his absolute lack of regard for the reforms that have already taken place in the Australian shipping industry, which seem to be ignored totally by the opposition, and the rather gratuitous advice they seem to be giving the Australian community about the way in which the shipping industry is performing.

         It is worth contemplating, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) outlined in the second reading speech, just one aspect of the reform process which has taken place. In 1983 a typical Australian trading ship had a crew of 33. The opposition would have us believe that nothing has changed since 1983. Has something changed? Has it or has it not? Have we improved the crew rates on Australian flag vessels? Simple answer, yes or no. Answer—yes.

         We will not hear of opposition members saying to the community that the reform measures activated by this government—not by a coalition government—have not had a dramatic impact on crew rates. When the coalition was in government before 1983 and when we came into government in that year the figure was 33. What is it today? Do you know the answer? Eighteen. Do you think that is some improvement? Do you think it might be just a marginal improvement, or do you think it is a dramatic improvement?

Opposition members know that is not true. If there is a benefit, it goes to the shipowners. Listening to opposition members, one would think it was going just to ANL.

If it is not the waterfront, it is the shipping industry we continue to hear about, which amazes me. We hear opposition members saying there have not been adequate reforms on the waterfront, that we have not improved our competitiveness, that this is not a legitimate process in micro-economic reform.

Consistent with the NFPS, the Commonwealth has committed significant resources to the accelerated development of regional forest agreements (RFAs) to be signed by the Commonwealth and each State, identifying areas to be managed for conservation reserves, and areas for timber harvesting.

        The four major oil companies—Shell, Mobil, BP and Australian Petroleum—are currently subject to prices surveillance by the Government's independent pricing body, the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA), in relation to the supply of petrol and automotive distillate. Surveillance is applied by means of wholesale price caps for sales of petrol and distillate direct to resellers and distributors set by reference to import parity prices. Under what is known as the intervention pricing system, a `landed' cost for fuel is calculated based on import parity prices of bulk ex-refinery petrol and distillate from Singapore. Prices there closely reflect those in other major world petroleum product markets and it is the main source of imports into Australia. The Singapore product prices are adjusted to become import parity or landed prices by the addition of freight from Singapore, wharfage costs in Australia and insurance. As product and freight costs are quoted in US dollars, the value of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the US dollar has an effect in the calculations. Intervention prices for petrol and automotive distillate are calculated daily, based on a seven day rolling average of the latest available Singapore prices.

        In the absence of the existing prices surveillance arrangements, the extent to which local petrol and distillate prices reflected international prices would be more fully determined by market forces. It appears that imports of petrol and distillate are a close substitute for local production, hence the domestic price of these products would be unlikely to move significantly out of line with international (import) prices provided effective competition exists at the wholesale level. Under the PSA's system, local consumers are protected as they need pay no more than international refinery prices plus
