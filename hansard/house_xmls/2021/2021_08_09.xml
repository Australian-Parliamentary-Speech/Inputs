                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last sitting week I tabled the committee's report on its inquiry into petitioning security and accessibility. During this inquiry, the committee conducted a thorough examination of the security features of the House e-petitions system and considered what impact they had had on the public accessibility of petitioning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also considered whether additional security features, such as the use of official records to verify identity should be implemented, if an age requirement should be imposed on petitioning and whether the current practice of users self-declaring their Australian citizenship or residency was enough to uphold the legitimacy of the petitioning process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the inquiry, the committee were particularly mindful of how any change to the system would impact on a person's democratic right to petition the House, and to ensure that the process for petitioning electronically was, as far as possible, no more onerous than signing or creating a paper petition by hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's final report on the inquiry provides a thorough presentation and analysis of the evidence received, including from some international and domestic jurisdictions that support petitioning. In the report, the committee concluded that any proposed changes to the current system security or processes, beyond routine upgrades, would disadvantage certain cohorts of the community and diminish their right to accessible petitioning. The committee therefore made no recommendations for change, but instead will continue to monitor the current process and conduct reviews as necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Centrelink Age of Independence for Youth Allowance sits at 22. Young Australians can drink, smoke and drive at the age of 18 but are not considered independent. Even students moving out of home to attend university can be denied access to income support based on a parent or partner's income. In the higher education sector, the global pandemic has meant that students are more vulnerable and poorer than ever before. Students are the victims of the casual workforce, penalty rate cuts and the shutdown of industries predominantly worked in by young people due to COVID-19. With funding provided by Universities drying up and the Federal Government income support being reconsidered, anyone can see the impending impact on young people.</span>

We need to fund our future.</span>

That our basic fundemental freedoms to speak about our faith is being repremanded and vilified not only in the media but also in institutions and workplaces.

We believe that Christian entities should have the ability to keep our Christian morals, values and ethics and overall ethos in respect to our Christian organisations and businesses. To continually be true to the Bibles words and to state them both privately and publicly and in a respectful manner. The words of the Bible have been the core foundation to our belief system that has existed for thousands of years, which is a right of every individual to aggregate their own belief systems and follow it. We therefore request that the rights of Christians to speak words of the Bible and pray for others in both private and public spaces be permitted and not be discriminated against, seen as derogatory or hate speech. Australia represents equal rights and a democratic society; therefore we ask for our equal right to be able to live our faith without prejudice or bigoting.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Soil is a complex and diverse ecosystem filled with living organisms from a diverse range of species, providing a crucial resource for the Earth's ecosystem and anthropic needs of primary food production. These anthropogenic activities are evident globally, particularly within the agricultural sector. The inherent nature of mass-scale intensive cropping systems has favoured poor soil management relying on synthetic external inputs. These activities have left humanity in a precarious position as the soil is ill-equipped to deal with the changing environment. Climate change is the greatest existential threat presently posed to Australia; increased variance of climatic conditions, particularly rainfall, will compound challenges on the driest continent on Earth. Current agricultural practices are not conducive to a sustainable future, particularly in a time of increasing unpredictability. Regenerative agriculture is a farming process that rejuvenates the health of the soil, increasing resilience to all climate stresses without the need for chemicals and damaging practices </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to to implement: (1) Nationwide education program targeting primary producers and consumers utilising positive storytelling of successful regenerative enterprises. (2) Mandate distribution of literature at rural stores with every pesticide/herbicide sale. (3) Updated best practice guides focusing on soil health. (4) Creation of regenerative agriculture certification to assist businesses supporting sustainable vendors. We believe these measures will assist in the paradigm switch needed to correct an outdated way of thinking. These measures will cost the Government very little to implement but will increase climatic and economic resilience exponentially. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In the same way that citizens expect providers of electricity and road access to be able to license the necessary infrastructure affordably, we now expect spectrum to be priced to allow internet access to all of us - we cannot have one government body defining an area as rural, and another defining an area as metro, when they are defining access to the same service.</span>

For example, peer pressure and social norms are some risk factors our organisation would like to address.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(1) They violate freedom of choice and bodily autonomy. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">(1) COVID-19 vaccines can cause severe side effects or death. Creating an environment where people feel pressured to be inoculated is extremely immoral.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(2) COVID-19 vaccines are not well understood, especially the side effects and who can be impacted by them. (This was demonstrated by blood clotting in some young people as a result of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.) As such, creating an environment where people feel pressured to be inoculated is tantamount to scientific experimentation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(3) COVID-19 vaccines may cause infertility and cancer. (This was not ruled out by studies.) As such, creating an environment where people feel pressured to be inoculated could have catastrophic implications for our general population. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(4) COVID-19 vaccines make people up to eight times more susceptible to other variants of the virus. (This was proven by a recent study in Israel.) As such, creating an environment where people feel pressured to be inoculated is tantamount to harm. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly: Vaccine passports are NOT based in science. If they were, the World Health Organisation would not have dissuaded nations from using them (Feb 5, 2020).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian citizens and PR are unable to travel internationally to be reunited with their fiancées/de facto partners as they are not classed as 'immediate family'. The connection between partners is equally as important to migrants as it is to couples living in Australia. Australians and PR have not seen their overseas partners for more than a year due to the travel ban and a strict exemption criteria which prevents Prospective Marriage Visa holders (Subclass 300) from obtaining exemptions unless they present a 'compelling reason'. COVID-19 has impacted many Australians, however, being apart from their partners for an extended period of time without an indication of when they will be reunited puts unrealistic expectations on those desperate to see their main support system. This has had a profound impact, mental health has significantly declined, people have had to give up work due to limited support. Majority of Citizens and PR have jobs and study commitments which mean they cannot leave the country for 3 months or more. </span>

Thousands had hardly spent a few days on that visa and the rest of the visa duration is just getting wasted. Hundreds of people in this subclass have their visas expired and hundreds of others are on the verge of expiration. when the subclass category is same, the visa fees paid by both the new as well as the old visa holders is same, then being in the same subclass why is this discrimination done between the new and the old ones. Also recently Australian government has announced that sponsored parents (temporary ) visas will also be provided with an extension of 18 months.

Since the pandemic i am now on the verge of potentially losing my livelihood. Something i have worked for all my life. Laser Clinics Australia and a lot of other clinics that operate, operate under extremely strict OHS standards. We have Drs and nurses that work for us and we abide by the strictest of standards. We wear masks, gloves and make sure our clients are protected and do the right thing by scanning the qr codes and wear masks we have hand sanitiser everywhere. We control the amount of people in the clinic by appointment. We need your financial support as Melbourne Metro Clinics are doing it tough. It is not our decision to close , we are constantly forced to shut. With no money coming in and constant money going out we are not surviving. We have no more support form our landlords under The Covid relief support on rent has now ended, allowing landlords to charge full price with penalties. We, I cannot sustain this any longer.

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 28 May 2021, the Australian Government closed its Embassy in Kabul ahead of its final troop withdrawal. There was no bipartisan consultation on this important decision that has a direct negative impact on Australia's ability to deliver and monitor our ongoing development partnership with Afghanistan. The Embassy's closure has also diminished our Nation's reputation as a reliable strategic partner. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout two decades of war, Afghan citizens worked as contractors for the Australian Defence Force and other Australian agencies. They provided mission essential services and put their own lives, and that of their families, at extreme risk. They sacrificed their safety to protect Australian troops conducting operations in Afghanistan. They wore the Australian uniform in battle; they protected Australian assets and were directly targeted as a result. They gave their lives for the pursuit of "freedom" and "democracy" - ideals that our Government and its coalition partners promised them. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The impact of abandoning those Afghans who gave their loyalty, trust and friendship to Australia and its people, also has the potential to exacerbate existing traumas among Defence and Veterans. Many who may feel deeply troubled by the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and the fate and betrayal of their 'brothers-in-arms'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to act with expediency to uphold that the Australian government has both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative to offer safe haven to those Afghans and their families who face imminent danger of being persecuted because of their direct support to Australia.

              <span class="HPS-Small">For more than half a century the Myanmar military has  oppressed the peoples of Myanmar, stifled their efforts to establish federal democracy, and violated human rights against them with impunity.

However, on 25 April 2021, the Australian government announced that it would provide A$5 million to the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) for the  provision of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar. Australian Aid will flow directly to AHA Centre's counterpart in Myanmar, the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, currently under the Junta's control.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Data contained within the report also demonstrated that 85.4% of people have had no positive impact from the 'trial', an increase of 8.4% since the 2017 Orima report. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This, along with data demonstrating no substantive improvement in any targeted behaviors and a significant decline in participant well being (71% worse off) unequivocally demonstrates that the Cashless Debit Card policy trial had failed to meet its legislated 'trial objectives' as set down by the Australian government. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">It is the basic right of every citizen to choose the methods of attaining good health and therefore avoid illness including Covid 19. Some may not choose the vaccination method and those people would be adversely affected if a "Vaccination Passport" were to be introduced in Australia. To describe vaccination and by extension, the passport as non-compulsory is a misnomer because it would be necessary for access to most services and facilities in society. Included in the list could be banking, travel, supermarkets, sport, medical and social events etc. It would become a License to Live and has no place in a free society. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: At the National Constitutional Convention in May 2017, 250 representatives of First Nations People from across Australia, who were selected after an extensive nationwide series of consultative meetings, gathered at Uluru. Following a process whereby they reached consensus, on May 261h2017 they issued the Statement from the Heart. • They called for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Australian Constitution • They sought a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations • They called for a process of truth-telling about their history to begin to right the wrongs visited upon them for over two centuries </span>

To our shame the Government continues to pay Papua New Guinea and Nauru - at the extraordinary annual cost of $4mil. per person - to keep asylum seekers in conditions that have been plagued for over seven years by physical violence (including murder), sexual abuse of women and children, allegations of torture by guards, medical neglect leading to death, and high rates of mental health decline, self harm and suicide attempts. As stop must now be brought to this extremely expensive, inhumane treatment of innocent people seeking safety in our country. We must do better than this. </span>

As Bwgcolman Traditional Owners, and under the United Nations Rights of Indigenous people we maintain our sovereign autonomy to protest any peoples, organisation or process that we believe is detrimental to Bwgcolman people's cultural, spiritual, social and emotional wellbeing and self-determination. We therefore protest the current and proposed Museum of Underwater Arts Stage (MOUA) 2 Underwater Installations (funded by the Commonwealth 'Building Better Regions Fund') of which the MOUA have submitted application for approval to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Despite our calls for meaningful consultation since 2019, the MOUA Board have not engaged with, informed, or consulted the Bwgcolman people in any acceptable manner. We do not agree with MOUA art installations in any capacity within the waters of Great Palm Island and surrounding island groups.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current "one size fits all" model of service provision for the School Nutrition Program (SNP) does not take into account the disadvantage and inherent issues in very remote Australia. Smaller service providers are expected to manage Federal costs through collection of revenue on the Commonwealth's behalf. Where communities suffer disadvantage moving costs of service provision (e.g. food in the case of the SNP) to parents or carers means that services are lost as is the current case in Laramba. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter to the former Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters, Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, dated 19 October 2020, referring to petition number EN1719. As Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters, I am responding to the Committee's request.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition, which requests a Royal Commission into political donations, with particular regard to what the petitioners describe as 'harmful industries'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians enjoy the freedom to engage in democratic discourse that is consistent with the implied freedom of political communication under the Australian Constitution. Participation in a free democracy includes the right for Australians financially support candidates and parties of their choice through donations.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring transparency and integrity within the electoral system. In 2018, changes to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> (Electoral Act) banned foreign donations and extended financial disclosure obligations beyond political parties and candidates, to also capture other political actors that incur significant political expenditure. We have also invested in enhancements to the Transparency Register run by the Australian Electoral Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recent years, successful reforms to Australia's electoral system have followed work conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM). The Committee is currently reviewing the 2018 changes to the Act and will consider any recommendations from that review after the JSCEM reports on 31 May 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, the Government does not support the petition's request. Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 15 February 2021, concerning petition number EN2138 to the House of Representatives, relating to the child support scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family breakdowns are incredibly difficult. Child support is in place to ensure that as far as possible, children affected by a family breakdown remain financially secure no matter the custody arrangements. The purpose of the scheme is to facilitate the assessment and collection of child support between separated parents, to assist them in meeting their legal obligation to financially support their children until they reach 18 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The scheme and the legislation do not make any distinction based on the gender or background of either a paying parent or a receiving parent. The child support scheme is intended to be fair for both parents, so they can manage their financial responsibilities towards their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested in the following information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Child support formula</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current child support formula was introduced in 2008 using extensive research undertaken by the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support on the costs of caring for children in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Various figures and thresholds in the child support formula, including the Costs of the Children Table and the self-support amount, are benchmarked or indexed using Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE), as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These figures and thresholds are adjusted each year in line with MTAWE, which helps to ensure the formula keeps pace with changes in earnings and the cost of living.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Use of gross income</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Adjusted taxable income, rather than net or gross income, is used in the child support formula to calculate both parents' incomes. The effect of taxation is taken into account under the child support formula as the same approach is used for both income and expenditure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child support assessments are generally based on parents' adjusted taxable income for the last relevant financial year. This is generally the most up-to-date and accurate income information available to Services Australia, and best reflects the parents' true capacity to support their children. This income comprises taxable income (that is, income before tax but after any allowable deductions) and certain supplementary amounts such as foreign income, reportable fringe benefits, tax-free pensions and benefits, total net investment losses and reportable superannuation contributions. The inclusion of supplementary amounts ensures child support liabilities are calculated according to a parent's capacity to provide support for their child, regardless of how their income is structured.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;" />
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Superannuation contributions</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As explained above, adjusted taxable income includes supplementary amounts such as reportable superannuation contributions. Reportable superannuation contributions include discretionary salary-sacrificed superannuation contributions an employee has made in addition to their compulsory superannuation payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reportable superannuation contributions are treated in the same way as wage and salary income because those contributions could have been received as cash. In most circumstances, choosing to invest additional amounts into superannuation is a way of legitimately reducing a person's taxable income. While these arrangements are legitimate for taxation purposes, they should not diminish a parent's fundamental responsibility to support their child in line with their financial capacity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Compulsory superannuation payments, such as amounts made under superannuation guarantee law or according to an industrial award or agreement, are generally not considered reportable superannuation contributions and are therefore not part of a parent's child support income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">

                <span style="font-weight:bold;">Enforcement of child support debt</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The effective enforcement of child support obligations is central to the integrity of the child support scheme. Some parents will choose not to make voluntary child support payments, and may be subject to enforcement measures to ensure child support is still collected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the first instance, Services Australia encourages parents who are behind in their child support payments to enter into a voluntary payment arrangement, to address their debt in the shortest possible time. A payment arrangement will take into account the parent's individual financial circumstances, and Services Australia can periodically review the arrangement to ensure it still reflects the parent's current financial circumstances. Services Australia has extensive enforcement powers, including the ability to directly garnishee wages, recover funds from bank accounts, tax returns or certain income support payments, and the power to prevent child support defaulters from travelling overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, Services Australia also has the ability to take litigation action through a court. This option is always given careful consideration prior to action being undertaken.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia's compliance approach balances education, support, advice and enforcement activities. Enforcement powers also apply equally to both paying and receiving parents, and can be used to collect carer debts as well as child support debts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System is conducting a wide-ranging Inquiry to ensure that the system operates as fairly and efficiently as possible. It is also looking at how the family law system interacts with child support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Announced by the Government in September 2019, this Inquiry has provided an important opportunity for parliamentarians to hear from people who have interacted with the system. The Joint Select Committee will report by November 2021. More information is available at</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 16 March 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, providing petition EN2336 regarding changing the date of Australia Day. As the Minister responsible for the National Australia Day Council, the Prime Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf and I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I respectfully disagree with the sentiment of the petition that we need to change the date of Australia Day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia Day is a day to reflect on our shared history, its highs and its lows, to respect the stories of others and celebrate our nation, its achievements, but most of all its people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It's a time to reflect on the past 60,000 years of Australian history, our many successes, and our failures, and to be grateful for the free and fair democracy we have created for ourselves today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On Australia Day we welcome our newest Australians alongside the world's oldest living culture and celebrate our diverse background, and the extraordinary achievements that have made Australia a successful multicultural society.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, 26 January means different things to different people, particularly Indigenous Australians. The fact there is discussion around the date means it is an important date. The reason that 26 January means so much in different ways to different people needs to be harnessed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We can improve the way we celebrate Australia Day by being more respectful and inclusive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It's important that we reflect on Australia Day on the impact European settlement had on Indigenous Australians and their way of life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We must and we should include greater recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's history, traditions and culture. There are important opportunities to tell truth and learn from it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example, in Yirrkala in the Northern Territory, Yolngu and Balanda, Aboriginal and non­Aboriginal came together to celebrate Australia Day 2021 as one community. Over 500 people, coming together to the Buku Larrnggay Mulka centre in a COVID-safe way, for a Welcome to Country, smoking ceremony and Bungul.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Sydney, Australia Day 2021 started with the WugulOra Morning Ceremony at Barangaroo - WugulOra means 'One Mob' and has been a part of Sydney's Australia Day activities for years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Perth, the afternoon of Australia Day 2021 featured the Birak Festival, followed by a light show telling the story of Noongar and Whadjuk people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We can and we are doing Australia Day better. But there's always more that we can do. As Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM MP, put it: "It is also a journey that for some is difficult, it is raw, and it does hurt in parts - but rather than shy away from this, or dismiss our success, we should come together as one this Australia Day and reach out to better understand the Australian story of others."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Linda Burney MP, agrees: "What I'm saying to Australians this Australia Day is, we don't need to change the date, we just need to change the way we observe the day. Take just a moment to learn about our past. Australia is home to the oldest surviving civilisation - more than 60,000 years - on Earth. This is and ought to be a source of pride for all Australians."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is why we need to focus on honouring our national day more respectfully, more inclusively, so Australia Day can be a day about bringing Australians together as one, not dividing us - because we are all part of the Australian story.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Australia Day Council has been asking Australians to do just that — to reflect, respect and celebrate and recognise that we are all part of the Story of Australia. This message was borne out of a desire to make Australia Day more inclusive of the histories, stories and contributions of all Australians, but especially First Nations people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National Australia Day Council Director and Walbanga and Wadi Wadi woman, Mrs Alison Page, encouraged all Australians to explore their history together on Australia Day in her opinion piece published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> on 26 January 2021.</span>

The fact there is discussion around the date means it is an important date. The reason that 26 January means so much in different ways to different people needs to be harnessed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We can improve the way we celebrate Australia Day by being more respectful and inclusive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It's important that we reflect on Australia Day on the impact European settlement had on Indigenous Australians and their way of life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We must and we should include greater recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's history, traditions and culture. There are important opportunities to tell truth and learn from it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For example, in Yirrkala in the Northern Territory, Yolngu and Balanda, Aboriginal and non­Aboriginal came together to celebrate Australia Day 2021 as one community. Over 500 people, coming together to the Buku Larrnggay Mulka centre in a COVID-safe way, for a Welcome to Country, smoking ceremony and Bungul.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Sydney, Australia Day 2021 started with the WugulOra Morning Ceremony at Barangaroo - WugulOra means 'One Mob' and has been a part of Sydney's Australia Day activities for years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Perth, the afternoon of Australia Day 2021 featured the Birak Festival, followed by a light show telling the story of Noongar and Whadjuk people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We can and we are doing Australia Day better. But there's always more that we can do. As Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM MP, put it: "It is also a journey that for some is difficult, it is raw, and it does hurt in parts - but rather than shy away from this, or dismiss our success, we should come together as one this Australia Day and reach out to better understand the Australian story of others."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Linda Burney MP, agrees: "What I'm saying to Australians this Australia Day is, we don't need to change the date, we just need to change the way we observe the day. Take just a moment to learn about our past. Australia is home to the oldest surviving civilisation - more than 60,000 years - on Earth. This is and ought to be a source of pride for all Australians."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is why we need to focus on honouring our national day more respectfully, more inclusively, so Australia Day can be a day about bringing Australians together as one, not dividing us - because we are all part of the Australian story.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Australia Day Council has been asking Australians to do just that — to reflect, respect and celebrate and recognise that we are all part of the Story of Australia. This message was borne out of a desire to make Australia Day more inclusive of the histories, stories and contributions of all Australians, but especially First Nations people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National Australia Day Council Director and Walbanga and Wadi Wadi woman, Mrs Alison Page, encouraged all Australians to explore their history together on Australia Day in her opinion piece published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> on 26 January 2021.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 March 2021 to the former Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Christian Porter MP, concerning the House of Representatives Petition EN2367 calling for the Australian Government to immediately cease breaching international human rights law and local Australian law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a party to a number of United Nations treaties that protect human rights which are implemented through a range of laws, policies and programs at the federal and state and territory levels. The Government considers that Australia's laws and policies are consistent with the obligations in these instruments. The Government is committed to eliminating discrimination against women. The federal <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984</span> makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, breastfeeding and family responsibilities in certain areas of public life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes that the family law system plays an important role in helping to identify families at risk and protect them from harm. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975</span> does not contain any presumptions in relation to gender.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian system of government is based on a separation of powers between the Legislature (the Parliament), the Executive (the Government), and the Judiciary (the Courts). It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free of interference from the executive arm of government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is well served by its judiciary, and allegations about judicial conduct that warrant consideration of removal of a judge from office are extremely rare. However, where required, complaints about the conduct of a judicial officer that may warrant their removal from office are considered by the Parliament under section 72(ii) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Constitution</span>. Proved misbehaviour or incapacity is required in order for this to occur. Ordinarily it is the federal courts who are responsible for the handling of complaints, consistent with their independence. The complaints and feedback processes for the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court are published on the Court's own website.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 22 March 2021 requesting consideration of a petition before the Standing Committee on Petitions for 15 October to be recognised as the annual International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that the loss of a child is a traumatic event that can have long lasting consequences for women and their families. We are committed to reducing stillbirth rates and are investing in a range of measures to achieve this. Our investment in perinatal services and support to date totals $162.3 million. This includes $21.3 million for stillbirth specific measures, such as funding to support stillbirth education and awareness initiatives particularly for groups at higher risk of stillbirth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2021-22 Budget, we announced a new investment of $1.8 million over four years to help increase the number of stillbirth autopsies to better understand the reasons underlying these tragic deaths. This investment will support our goal to reduce stillbirths by 20 per cent or more by December 2025 and will implement actions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We also announced $13.7 million to prevent preterm birth and $47.4 million for universal perinatal mental health screening to build on the National Perinatal Mental Health Check. This will help all expectant parents to access screening services that support improved mental health outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, we provide funding to Red Nose to deliver online and telephone-based bereavement support for miscarriage, stillbirth or newborn death as part of our $43.9 million investment under the Perinatal Mental Health and Wellbeing Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Proclamation of 'days of national observance' by the Governor-General is just one of a number of ways to promote the observation of days of celebration or commemoration. National days of commemoration may be observed without a proclamation or intervention by the Australian Government. Mothers' Day and Red Nose Day are among the many examples of days throughout the year that have gained community acceptance as the dates on which particular events are celebrated or commemorated, without government involvement.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning petition number EN2415, which requests that the advancement of religion be removed as a recognised charitable purpose, as it applies to registration by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), with the effect of removing all charitable tax concessions from religious organisations. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, eligibility for registration with the ACNC and eligibility for charitable tax concessions are interlinked. Charities must be registered with the ACNC to apply for charitable tax concessions from the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To become registered with the ACNC, amongst other criteria, an organisation must be a charity which includes having only charitable purposes. Charitable purpose has a special legal meaning, developed over 400 years by firstly, the United Kingdom, and later Australian, courts and Parliament. The courts have recognised many different charitable purposes, and as society changes new charitable purposes have been recognised. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Charities Act 2013</span>, which defines what is a charity, recognises twelve such purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the charitable purposes listed under the Charities Act is the purpose of advancing religion. Religion has been accepted as a charitable purpose since the 1600s and the current Charities Act is based on this substantial body of case law. Comparable international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand also consider religion a charitable purpose that benefits the community, and provide tax concessions to religious bodies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that organisations with the purpose of advancing religion are eligible for registration with the ACNC provided they meet all the eligibility criteria. Likewise, registered religious charities, in the same way as all other charities, may apply to access charitable tax concessions provided they meet all the eligibility criteria. Organisations with the purpose of advancing religion have the same registration requirements as organisations that have one of many other charitable purposes. The test for charitable purpose is not specifically a religious one.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012</span>, nor the <span style="font-style:italic;">Charities Act 2013</span>, infringe section 116 of the Constitution, as neither Act establishes any religion, imposes any religious observance, prohibits the free exercise of any religion, or introduces a religious test for qualification to any Commonwealth office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2527 - a request for a further extension to the JobKeeper Payment for travel agents and tour operators. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was designed as a national scheme, to apply consistently across a broad range of Australian businesses and industry sectors. As such, the scheme was not intended to apply individual criteria for the Payment to any specific sector or group of businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment was always intended to be a temporary program designed to support confidence and get businesses back up and running as soon as possible. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it achieved its objective of keeping business in business and Australians in jobs. JobKeeper supported nearly half of Australian businesses and one-third of all workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 11 March 2021, in recognition that certain sectors would need additional assistance, the Australian Government announced a further $1.2 billion in targeted support for the tourism and aviation sectors. The package included a mix of half-price airline tickets and direct support to keep planes in the air and aviation workers in jobs. Increasing domestic tourism helps businesses along the supply chain including hotels, cafes and restaurants and tour operators get back to normal trading. Through the Tourism Aviation Network Support (TANS) Program, discount ticket prices are available on more than 45,000 fares per week. Australians are able to access these discount fares to 14 tourism regions particularly hurt by COVID-19 for travel through to the end of September 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also provided an additional $130 million to extend the Consumer Travel Support Program for three months to support travel agents. This brought the total level of targeted assistance to $258 million, to help sustain the travel sector as it supports Australian travellers adjust to COVID-safe travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government appreciates international travel restrictions, passenger caps and quarantine arrangements continue to impact Australia's aviation and tourism sectors. For this reason, we have been working with the New Zealand Government to facilitate quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand to provide a much needed boost to international airline, airport and tourism operators in Australia. From 19 April 2021 visitors between Australia and New Zealand have been able to travel without having to quarantine at either end of their journey. The Government is optimistic that airlines will commence additional services to meet demand generated by the two-way safe travel zone, with benefits anticipated to flow to travel agents as international travel demand increases.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The importance of this announcement is demonstrated by the fact that the Trans-Tasman is Australia's busiest international aviation market with over seven million passengers on the route in the year ending January 2020 before the effects of COVID-19 hit international aviation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also announced an expansion and extension to its existing SME Guarantee Scheme as part of its commitment to support up to $40 billion in lending to small and medium enterprises. The SME Recovery Loan Scheme has benefitted from an increased government guarantee, allowing lenders to offer a repayment holiday of up to 24 months, longer loan terms, larger loan sizes and the ability for borrowers to refinance existing debt.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The vaccine roll-out is also underway, supporting domestic borders to remain open and providing greater certainty for people to travel for both business and leisure purposes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 24 May 2021 regarding petition EN2561, which requests changes to copyright law to introduce a 'use/sell it or lose it' clause.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners' concern that lack of legal access to copyrighted works, particularly older works, harms the preservation of art and culture. The petitioners propose that a published work becomes part of the public domain if it ceases to be reasonably accessible to purchase, use and/or stream digitally for a certain amount of time without reasonable justification. The petitioners consider that, in these circumstances, the public should not have to wait 70 or more years for a work to enter the public domain to legally access the work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Copyright law is essential to incentivising creators, and their industries, to create new and culturally relevant content. At the same time, allowing reasonable access to creative content is critical to enhance culture and learning, and drive new creativity and innovation. In particular, where the copyright owner cannot be identified or contacted (as is often the case with older works), copyright owners, users and society as a whole lose out on the potential benefits that could be gained from using such 'orphaned' material.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Copyright Act 1968</span> (Copyright Act) seeks to balance the rights of copyright owners to manage and protect their works with the larger public interest to access these works. It does this by giving creators the exclusive right to exploit their works for monetary gain for a certain period. For works such as literary and artistic works, this is usually for the life of the author plus 70 years. During this period, copyright owners generally have the right to control how and when their content is accessed. However, the Copyright Act also provides for exceptions that permit access to works for certain socially useful purposes, in particular to support the education, disability and cultural (libraries, archives, museums and galleries) sectors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 August 2020, the Morrison Government announced a package of copyright access reforms, principally to clarify and update the current exceptions. The reforms also propose a new scheme that allows for the use of 'orphan works' (where the copyright owner cannot be identified or contacted) if a reasonably diligent search for the copyright owner has been undertaken, while also providing for reasonable payment to the copyright owner for any ongoing use of the orphan work if the owner later comes forward. The proposed orphan works scheme will open access to a larger collection of cultural, historical and educational works held in Australia's cultural and educational institutions, as well as enabling orphaned copyright material to be used in modem creative endeavours.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention. I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 14 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2564 on financing of aged care in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to transforming aged care so that it meets the needs of senior Australians and their families, now and in the future. We all need to do more to ensure senior Australians are treated with care, dignity and respect and have access to quality care as they age. The Final Report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (Royal Commission), released on 1 March 2021, is an important step in what will be a significant transformation in aged care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has now responded to the Final Report, with a comprehensive aged care reform package announced in the 2021-22 Budget. The Government will deliver a $17.7 billion package for a once in a generation reform of aged care to deliver respect, care and dignity to our senior Australians. The response includes a five-year implementation plan, underpinned by five pillars:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In responding to the 148 recommendations made by the Royal Commission, the Government accepts or accepts in principle 126 recommendations. In addition, the Government supports an alternative approach to another four recommendations, for example where the Commissioners had different views and models on governance and implementation. Twelve recommendations are subject to further consideration or noted in the Government's response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government did not accept six recommendations relating to consumer contributions and fees, including the introduction of a new aged care levy or higher personal income taxation to pay for aged care services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government, together with other governments around the world, has been very consistent in expressing concerns about the imposition of the National Security Law, and is troubled by the law's implications for Hong Kong's judicial independence, and the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The development of electric, hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles is being driven by the world's largest car manufacturers. The number of consumers who choose to buy these vehicles will rapidly increase as these new technologies reach parity with mature alternatives. Australians currently have access to around 50 electric vehicle models, including hybrids, and this is likely to increase as the technology continues to develop.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2020, the Government announced a $1.9 billion package to invest in new energy technologies that will support jobs, strengthen our economy and reduce emissions. This included a Future Fuels Fund that will enable businesses to start integrating new vehicle technologies into their fleets, and address regional blackspots in public charging and refuelling infrastructure.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN1606 which seeks more support for small businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak and a review of Australian competition law. Please accept my sincere apologies for the delay in response. I have received a large number of emails and requests for information and have not been able to respond as quickly as I would like.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that the once-in-a-century shock imposed by COVID-19 warrants an extraordinary level of support across the economy. The Government's Economic Recovery Plan has been designed to support Australian households and businesses through this exceptionally difficult period. It has helped keep businesses in business and Australians in jobs through the JobKeeper Payment and Boosting Cash Flow for Employers, and supported Australians in need with the Coronavirus Supplement and Early Release of Superannuation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's response is now transitioning to ensure the Australian economy recovers strongly by targeting additional temporary support measures to boost household incomes, bring forward business and infrastructure investment activity, and drive the unemployment rate back down. More information is available at: www.budget.gov.au/2020-21/content/covid-19.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government believes effective competition is essential for a strong small business sector, better consumer-outcomes and a strong economy, and it has therefore taken steps to strengthen Australia's competition laws. The first major review of Australia's competition laws and policy in more than 20 years was completed in 2015. This review's finding resulted in major legislative reforms which took effect in November 2017. These reforms strengthened the prohibition on the misuse of market power, prohibited anti-competitive concerted practices, reformed merger approval processes and made a wide range of other improvements to competition law.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 16 June 2021, I released 'A pathway for reforming national environmental law' and an accompanying timeline, that together, outline the Australian Government's staged approach to consider the recommendations of the EPBC Act Review and reform of Australia's national environmental law. These documents will guide the Government as it engages with stakeholders to deliver meaningful and enduring reform in response to the EPBC Act Review.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 19 October 2020 to the Minister for Government Services, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, concerning petition number EN1766. As the matters raised fall within my portfolio responsibilities, your email has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Australian social security system is a taxpayer-funded, non-contributory system based on the concepts of residence and need. The system targets payments to those most in need through the income and assets tests. In this way, successive governments have ensured there are sufficient resources for those with the greatest need. In making spending decisions, the Government has to balance the need to support Australians with the need to maintain the sustainability of the social security system over the long term.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Working age allowances are designed to provide a safety net for people who require financial assistance, while maintaining incentives for people to join the workforce. Depending on their circumstances, recipients may also be eligible for supplementary payments, such as Commonwealth Rent Assistance .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is acting decisively in the national interest to support households and businesses and address the significant economic consequences of coronavirus.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has extended the temporary Coronavirus Supplement until 31 March 2021. The initial rate of the Coronavirus Supplement was set at $550 a fortnight until 24 September 2020. From 25 September 2020 to 31 December 2020, the supplement has been extended and adjusted to $250 a fortnight. From 1 January 2021 to 31 March 2021, the supplement will be $150 a fortnight to reflect the gradually improving economic and labour market conditions .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the extension of the Coronavirus Supplement, a number of temporary measures have also been extended until 31 March 2021. These measures include changes to the personal income test for JobSeeker Payment, and changes to the partner income test for JobSeeker Payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 September 2020, the personal income test for JobSeeker Payment was temporarily changed to a $300 a fortnight income free area, with a 60 cent taper rate for income above the free area. This is an increase to the previous income free areas for JobSeeker Payment. Currently, a single recipient can earn up to $1,257.50 a fortnight before losing access to their payment. This is an increase from the $1,088 a fortnight recipients could earn under the previous arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the temporarily reduced taper rate for the JobSeeker Payment partner income test has been extended until 31 March 2021. Since 25 September 2020, the taper rate has been 27 cents for every dollar of partner income earned over $1,165 a fortnight. This ensures that eligible people with personal income of less than $300 a fortnight can receive JobSeeker Payment and the Coronavirus Supplement provided their partner earns less than $3,086.11 a fortnight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The combination of these measures ensures that extra support is available to Australians who need it most to deal with the economic impacts of COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is closely monitoring the health, economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and will continue to take a measured approach as the situation evolves.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Judicial Appointments</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 19 October 2020 regarding Petition EN1782 on the creation of a more transparent and accountable judicial appointments process. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Appointments of judges to Australia's federal courts are important decisions to which the Australian Government gives careful consideration. Consistent with long standing conventions, each government determines its own process for judicial appointments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the First Law Officer of the Commonwealth, I am responsible for making recommendations to the Government, and ultimately to the Governor-General, about candidates who are suitable for appointment. Before making a recommendation, I have regard to a broad range of factors, including the expertise and background of potential candidates, and consultation with relevant persons. This ensures all judicial appointments are based on merit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to the petitioners' calls for comprehensive security vetting checks for current and future judicial appointments, I note under item C.3.1 to policy 9 of the Australian Government's Protective Security Policy Framework, judges of federal courts are exempt from requiring to hold security clearances for the purpose of accessing security classified information while exercising the duties of their judicial office. This is consistent with recommendation 6-2 of the Australian Law Reform Commission's (ALRC) 2004 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Keeping Secrets: The Protection of Classified and Security Sensitive Information</span> (Report No. 98), which concluded there should be no requirement imposed by the executive government for any judge or magistrate be subject to a security clearance before participating in any case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the ALRC observed, '[t]he idea that the executive government could vet judges or magistrates and select who would sit on a court or in a particular case based on a secret security assessment of some sort closed to public scrutiny strikes at the heart of the notion of the separation of powers - which is central to the Australian Constitution - and at the independence of the judiciary and magistracy.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, regarding the petitioners' calls for reform to the process for appointing judges' associates, I note this is not a process managed by the Government. It is an essential feature of the Australian system of government that our courts are independent and free of interference from the executive arm of government. Consistent with this independence , the federal courts are each absolutely and ultimately responsible for managing all employment matters, including the recruitment of non-statutory appointees such as judges' associates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, concerning Petition EN1789 - zero deposit property loans for farms, which had five signatures.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no legislation requiring banks to seek deposits from prospective borrowers. This is a commercial decision for the lender. A bank will generally require a borrower to provide some level of deposit to reduce its risk in making the loan and meet regulatory requirements to manage its overall risk. The provision of an asset as collateral for a loan may also serve a similar purpose, depending on the nature and value of the loan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Banks have strengthened their lending standards in recent years in response to specific measures taken by regulators to improve lending practices and limit systemic risks. This has coincided with a moderation in lending, particularly to investors and for interest-only loans. However, recent regulatory actions concerning lending policies were designed with the intent to limit risks to the financial system and broader economy, not to unfairly restrict the ability of particular groups of consumers to access credit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of recent anecdotal reports that, given the current level of public scrutiny of their past lending practices, banks have become overly cautious in how they are interpreting the application of existing legal and prudential obligations on their lending. In response, the Treasurer has stated publicly that while banks must adhere to regulatory standards, consideration should also be given to the need to provide access to finance for families and businesses, thus facilitating a critical part of the economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers it important that those consumers and businesses with good credit profiles are able to access the finance they need. Ultimately competition, rather than regulation, is the most effective means of creating customer choice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 19 May 2021, I announced that the Liberal National Government had committed up to $600 million in equity for Snowy Hydro Limited to build a 660 megawatt gas power station at Kurri Kurri in New South Wales. This project will help ensure adequate replacement generation is available once the Liddell power station retires, delivering reliable and affordable electricity for households, businesses and industries in New South Wales.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This project will create up to 600 new local jobs during peak construction and 1,200 indirect jobs across New South Wales, delivering an important economic boost to the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As more renewables enter our energy system, the Government is working to deliver an affordable and reliable grid. The key challenge to supporting continued strong growth in renewable capacity is to provide backup for when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing. Gas, including the Hunter Power Project, will support the strong investment in renewables by firming up intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The Hunter Power Project will also be hydrogen-ready, enabling it to use clean hydrogen in the future as that fuel becomes cost-competitive.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN2156 -Removal of specific duty free limitations on tobacco and alcohol.</span> Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has no plans to remove the specific duty free arrangements that apply to alcohol and tobacco carried by incoming travellers on arrival into Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners specifically highlighted the duty on tobacco as an example. The Government discourages the use of all tobacco products as there is no form of tobacco use which has benign health effects for consumers. Despite the recent decline in the incidence of smoking, it remains a leading cause of preventable death and disability in Australia, with smoking estimated to have killed almost 21,000 Australians in 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organisation identifies price increases through taxation as one of the most effective ways governments can reduce tobacco consumption. Successive Australian governments have made significant efforts in recent years to reduce tobacco consumption through staged increases in tobacco excise and a swap to wage indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The taxation of tobacco products, apart from discouraging smoking, helps to pay for support for people who wish to quit smoking, essential services such as the delivery of health services and other areas of spending that benefit the whole Australian community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 16 February 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, enclosing petition EN2221, which requests the Australian Government cut the Australian Public Service (APS) numbers and wages over $150,000 and move departments to other parts of the country. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Everyone in the Australian Government, from the Prime Minister down, appreciates the outstanding work the APS does, particularly as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 9 April 2020, the Government introduced a six-month pause on wage increases for all APS employees. The Government believes that at that time a temporary deferral of pay increases was suitable as it was inappropriate for APS employees who have jobs to be receiving wage increases while thousands of Australians face significant financial difficulty and unprecedented job losses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The APS is a foundational institution of Australia's democracy. It performs a critical role within the executive arm of Government. Its proper functioning is essential to the future prosperity and security of all Australians and successive governments require the APS to perform efficiently and effectively in order to fulfil their responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the views expressed in the petition relating to removing duplication of functions between the Commonwealth and the States, the Australian federation has a three tier system of government consisting of the Commonwealth, States and Territories and local government. The Australian Constitution specifies the powers and responsibilities of the Commonwealth Parliament and Government. These powers and responsibilities are usually matters of national interest and include trade and commerce with other countries, taxation, postal services and defence. Powers and responsibilities not specified in the Constitution reside with the States and Territories. These include education, transport, law enforcement and health services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">DFAT continues to offer consular assistance to Australians all over the world who have been impacted by COVID-19. The services DFAT can provide are outlined in the Consular Services Charter and include providing Australians with details of local doctors and hospitals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's COVID-19 vaccinations will be rolled out domestically to people within Australia. Australians overseas should consult their local health professional for advice on vaccine options.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate it is difficult to return to Australia and acknowledge that the temporary caps on international passenger arrivals into Australia have been extremely frustrating and upsetting for many Australians seeking to return. The decision to introduce the temporary caps on international passenger arrivals was taken by the National Cabinet to safeguard the Australian community and to ensure there is sufficient quarantine capacity to meet the needs of inbound travellers. Airlines determine how they manage the temporary caps in place and decisions regarding seat allocations for commercial flights rests entirely with airlines and may be driven by business considerations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and Territory governments, with support from the Australian Government including the Department of Health, manage quarantine arrangements. The Government will continue to work with the Northern Territory to operate government facilitated commercial flights using the Howards Springs quarantine facility. The Australian Government will continue to engage with States and Territories flexibly on additional capacity above the caps to assist vulnerable Australians to return.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As at 23 June, over 607,000 Australians have returned to Australia since the Government recommended people reconsider the need to travel abroad. Since the start of the pandemic, DFAT has helped over 48,700 Australians to return, including around 21,000 people on 142 government facilitated flights from destinations including London, Frankfurt, Paris, New Delhi, Chennai, Johannesburg, Santiago, Los Angeles, Vancouver and a number of ports with direct connections through Singapore. This includes 49 facilitated flights from India and 20 flights from the United Kingdom. On 5 March 2021, the Prime Minister announced the Australian Government would continue to support repatriation flights for Australians through to the end of 2021, as required.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope this reassures petitioners of the Government's commitment to assisting Australians overseas.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 3 May 2021 to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Karen Andrews MP concerning petition EN2407 calling for the ban on international travel to be revoked. As my portfolio is responsible for Australia's COVID-19 health response, your letter has be referred to me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 18 March 2020, the Governor-General declared that a human biosecurity emergency exists under section 475 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span> (Biosecurity Act) in relation to the listed human disease 'human coronavirus with pandemic potential' (COVID-19). The existence of a human biosecurity emergency period allows me, as the Health Minister, to determine requirements and give directions under the Act that are necessary to prevent or control the entry, emergence, establishment or spread of COVID-19 in Australian territory or part of Australian territory. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Overseas Travel Ban Emergency Requirements) Determination 2020</span> (Overseas Travel Ban) is one of four emergency Determinations currently in place.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act requires my satisfaction that the emergency requirements are:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">likely to be effective in, or contribute to, achieving its purpose</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">appropriate and adapted to the purpose</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">no more restrictive or intrusive than required in the circumstances</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">are applied in a manner that is no more restrictive or intrusive than required in the circumstances</span>

            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">in place for only as long as necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Overseas Travel Ban moderates the volume of Australians travelling overseas and thus seeking to return home, reducing the risk posed to Australia's quarantine capacity, health systems, and the Australian community, as well as the risks to those individuals who may otherwise be in a country with high COVID-19 prevalence. The Overseas Travel Ban greatly assists the Australian Government's efforts to prevent and control the entry and spread of COVID-19 in Australian territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises citizens and permanent residents may have exceptional circumstances or compelling reasons for needing to leave Australian territory. The exemption process overseen by the Department of Home Affairs ensures that the travel restriction is no more restrictive or intrusive than required in the circumstances of the current global pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee review the emergency period and its response measures, including the Overseas Travel Ban, to ensure ongoing appropriateness and proportionality in terms of global and local epidemiology, including the emergence of more highly transmissible variants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Opening Australia's borders too soon could see a resurgence in cases, undoing progress and placing strain on Australia's healthcare resources and quarantine systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to consider when and how to reopen our borders safely. This is a step-by-step process underpinned by the latest medical advice and based on robust risk assessments. Positively, eligible travellers to New Zealand are exempt from the Overseas Travel Ban, under the quarantine free safe travel arrangements between the Australian and New Zealand Governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although Australia has approved COVID-19 vaccines to prevent development of serious disease if an individual becomes infected, the vaccination program should not be viewed as a panacea or a complete substitute for other public health interventions. All Australians must continue with COVID safe practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There remains insufficient data as to whether the vaccines also prevent vaccinated individuals transmitting the virus to others. A person could be vaccinated but still be able to transmit. Until there is a better understanding of this, the purpose for rolling out vaccination in the short term is to protect individuals from developing disease. It should be assumed, until proven otherwise, that vaccinated individuals remain potentially infectious to others.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2409.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation. It is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines is ongoing, the technologies have been studied for years and used in other treatments without issue. Scientists began creating viral vectors like the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the 1970s, and mRNA vaccines like Pfizer have been studied before for influenza, rabies and for cancer treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Previous research and vaccine rollout demonstrates that severe side effects are extremely rare and, if they if do occur, they usually happen within the first two months. Because of this, scientists and public-health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public. Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have been tested in clinical trials since mid-2020 and ongoing trials continue to gather new data over time. Trial data has shown excellent safety results. The first few months of safety data is required before approving any new vaccines. This, plus information coming from vaccine recipients across the world, provides confidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All vaccines are thoroughly tested to ensure they are effective before approval by the regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), for use in Australia. Through the TGA, Australia also has a robust system for the ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety. The TGA facilitates a responsive and effective review system to detect any unexpected side-effects from COVID-19 vaccines, if they occur, and ensure they are investigated promptly. This type of monitoring is standard practice in Australia for all vaccines, and draws on Australia's medical expert active and vaccine safety system data gathered through AusVaxSafety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The long-term effects of COVID-19 infection are, however, well-documented. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, common lasting symptoms of COVID-19 infection are fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and chest pain. Other issues include cognitive problems, difficulty concentrating, depression, muscle pain, headache, rapid heartbeat and intermittent fever.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 vaccination has not been made mandatory in Australia by the Government and individuals maintain the option to choose. However, it is important that anyone who can receive a vaccination does so, to help keep themselves and others safe. All individuals must give informed consent before having the COVID-19 vaccine, and anyone with questions about the benefits of being vaccinated is encouraged to talk to their doctor or health professional.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some states and territories have now issued public-health orders that require COVID-19 vaccination for people working in certain high-risk workplaces only:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Queensland: From 31 March 2021, COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory for all relevant health service employees, Queensland Ambulance Service employees and contractors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Western Australia: From 10 May 2021, COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory to work in Western Australia's hotel quarantine system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is also possible that in the future, vaccination against COVID-19 might become a requirement for travel to certain destinations, or for people working in certain high-risk workplaces. Where COVID-19 vaccination has been made mandatory, there will be exemptions for people who are unable to be vaccinated for medical and other reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians are encouraged to rely on reputable sources of information to help them make informed choices and stay up-to-date. To this end, my Department has been communicating regularly about the progress, safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, with more information available online at: www.health.gov.au.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 enclosing Petition EN2414 concerning the eligibility requirements of a Remaining Relative (subclass 115) visa application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family migration is an important element of Australia's migration system, allowing Australian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with their family members and contributing to stronger social cohesion outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each year, a consultation process is undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs to hear the community's views and inform the Australian Government on both the size and composition of the annual Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following public consultations, the permanent Migration Program is set with Australia's immediate and longer-term economic and social needs in mind. Australia's permanent Migration Program has had a distribution of two-thirds Skill and one-third Family visas since 2005-06.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2020-21 and 2021-22, in response to the impacts of COVID-19, the proportion of the Family stream increased to approximately half of the total Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The priority in the Family stream category is given to immediate family members who are partner and dependent child applicants. This aligns with the current Government's policy intentions, the need to give priority to certain applications , and to manage the size and composition of the Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Visa places are also available, but to a lesser extent, to parents and other family members. The remaining Relative visa is for applicants who have no 'near relatives' other than their visa sponsor. A 'near relative' includes brothers, sisters, parents (or step-equivalents) and non-dependent adult children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To be eligible for the visa, the person, or their partner, must not have a near relative who lives outside Australia. At present, there is no intention to change these policy settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2414 to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Social Media</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 May 2021, concerning Petition EN2419, calling for new laws to prevent digitals platforms from deleting political content that does not go against their conditions of service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to promoting the rule of law and the rights and protections we enjoy as a democratic nation. Of these, our right to free speech and free expression is one of the most highly valued and fiercely protected. The ability of citizens to speak freely and openly is the hallmark of a robust democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, there has never been an absolute right to free speech in Australia. Free speech is balanced against other considerations, such as whether speech is threatening, offensive or defamatory. The Government's position is that measures to filter, block or 'take down' content on social media websites should be used to protect users from harm, such as by removing online abuse material; or to remove material relating to serious criminal activity, such as content that represents an incitement to violence, or is child exploitation or child sexual abuse material.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Major digital platforms sites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, have terms of use that govern how users and others interact with them. Social media platforms are private corporations and are well within their rights to enforce their own terms of use and policies, which users agree to by using their service. It is a decision for the company to determine whether an account or piece of content is in breach of a company's policies and how it will respond. However, the Australian Government expects social media platforms to consistently enforce their standards, so that content that is neither harmful nor in breach of a platform's terms of use is not taken down without reason.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social media platforms have complaints mechanisms for users to raise concerns about the removal of content and accounts. If members of the public feel that a social media website provider has inappropriately removed their content or breached its own terms of use, they can appeal directly to the provider to seek a resolution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises particular concerns with censorship of political discussion, particularly in relation to the United States of America's (US) 2020 presidential election. Social media website providers have made statements that they have flagged or censored user-generated content when that content breaches the website's terms of use, including by spreading misinformation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports actions by social media website providers to combat misinformation. Following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019, the Government directed industry to develop and implement an industry code of conduct to address disinformation and misinformation on their services. The Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI) developed the voluntary Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (Code) on behalf of the Australian digital industry and released the Code on 22 February 2021. The Code has been adopted by Twitter, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Redbubble and TikTok, with other digital platforms also encouraged to sign up. Further information on the Code is available on the DIGI website, digi.org.au/disinformation-code/.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing these concerns to my attention. I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Working Holiday Maker Program</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 enclosing Petition EN2434 concerning extending Working Holiday visas granted before the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that Working Holiday Makers (WHMs) provide an important cultural and economic contribution to Australia, including through their spending, the work they undertake and job creation in associated industries and businesses. The Government also recognises the importance of WHMs to Australia's economic recovery during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The main purpose of the WHM program is to build people to people and cultural links between Australia and partner countries. The WHM visa program is a reciprocal arrangement, agreed between partner countries and is targeted specifically at young people. Australia and most WHM arrangement partner countries have agreed to the 18-30 year age bracket, with the age limit being extended to 35 years on a reciprocal basis with a small number of partner countries. All parameters of the program, including the age limit, are negotiated between countries and set through mutual agreement. These agreed positions cannot be changed unilaterally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the valuable role of WHM visa holders, the Government has introduced a number of measures over recent months. For example, WHM visa holders who were unable to travel to Australia or had to leave Australia early due to COVID-19 will be able to apply for a further WHM visa with no visa application charge (VAC), if they continue to meet the age limit, otherwise they can get a VAC refund if they exceed the age limit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The reopening of the border to groups of visa holders must be based on expert health advice and balanced against the Government's intent for imposing the travel ban and the health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers. Further information is available on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: http://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding Petition Number EN2436 which calls for the House to consider supplying COVID-19 vaccines and logistic support to all Pacific Island countries to ensure full population coverage, and permit quarantine free travel within the Pacific region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has committed to supporting comprehensive vaccine coverage in the Pacific, in coordination with New Zealand, France and the United States. The Regional Vaccine Access and Health Security Initiative includes $200 million to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the Pacific.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By 12 June, Australia will have provided over 280,000 AstraZeneca doses to Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, with further deliveries scheduled including to other Pacific countries. On 5 May the government announced a partnership with UNICEF to procure vaccines for up to 6 million people in the Pacific. This is in addition to the $130 million we have committed to the COVAX Facility's Advance Market Commitment, which to date has delivered over 340,000 doses to the Pacific. We are also supporting Pacific governments to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, including through logistical support and training of health workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Supporting our neighbours to access vaccines means the Pacific region will be a step closer to international travel when conditions allow, including for Pacific workers.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation. It is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning the Petition EN2445 on the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to those who wish to be vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) undertook an independent and rigorous assessment of the available data for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The data provided to the TGA was comprehensive and included clinical studies, non-clinical and toxicology studies, chemistry, manufacturing, risk management and other information. All data was carefully reviewed by a large team of TGA's technical and clinical experts before provisionally approving the Pfizer vaccine. Supply of Moderna's vaccine in Australia will only commence after the TGA has decided that the potential benefits outweigh the risks for the intended use of this vaccine. An application by Moderna for provisional registration of its COVID-19 vaccine is expected shortly by the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by a number of global regulatory agencies (84 and 46 countries respectively). Real world data collated and analysed as part of the global rollout have shown that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly effective vaccines, with 94-95 per cent effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 and up to 100 per cent effectiveness against severe disease and death. Data has also shown that only minor adverse experiences are noted with these vaccines, which is limited to swelling, pain and soreness at the injection site. To date, no new or confirmed safety signals have been reported for the mRNA vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Both vaccines retain efficacy against COVID-19 variants. The technology used in the mRNA vaccines mean they can be quickly adapted and manufactured to account for virus variants in the future if necessary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Technology using mRNA has been in development for decades, with clinical trials in humans being conducted as early as 2011. The COVID-19 pandemic provided funding and opportunity for researchers who have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines to produce safe and effective vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use a fragment of mRNA to instruct the body to generate an immune response against COVID-19. The mRNA is broken down quickly by the body. It never enters the nucleus and cannot affect or combine with our DNA in any way to change our genetic code or the body's cells. Instead, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines teach the body's cells how to make a protein that triggers a specific immune response to protect against COVID-19. The vaccines work with the body's natural defences to develop immunity to disease, so the body is able to rapidly create its own antibodies to prevent disease if it encounters the virus in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's priority remains to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, where the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks. This will reduce pressure on health care services, including hospitals and intensive care facilities and help to protect the health of Australians who are at higher risk of severe disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 13 May 2021 regarding petition number EN2448. I note the petition requests changing the dates of the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) testing in 2021 as it coincides with Islamic festival Eid al-Fitr, marking the conclusion of Ramadan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">NAPLAN is held at the commencement of Term 2 each year. It is complex to schedule the NAPLAN testing window across the nation and this decision is made in collaboration with all jurisdictions and set many years in advance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Islamic special events and rituals are set by the lunar calendar, the dates for these events change from year to year. While this year's test event coincided with Ramadan, the proposed NAPLAN schedule for 2022-24 is outside of Ramadan and the start of Eid al-Fitr.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition number EN2459.The petition relates to the content of one of the House of Representatives infosheets and refers to an earlier petition (EN1252), regarding communication with constituents.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the infosheet series is to educate members of the public on the operation of the House and Parliament, and Australia's system of government. The series is maintained by the Department of the House of Representatives, for which I have oversight responsibility.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The House infosheet series is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that information is current and, where necessary, reflects changes in House practice and procedure. Members of Parliament and their staff are not involved in this process, although it would be open to any Member to draw the attention of departmental staff to errors of fact.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The infosheet that is the subject of the petition, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infosheet 15: The work of a Member of Parliament</span>, was last updated in March 2020. The department has advised that the changes made at this time were mostly stylistic in nature. The line that is referred to in petition EN1252—'communication skills are important in all aspects of a Member's work, but are particularly so in working with constituents'—remains under the heading 'What skills does a Member need?' on page 1.</span>

Australia is supporting the training of community and faith leaders to challenge harmful gender norms in society and encourage women's engagement in political and economic affairs . The program's impact is demonstrating that better-informed religious and community leaders can become gender-conscious mediators and advocates for women's rights, and highlighting the crucial role of men and boys in combatting violence against women and girls.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021 enclosing Petition EN2485 concerning allowing extended family members of Australians who have received the COVID-19 vaccine to travel to Australia. Your correspondence was referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government regularly reviews Australia's travel restrictions policy as national and global circumstances in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic evolve, and is guided by the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee in relation to easing restrictions on international travel.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 13 May 2021 referring to petition number EN2487, which requests that the voting age be lowered to 16 years of age. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that the right to vote applies from an appropriate age, to ensure that electors can adequately understand parliamentary representation, enrolment and the electoral process. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> provides that persons aged 16 years and over may enrol provisionally, ahead of becoming eligible to vote when they are 18 years of age. This is one way of encouraging people to start thinking about their future rights and responsibilities as voters, before they become qualified to vote.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Young people who have an interest in politics can also participate in public debates in various ways including by making submissions to parliamentary committees or by writing to members of Parliament. The Government also provides funding for a range of educational programs and resources, including the Museum of Australian Democracy, to help young Australians build their understanding of how Australia's system of government works.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no plans to change the voting age, noting that while 16- and 17-year­ olds do take on significant responsibilities, in most cases this is under parental guidance. Voting, like most other social and legal norms does not and should not apply full responsibility until the age of 18.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the matters referred to in this petition to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 13 May 2021 concerning Petition Number EN2490, presented to the House of Representatives on 12 May 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition called for a ban on circumcision of all children, boys and girls. The Australian Government cannot support a blanket ban on circumcision, as there are circumstances in which it is both appropriate and necessary for a male to undergo the procedure. Information concerning circumcision and the situations where it is appropriate to be performed on health grounds is provided at: www.healthdirect.gov.au/male-circumcision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) currently provides benefits to patients for circumcision of the penis (MBS Items 30658 and 30654). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Health Insurance Act 1973</span>, stipulates that Medicare benefits are only payable for clinically relevant services provided by health practitioners. A clinically relevant service is one that is generally accepted by the relevant profession as necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The government relies on the judgement of health practitioners to determine whether medical services are clinically relevant and meet the MBS item descriptor requirements in deciding whether a procedure is necessary for a particular patient, including infants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medical professional groups such as the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons, the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Paediatric Association do not support routine male circumcision except where it is clinically relevant and there is an identified need for surgery to improve the patient's health. The policy statements from these organisations and other jurisdictions can be found at: www.cirp.org/library/statements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to know that some states (such as New South Wales and Victoria) have policies that circumcision on infants does not routinely occur in public hospitals. Data is publicly available for services funded under the MBS, however, there is no specific register related to circumcision.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to female circumcision, this is illegal in Australia. It is also illegal to take female children overseas for this procedure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 13 May 2021 to the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, enclosing petition EN2502, which requests the Commonwealth Government declare a National Day of Remembrance for COVID-19 on 26 October 2021. The Prime Minister has asked me to respond on his behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">National days may be observed without a proclamation or intervention by the Australian Government. A number of days throughout the year have gained community acceptance as the dates on which particular events are celebrated or commemorated. These events generally evolve without government involvement. Examples include Mothers' Day and Red Nose Day. The proclamation of 'days of national observance' by the Governor-General is one of a number of ways to promote the observation of days of celebration or commemoration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has acknowledged the response to the COVID-19 crisis has been unprecedented, both on the front-line and behind the scenes. Suitably the focus for the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments is the health and wellbeing of Australians, their livelihoods, their jobs and ensuring Australia is positioned to emerge strong and robust.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to the Government's attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2515. The petition requests a Royal Commission into Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and veteran suicide as well as depression.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you will be aware, on 19 April 2021 the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced the Australian Government's intention to establish a Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide from 1 July 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission is expected to examine the systemic issues and any common themes in past deaths by suicide of ADF members and veterans and the experience of members and veterans who may continue to be at risk of suicide. This includes all aspects of service in the ADF and the experience of those transitioning; the availability and quality of health and support services; pre-service and post-service issues for members and veterans; members' and veterans' social and family contexts, such as family breakdown, as well as housing and employment issues for members and veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister asked me to lead a public consultation process around these themes to inform the Terms of Reference for the Royal Commission. This consultation period has now closed and I have provided feedback to the Attorney-General, Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash, to lead the process for the drafting of the Letters Patent for the establishment of the Royal Commission. ADF members, veterans and their families, as well as other interested stakeholders, were also able to provide feedback directly to the Attorney-General's Department through its website.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 regarding House of Representatives petition EN2521 requesting that the House ensure that the "special witness" feature/status offered to a female is removed to ensure parity in the legal framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vulnerable witness protections are designed to support complainants in certain matters to provide evidence in court proceedings and include use of pre-recorded testimony and closed-circuit television to give evidence and restrictions on cross-examination in certain circumstances. These measures support complainants to present their best possible testimony and reduce the risk that complainants will be re-traumatised while giving evidence. They do not affect the weight that is given to evidence by the trier of fact, nor do they remove a defendant's right to challenge that evidence. The availability of vulnerable witness protections is not limited by the gender of the complainant. Men and women are equally entitled to vulnerable witness protections provided that certain requirements are met.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the Commonwealth level, vulnerable witness protections are available to children and adult complainants involved in specified proceedings (slavery, trafficking arid child sex abuse offences in respect of children complaints; slavery and trafficking offences in respect of adult complainants) and to 'special witnesses' in respect of proceedings for any Commonwealth offence. A person may be declared a special witness if the court is satisfied that the person is unlikely to be able to satisfactorily give evidence in the ordinary manner because of a disability or because of intimidation, distress or emotional trauma.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes that a mixed model of balanced private and public health services is integral to the provision of universal access to high quality, affordable health care services for all Australians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's health system is one of the best in the world and strives to provide safe and affordable high quality care for every Australian. While our health system performs well, there is a need to ensure the health system continues to meet changing health needs in a flexible and sustainable manner, to achieve the best outcomes for the Australian population now and into the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2020-25 National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) was agreed by the Australian Government with all state and territory governments on 29 May 2020, and commenced on 1 July 2020. The NHRA sets out the financial and governance arrangements for Australia's public hospital system for the next five years. It also includes a shared commitment by all Australian governments to long-term system-wide health reforms to improve health outcomes for all Australians, and create a more efficient and sustainable health system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NHRA recognises the states and territories as system managers of their public hospital systems, with responsibility for delivering emergency Department, admitted and non-admitted care, and other services (for example, specialist, mental health and sub-acute care). As system managers, the states and territories are responsible for determining the mix of the services and functions delivered within their jurisdiction, and for system-wide public hospital service planning and performance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the NHRA, the state and territory governments have committed to providing eligible patients with the choice to receive public hospital services free-of-charge, on the basis of clinical need and within a clinically appropriate period. States have also committed to have arrangements in place to ensure equitable access to such services, regardless of geographical location.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the NHRA, the Australian Government is providing a record funding contribution to assist states and territories with the costs of delivering public hospital services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's funding contribution for public hospitals services in all states and territories under the NHRA has grown substantially from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 to $25.5 billion in 2019-20, or by 92 per cent. Funding under the 2020-25 NHRA is projected to continue to grow to $135.4 billion between 2020-21 and 2024-25. This funding will mean more doctors, more nurses and importantly more services and support for patients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Australian Government is investing $1.25 billion through the Community Health and Hospitals Program to fund projects and services in every state and territory, supporting patient care while reducing pressure on community and hospital services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NHRA builds on the collaboration between the Australian Government and the states and territories in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the Australian health system remains stable and nationally coordinated, particularly throughout this unprecedented time.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2526, which requests that the Basic Religious Charity category and exemptions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012</span> (the ACNC Act) be abolished. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, some religious entities registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) can be designated as a 'basic religious charity'. This results in fewer reporting and other obligations under the ACNC Act. Basic religious charities are not required to provide financial information as part of their Annual Information Statements, submit annual financial reports, or comply with the governance standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of a basic religious charity was incorporated into the ACNC Act in part to reflect the concepts of religious freedom in the Australian Constitution and under international human rights laws. The exemptions granted to basic religious charities are intended to reduce the governance and compliance requirements placed on small religious bodies which are not incorporated and receive little direct funds from government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An organisation must meet strict eligibility requirements to be registered as a basic religious charity. This includes, among other criteria, that the organisation is registered only with the charitable purpose of advancing religion and not any other subtype, that it is not a deductible gift recipient, and that the total grants it receives from Australian government agencies in a financial year does not exceed $100,000.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to emphasise the Australian Government's commitment to ensuring that children are safe and protected from abuse. The Australian Government is currently working to implement its response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (the Royal Commission), which investigated how institutions and governments can better protect children, how they can achieve best practice in reporting and responding to incidents and how to address the impact of child sexual abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its response, the Government established the National Redress Scheme to ensure that people who experienced institutional child sexual abuse receive redress through financial payments, counselling and psychological care. The Government has taken specific steps to ensure that all charities, including basic religious charities, are accountable under the scheme. On 25 February 2021, a new ACNC governance standard came into effect which requires registered charities to take reasonable steps to join the Scheme if an application has been made or is likely to be made against them. Alongside this governance standard, the Government amended the ACNC Act to require basic religious charities with an application made against them to join the Redress Scheme. Basic religious charities that fail to meet this requirement will lose their status and exemptions under the ACNC Act, and then be subject to all ACNC governance standards, including the new governance standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 24 May 2021 to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, the Hon Michael McCormack MP, enclosing petition EN2543 concerning seeking travel exemptions for parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents to travel to Australia. Your correspondence was referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs, as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in the correspondence to you of 25 January 2021 from the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Peter Dutton MP, in response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN1860 Inclusion of Parents as "Immediate" family members for travel exemption</span>, and my correspondence to you of 25 May 2021 in response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN2311 Include parents as immediate family members for travel exemption</span>, currently no consideration is being given to broaden the definition of immediate family and automatically exempt parents from the travel restrictions for travel to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Individuals, including parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents, who are not automatically exempt from the travel restrictions but have a compelling reason to travel to Australia, can submit a travel exemption request for an assessment against the exemption categories outlined on the Department of Home Affairs' website at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An exemption request should be accompanied by the individual's details, case information and supporting statement and can be submitted through the online portal on the Department's website at: https://travel-exemptions.homeaffairs.gov.au/tep.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions to grant exemptions must be balanced against the Government's intent for imposing the travel restrictions, that is, the potential health risks posed to the Austral ian community by international travellers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Federal Election</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 24 May 2021 regarding petition EN2544, which proposes that a federal election is held immediately. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would be aware, under the Australian Constitution, the House of Representatives may sit for a maximum of three years from the first meeting of the House after a federal election, but may be dissolved sooner. Senators are elected for six-year terms on a rotating membership, with half of the Senators being elected every three years. Newly-elected Senators commence their six-year term on 1 July, with half-Senate elections required to be held within one year before the places of the Senators become vacant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, half-Senate elections are held concurrently with elections for the House of Representatives. Noting that half of the current Senators' terms are due to expire on 30 June 2022, the next federal election (simultaneous half-Senate and House of Representatives election) may be called as early as Saturday 7 August 2021, or as late as Saturday 22 May 2022. The Governor-General may call a federal election, on the advice of the Prime Minister, through issuing a formal order (writ) for the election. However, the Governor-General may not call an election outside of the timeframes outlined above, except in the case of a double dissolution election. Consequently, the Government cannot call an immediate election, as the petitioners suggest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, I would like to assure the petitioners that, when the next federal election is called in accordance with the requirements outlined above, it will be conducted within the legislated timeframes. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> (the Electoral Act) governs the timing of different aspects of the election following the issue of the writs, such as the final date for the nomination of candidates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners also request the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) be provided with powers to prevent and prosecute ineligible, unlawful or misleading incidents in the lead-up to an election, and disqualify parties or candidates that are party to any such incidents. The AEC already has powers to prosecute activities which are prohibited under the Electoral Act, as well as administering the Act's requirements for candidate and political party eligibility. Moreover, illegal activities not covered under the Electoral Act are captured under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995</span> (the Criminal Code). The existing provisions in the Electoral Act and the Criminal Code ensure that the AEC and other government entities can appropriately respond to unlawful election-related incidents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government takes political freedoms seriously, and considers the rights of Australians to engage in our electoral system imperative to the functioning of Australia's democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My response remains unchanged. In essence, there is a legislated process for seeking a change to the Statements of Principles (SOPs). This is for an eligible person to contact the Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA) to request an investigation of the sound scientific and medical evidence regarding the causation of a condition. The Government cannot direct the RMA to include specific factors in the SOPs, nor would it be appropriate to do so. Should an RMA investigation conclude there is sound medical and scientific evidence to include a factor, then the relevant Statement of Principle(s) will be amended. The RMA can be contacted by email at info @rma.gov.au , by telephone on (07) 3815 9404 or via online feedback form at www.rma.gov.au/contact-us.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Notwithstanding those concerns, as the Minister for Sport, Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck, has said, the Australian Government is not supporting calls for an athlete boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Responsibility for sending teams to the Olympic and Paralympic Games rests solely with the independent Australian Olympic Committee and Paralympics Australia. Preparing for the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a lifelong endeavour for many athletes, and those who qualify should have the opportunity to compete.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Owing to the short amount of time between now and the start of the 2022 Winter Games, we do not believe it is feasible to relocate the Games away from Beijing. Having hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Games, we understand the level of commitment and preparation that would be required by any prospective host country.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The promotion and protection of human rights around the world are a matter of high priority for the government.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 24 May 2021 regarding petition EN2574, which proposes mandatory voter identification and additional restrictions with respect to postal voting. I am responding as the Assistant Minister for Electoral Matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to strengthening the integrity of our electoral system, and maintaining voter confidence in elections. While mandatory voter identification could be one method to provide additional confidence, such a policy would require legislative amendment, and appears unlikely to attract bipartisan support at this time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2020-21 Budget, the Government has provided $96.7 million over three years to commence the modernisation of the Australian Electoral Commissions' (AEC) ICT systems and infrastructure, to protect the integrity of federal elections and improve services to Australian voters. Further funding of $26.8 million was also provided in December 2020 to support the continued rollout of Electronic Certified Lists, which allow polling booths across the country to communicate in real-time. This ensures voters marked off the roll in one area are prevented from voting again elsewhere, catching out instances of multiple-voting in federal elections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the petitioners' request to restrict postal voting, I note the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</span> (the Electoral Act) already contains provisions outlining the grounds of application for a postal vote. These include instances where an individual is unable to attend a polling booth due to serious illness or residing overseas, as the petitioners suggest. The existing provisions in the Electoral Act ensure that postal voting is only available under specific circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is considering the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report into the conduct of the 2019 federal election, which includes recommendations relevant to the matters of voter identification and postal voting raised by the petitioners. The Government will provide a full response to each of the recommendations in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which is the entity responsible for regulating this aspect of a superannuation fund's operations, recently released draft guidance on how licensees should manage the financial risks associated with climate change (see Prudential Practice Guide: Draft CPG 229 <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate Change Financial Risks</span>). The draft guidance is available from the APRA website: www.apra.gov.au.</span>

A responsible officer of the licensee must answer that question at the meeting or within one month after the meeting. In addition, the minutes of the meeting must include the answer to that question.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, Education Ministers agreed a regular review of the curriculum should occur every six years. The last review occurred in 2014. On 12 June 2020, all Education Ministers agreed to the Terms of Reference for the current review to ensure the curriculum remains current and continues to meet the needs of students in line with the Alice Springs (Mparntwe) Education Declaration.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 24 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2585 regarding a request that Gold Cards be provided to veterans covered by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988</span> (DRCA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The veteran Gold Card provides for treatment for all health conditions, whether or not they are related to service. It is an entitlement which is targeted towards meeting the health needs of those eligible current and former Australian Defence Force members whose service has caused, or has an acknowledged higher likelihood of causing, significant health problems. This includes those veterans who served on active operations against an enemy during a war or conflict, and those who have a high level of disability caused by their service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligibility for the Gold Card exists under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> (VEA) and <span style="font-style:italic;">the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> (MRCA) and is also available to Australian participants in British Nuclear Testing and members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization medical teams in Vietnam . The DRCA differs from the VEA and the MRCA, as it only provides treatment and compensation for conditions accepted as being related to service . It currently makes no provision for the treatment of any non-service-related injuries and diseases. As such, there is no legislative basis under the DRCA to issue the Gold Card, even where a veteran has a high level of service-related impairment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2019 Productivity Commission report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Better Way to Support Veterans</span>, made recommendations about bringing certain aspects of DRCA entitlements and eligibility in line with the other Acts administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). As was noted in the Government's interim response to the Productivity Commission report, these recommendations, which focus on simplifying and harmonising legislation, processes and benefits will be important considerations as OVA continues to improve the accessibility, simplicity, and continuity of support for veterans and their families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Productivity Commission also specifically recommended against providing a Gold Card under DRCA. While the Government's interim response to the Productivity Commission rejected the recommendation that there be no further expansion of Gold Card eligibility, any change to provide a Gold Card to veterans covered under the DRCA will require passage of legislation. The cost implications of such a change would require Government consideration in a Budget context .</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2594 - foreign ownership of Australian land. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment provides significant benefits to Australia. It is important for economic growth and job creation, and it contributes to the prosperity of businesses, communities, and the overall economy. Without foreign investment, Australia's production, employment, and income would all be lower.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment into Australia, including foreign acquisitions of land, is managed through Australia's foreign investment review framework. This framework strikes a balance between ensuring we remain an attractive investment destination and upholding the national interest so that Australians can be confident in the benefits of foreign investment. If it is determined that a proposed investment is contrary to Australia's national interest, it will not be approved or conditions will be applied to safeguard the national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Comprehensive reforms to the foreign investment review framework also came into effect from 1 January 2021. These reforms update the framework in three broad ways: they address national security risks; strengthen the existing system, particularly as it relates to compliance by foreign investors; and streamline investment in non-sensitive businesses.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2598 requesting the Australian Government remove the mandatory influenza vaccination requirement to visit residential aged care facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">States and territories established directions under their emergency management provisions in response to COVID-19, which set out requirements with regard to visitors to and entry into residential aged care facilities. The directions give effect to the recommendations of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), endorsed by National Cabinet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The entry restrictions generally apply to individuals entering a residential aged care facility, including staff, visitors, health practitioners, volunteers and others. There are differences and exemptions across the jurisdictions regarding when an influenza vaccination is available to a person. Broadly speaking however there are no exemptions to the influenza vaccination requirements for individuals that choose not to be vaccinated for personal, cultural or religious reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The directions are temporary, established under individual jurisdictions' emergency management provisions in response to COVID-19. It is a matter for the individual state and territory governments to update, extend or repeal the directions/Public Health Orders in response to the evolving COVID-19 situation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Jurisdictions have published supporting information, for individuals to understand how the directions apply to their personal circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the legality of state and territory directions, there is an array of statutory powers that can be exercised in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The key statutes which confer these types of powers for use in the current circumstances are powers that are conferred under various Public Health and Biosecurity statutes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is a strong supporter of immunisation in that it is a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While noting that states and territories have established entry restrictions to residential aged care facilities for individuals that do not meet certain vaccination requirements, immunisation is not compulsory and people maintain the right to choose whether to receive an influenza vaccination. It is recommended that employees discuss specific vaccination requirements with their employer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccines are only made available in Australia and included on the National Immunisation Program after they have been rigorously tested, evaluated and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to ensure they meet stringent safety and efficacy guidelines. Vaccines continue to be tested after their introduction via additional clinical trials, surveillance and monitoring of vaccine adverse events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, residential aged care workers and residents are a priority and have been among the first people in Australia to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. On 22 January 2021, the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison MP, announced that National Cabinet had agreed the AHPPC interim advice that state and territory public health orders should not be utilised to require vaccination against COVID-19 for residential aged care facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN2605</span> - introduction of statutory timeframe on deciding <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> (VEA) claims and applications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of statutory timeframes for determining claims under veterans and other compensation legislation has been examined in the past. A number of reviews have concluded that statutory timeframes would not produce better outcomes for veterans and may deliver unintended consequences. These reviews include (but are not limited to):</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">In June 2014, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission released a report into the 'Review of Statutory Timeframes under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act </span>2004 (MRCA)'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Discussion of the use of statutory timeframes under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Most recently the 2019 Productivity Commission report "A Better Way to Support Veterans" which did not support the establishment of statutory timeframes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These reviews have generally concluded that statutory timeframes lead to adverse, unexpected and inequitable outcomes, and are generally detrimental to veterans. Defined timeframes to decide claims may result in a number of adverse outcomes, including poor and incorrect decisions being made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition notes that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Act 2019</span> includes a 90 day commitment for the determination of claims under the MRCA. This aspirational goal, which does not represent a statutory timeframe, recognises that claims will be decided in a time that is proportionate to the complexity of the matter. Because of the varied complexity of claims there will always be differences in timeliness of decision making.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of factors which can result in delays in processing a claim. As well as the number of claims on hand, the time taken to determine claims can be influenced by the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The time between an incident or a veteran's service and the subsequent lodgement of a claim, which may make accessing relevant evidence difficult.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The complexity of the claim (for instance whether the relevant service is covered under one or multiple Acts or the number of conditions lodged with the claim).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The need to obtain further information from the veteran, the Australian Defence Force, medical practitioners or witnesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many of these factors are outside the control of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A defined timeframe in which to determine a claim is likely to create additional pressures on delegates, which could impact on the quality of decision making. It would also require others involved in the process, such as medical practitioners, to prioritise the provision of claim information, potentially at the expense of providing timely health care for the benefit of veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the potential consequences for not meeting a defined statutory timeframe will also create difficulties:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An automatic rejection after a set period has elapsed may disadvantage veterans (although it is acknowledged that this would encourage submission of complete and detailed claims with relevant supporting evidence).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">This option was considered and rejected by Parliament in the context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Im</span><span style="font-style:italic;">proving the Comcare Scheme) Bill </span><span style="font-style:italic;">2015</span> on the basis that it would require a client to contest a mandated rejection through relevant appeals processes, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">It may also create perverse incentives for delegates to finalise claims without adequately investigating a claim or obtaining the relevant evidence, resulting in incorrect outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An automatic acceptance may lead to inconsistent outcomes for veterans in the same circumstances, regardless of the evidence or merits of a case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Productivity Commission noted that this could create perverse incentives among veterans to submit incomplete, incorrect or late information in order to ensure the timeframe elapses before a claim can be determined.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">This could also mean that weak claims that should not otherwise succeed would be determined favourably and more complex (or historical) cases where there is a lack of evidence available or easily accessible will by default succeed, which could again lead to inequitable outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">In the case of automatic acceptance the approach could also result in unnecessary (and potentially large) debts arising where a subsequent review finds the veteran is ineligible for a benefit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Set timeframes may also make it more likely that claims would be determined without consideration of the full merits of the case and result in inequitable outcomes among clients with similar circumstances. Even without a defined outcome, set timeframes could create a situation where, due to time pressures, claims may be accepted where they should be rejected and rejected where they should be accepted. This would not conform with the intent of the legislation, which is to arrive at the correct or preferable outcome on the basis of the available evidence and in accordance with the relevant statutory tests.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, set timeframes may result in higher error rates and require veterans to pursue the proper entitlements through prolonged, stressful and potentially unnecessary appeals processes. Ultimately, this could result in increased time taken to finalise a claim.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the Government has taken numerous steps to mitigate the impact of claim determination times on veterans and eligible dependants. For example, the Government has introduced the Veteran Payment, a temporary payment providing financial support while mental health claims are being assessed. The trial of provisional access to medical treatment for the top 20 claimed conditions while these claims are being assessed has recently been extended. Policy initiatives have also led to a reduction in the time taken to process claims through the streamlining and straight-through-processing of certain conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Due to the Government's significant reforms in recent years encouraging engagement with DVA, raising awareness of the right to claim and making it easier for veterans to do so, claims have more than doubled between the financial years 2017-18 to 2019-20. This has created a backlog. The Government is committed to managing this backlog and has provided DVA with more than $98 million through the 2021-22 Budget to fund additional resources to attend to the increased workload. These combined initiatives will see an increase to DVA's staffing by more than 440 positions - the largest increase to DVA resourcing in decades. This demonstrates the Government's commitment to reducing the claims backlog and reducing the time taken to determine a claim.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly believes that the best way to address the gender pay gap is through the government, business and the community all taking action on this issue.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The2021-22 Women's Budget Statement provides a $3.4 billion investment towards women's safety, economic security, health and wellbeing. The Government is further investing in new arid expanded initiatives to provide practical and effective support to increase women's workforce participation, reduce barriers to women working in the paid workforce and assist women to build a financially secure future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the National Employment Standards of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009</span> (Fair Work Act), parental leave and related entitlements provide minimum leave entitlements for all employees covered by the national system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In November 2020, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Amendment (Improving Unpaid Parental Leave for Parents of Stillborn Babies and Other Measures) Act 2020</span> was passed to ensure that families dealing with the trauma of stillbirth, premature birth or the death of their child during unpaid parental leave are able to take the unpaid parental leave they had planned to take without having to worry about returning to work before they are ready to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has zero tolerance for violence against women and children. In December 2018, the Coalition passed historic legislation enshrining five days' unpaid family and domestic violence leave in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act'</span>s National Employment Standards. This followed the independent Fair Work Commission's decision to grant five days of unpaid family and domestic violence leave to employees covered by a modern award.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Commission is reviewing the family and domestic violence leave clause in modern awards. Further consideration of the issue of paid leave will be appropriately informed by the Commission's consideration of the issue. Employers of course remain free to provide entitlements that suit their workplaces, and the Government commends initiatives of large employers in providing paid domestic violence leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Act is the legislation governing the employee and employer relationship in Australia and includes the objective of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value as part of the principles relating to the 'safety net' of minimum wages and conditions. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act</span> also includes a specific provision for the making of Equal Remuneration Orders to ensure that, for employees to whom the order will apply, there will be equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Workplace Gender Equality Agency continues to promote gender pay equity in organisations through a range of mechanisms, including: annual gender reporting; resources such as conducting a gender pay gap audit and developing a gender pay equity strategy; and through awareness campaigns and partnerships programs including the Pay Equity Ambassador network.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning petition number EN2609.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before a prescription medicine (including a COVID-19 vaccine) can be legally supplied in Australia, the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) rigorously assesses the safety, quality and effectiveness to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA prepares and publishes Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs) for prescription medicines (including vaccines) that provide information about the evaluation of a medicine and the considerations that led the TGA to approve, or not approve, an application and subsequent use of that medicine or vaccine. AusPARs will be published for COVID-19 vaccines evaluated by the TGA. Further information is available on the TGA's website at: www.tga.gov.au/ws-auspar-index.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After product registration, the TGA has an important role in batch-release assessment and post-market surveillance to ensure the ongoing safety of the vaccine. Vaccines continue to be tested after their approval for use via additional clinical trials, surveillance and monitoring for adverse events. Further information is available at: www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) and the Thrombosis and Haemostasis Society of Australia and New Zealand (THANZ) are closely monitoring local and international data on the very rare and newly identified condition associated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) or vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">TTS is a rare condition with a different mechanism to most other causes of thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia. Among case reports, there are no known markers for increased risk for TTS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">TTS is different from other blood clotting conditions and is triggered by the immune system's response to the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. It results in both thrombosis and low platelet levels. In the majority of cases, pathological antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein released from platelets, are detected. Studies are ongoing to better understand the exact mechanism of TTS. TTS has been reported in patients who have received the AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines (the latter is not used in Australia).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this time, you are not able to choose which vaccine you receive. The ATAGI has recommended the AstraZeneca vaccine for most of the adult population 50 years and older, including:</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 February 2021 enclosing Petition PN0494 concerning the impacts of migration on Australia's economy and infrastructure. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Over the past 40 years , Australia has enjoyed strong economic performance, underpinned by a growing population. This economic success has greatly enhanced our quality of life. Average incomes have doubled in real terms since 1975, with this increased wealth shared broadly across the community. As a result, Australian families enjoy access to a well-functioning health system, good schools, a strong social safety net and options for recreation and leisure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Population growth has two main components: natural increase; and net overseas migration (NOM). Since the year ending June 2006, NOM has been a key driver of Australia's population growth, labour force participation rates and GDP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">COVID-19 has had significant impacts on migration to Australia. NOM has been affected by international travel restrictions and weaker labour markets domestically and globally. Treasury forecasts in the 2021-22 Budget indicate that NOM will move to a net outflow of -97,000 by the end of 2020-21. This will be the first time that NOM has been a net outflow since 1946.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We know that carefully targeted migration will be a key component of Australia's economic recovery. The 2021-22 Migration Program will retain the existing policy settings put in place for the 2020-21 program year to build on Australia's success in managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and support Australia's continued economic recovery and drive positive social cohesion outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A well planned and managed immigration system contributes to the skills and capability of Australia's workforce; facilitates the transfer of knowledge and expertise to boost business and entrepreneurship; supports sustainable population planning; bolsters economic growth; and is key to securing social cohesion outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Well-targeted migration supports growth in productivity, raises workforce participation, and expands consumption possibilities. Migration can benefit consumers and businesses in our cities by addressing skills shortages and increasing competition in the labour market. For our regions, migration can be an opportunity to create new businesses and jobs, boost innovation, and drive greater economies of scale.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government, however, acknowledges the pressures that increased population can put on infrastructure and is committed to maximising the economic and social outcomes of immigration, particularly skilled migration, while also considering the long-term population impacts on state and territory planning and infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To this end, in 2019, the Government made a series of changes to address the issue of sustainable population growth across Australia, including the establishment of the Centre for Population within the Department of Treasury, in recognition of the need for a single point of analysis to assess, monitor and project changes to Australia's population. These initiatives are further supported by the publication of Australia's first Population Statement in December 2020, which can be accessed on the Centre for Population's website at: https://population.gov.au/publications/publications-population-statement.html.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</span> (VEA) and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004</span> (MRCA), the question of whether or not a medical condition can be found to have been caused by military service is determined on the basis of SOPs. These are created by an independent statutory authority, the RMA, on the basis of sound medical­scientific evidence. Where SOPs have been determined by the RMA in respect of a relevant condition, at least one factor in the SOP must be met and related to service in order for a claim for the condition to be accepted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government cannot direct the RMA to include specific factors in the SOPs and it would be inappropriate to do so, given the independence of the RMA and the role of the SOP system which is to ensure that SOP factors are based on, and claims are assessed according to, sound medical-scientific evidence on the causation of conditions. For your information, there are currently 15 conditions for which SOPs exist that include factors relating to exposure to dioxin-contaminated herbicides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The established and legislated process for seeking an amendment to the SOPs is to request the RMA to conduct an investigation into the condition. Veterans are able to directly approach the RMA to request an investigation into the conditions that are the subject of this petition. The RMA is required under the legislation to consider such a request and provide reasons for their decisions. A request for an investigation or review of existing SOPs can be lodged online on the RMA's website at: www.rma.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Should an investigation establish, on the sound medical-scientific evidence, that particular exposures are causal factors in the development of a medical condition, then the factor will be included in the relevant SOP for the condition by the RMA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention. I would encourage the petitioners to avail themselves of this review process so that the RMA is able to consider the substance of and evidence relating to the conditions which are the subject of petition number PN0504.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the Standing Committee on Petitions' correspondence concerning Petition EN111 - to halt foreign ownership of land.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment drives economic growth, creates skilled jobs, improves access to overseas markets and enhances productivity. Without foreign investment, production, employment and income would all be lower.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, the Australian Government recognises community concerns about foreign ownership of certain Australian assets, including land. The foreign investment review :framework allows the Government to consider these concerns when assessing Australia's national interest while ensuring Australia remains an attractive place to invest. If it is determined that a proposal is contrary to the national interest, it will not be approved or conditions will be applied to safeguard the national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to residential land, the Government's policy is to channel foreign investment into new dwellings as this increases the total dwelling stock in which Australians can live as well as creating additional jobs in the construction industry and supporting economic growth. Non-resident foreign persons are generally prohibited from purchasing established dwellings in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to agricultural land, the Government has acted to improve scrutiny and transparency around foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusinesses. The Government has also clarified that foreign investors can only acquire agricultural land where there has been an open and transparent sale process, thereby ensuring Australians have an opportunity to participate in the sale process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 March 2021 to the former Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon Christian Porter MP, referring Petition EN2272, which calls for protecting the right of employees to refuse· an employer's direction to get vaccinated against COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to providing all Australians with access to free, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. The Government position is that vaccination, while strongly encouraged, is voluntary, and the Commonwealth will not be legislating to require vaccination in the workplace. In line with this, the existing legal framework around workplace vaccination will continue to apply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under this framework, a worker may be required to be vaccinated where:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a public health order requiring vaccination is in place</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">a worker's contract or enterprise agreement allows it</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">an employer makes a lawful and reasonable direction to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Public health is primarily a state and territory responsibility and jurisdictions may issue public health orders requiring vaccination for workers in certain high-risk workplaces. Employers and workers must comply with public health orders, and sanctions may apply for non-compliance. States and territories have previously issued public health orders requiring influenza vaccinations for workers and other people in aged care facilities in the interests of protecting vulnerable Australians. National Cabinet has recently endorsed expert medical advice to require vaccination for workers in residential aged care and quarantine facilities as an essential part of reducing the risk of transmission and spread of COVID-19 into the community. These will be given effect through state and territory public health orders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Absent a public health order, vaccination can be required in the workplace where it is provided for under an enterprise agreement or contract. Such arrangements are uncommon, however, and in most circumstances an employer may only direct an employee to be vaccinated where this direction is considered lawful and reasonable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A direction by an employer will only be lawful where it does not contravene relevant laws, including anti-discrimination legislation. Discrimination laws may be relevant if a person is unable to comply with a vaccine requirement due to an underlying disability or medical condition. Employers should ensure that any requirements to vaccinate are consistent with discrimination law requirements before introducing a policy that requires employees to be vaccinated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whether an employer's direction will be reasonable must be assessed on a case by case basis. It will depend on the particular circumstances of a person's employment, the risks of contracting the disease, whether other control measures, such as the wearing of masks, may be an appropriate way of managing risks, and the particular circumstances in which the direction is given.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a general rule, a worker must comply, so far as they are reasonably able, with any lawful and reasonable instruction that is given by a business to an employee that concerns their employment. Where an employee refuses to comply with a lawful and reasonable direction, an employer will need to consider options for managing the employee, which may range from allocating alternative duties at one end of the spectrum, to termination at the other end.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Workplace vaccine guidance published by Safe Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman indicates that the overwhelming majority of employers should assume they cannot require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19.</span>

It also recognises that quality news and public interest journalism play an important role in the functioning of Australian society and democracy, and is essential to informing local communities .</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to promoting the rule of law and the rights and protections we enjoy as a democratic nation. Of these, our right to free speech and free expression is one of the most highly valued and fiercely protected. The ability of citizens to speak freely and openly is the hallmark of a robust democracy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">However, there has never been an absolute right to free speech in Australia. Free speech is balanced against other considerations, such as whether speech is harmful, threatening, offensive or defamatory. This includes disinformation and misinformation that harmfully misleads the Australian public on matters of public importance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry in 2019, the Government tasked the Australian Communications and Media Authority to oversee the development and implementation of a voluntary code to address disinformation and misinformation on digital platforms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital Industry Group Inc. (DIGI) developed the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and Misinformation (Code) on behalf of the Australian digital industry and released the Code on 22 February 2021. The Code has been adopted by Twitter, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Redbubble, TikTok, Adobe and Apple, with other digital platforms also encouraged to sign up. Further information on the Code is available on the DIGI website, digi.org.au/disinformation-code/.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 13 May 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition EN2473. This Petition requests amendments to the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code (the Code) to provide free consumer access to digital news media publications that receive government assistance. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response. I apologise for the delay in responding to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate, thereby helping to sustain public interest journalism in Australia. The Code will do this by:</span>

The Government is committed to maintaining the health and vibrancy of the ABC and the SBS. The provision of over $4 billion over the three years from 2019-20 represents a substantial investment of public funds in our national broadcasters, and will assist the ABC and SBS in the provision of television, radio and digital media services in line with their Charters.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our investment in the ABC is an important underpinning of media diversity and represents a significant contribution to civic journalism in Australia. The ABC's funding includes $43.7 million over the three years for the ABC to continue the Enhanced News measure, which supports local news and current affairs, including regional newsrooms and specialist investigative journalists.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 June 2021 enclosing Petition EN2535 concerning an exemption for parents of Australians and permanent residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has previously responded to <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN1860 – Inclusion of Parents as "Immediate" family members for travel exemption, Petition EN2311 - Include parents as immediate family members for travel exemption </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;"> Petition EN2543 - Travel exemption for parents of Australian ci</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tizens and permanent residents, </span>and<span style="font-style:italic;"> Petition EN2611 - Allow international travel to meet parents overseas</span>, which outlines the Government's position on including parents as an automatic exemption category from the travel restrictions for travel to Australia, and including 'travel to visit parents' as an exemption category for those Australians seeking to depart Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It must also be noted that on 2 July 2021, the National Cabinet agreed to temporarily reduce the current international passenger arrival caps to manage the pressure on quarantine facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, it is imperative that international travel to and from Australia is limited to exceptional circumstances only, as per the current exemption categories.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge that this is a challenging and difficult time for Australians who are separated from their loved ones overseas. However, the travel restrictions are in place to protect the broader Australian community from the health risks posed by discretionary international travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to regularly review Australia's travel restrictions policy as national and global circumstances in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic evolve, and continues to take a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, informed by the latest health advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with this commitment, on 2 July 2021, the National Cabinet also agreed to formulate a <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response</span> which outlines Australia's pathway out of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in this plan, easing travel restrictions and opening of international borders will be a phased approach that will be triggered by expert advice.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the travel restrictions remain in effect, individuals who are not automatically exempt from the travel restrictions, either for travel to Australia or depart, but have a compelling reason to travel, can submit a travel exemption request for an assessment against the exemption categories outlined on the Department of Home Affairs' website at:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Complementary Medicines</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 referring a copy of petition EN2559 calling for the Schedule to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994</span> (the Agvet Code) to be amended to classify naturopathic medicines and therapies for animal as low-risk veterinary products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agvet Code is focussed on products with a chemical or biological component and that are manufactured, intended or represented as having an effect on an animal or plant. The Agvet Code does not regulate physical therapies or devices, to the extent the device has no chemical or biologically active component.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For products with a chemical and biological component and for preventing or treating a disease or condition in an animal, the Agvet Code does not distinguish between synthetic pharmaceutical medicines and complementary animal health products (CAHPs) such as herbal, nutraceutical and homeopathic remedies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before agricultural and veterinary (agvet) chemical products can be legally manufactured, imported, supplied, sold or used in Australia, they must be assessed by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA). The assessment process involves a rigorous scientific evaluation of the safety, efficacy and trade risks posed by an agvet chemical product to protect the health and safety of people, animals, the environment and trade. The data and information needed to support a product's assessment varies according to the nature of the product, the claims made by the product and the intended use.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To protect animal health and manage the risks to Australia's trade from chemical residues in animal products, it is important that all veterinary medicines (pharmaceutical or CAHPs) are held to the same standards. A product that is unsafe or ineffective may be harmful to the health and welfare of animals and result in unnecessary suffering or death. Unlike humans, animals cannot make conscious decisions on their treatment, heightening the need to have appropriate regulatory oversight for these products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian regulatory framework for agvet chemical products includes a range of registration pathways for products of low regulatory concern that involve reduced data requirements, costs, and approval time compared to conventional veterinary products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some pathways establish standardised risk management approaches to ensure products meet the same high standard as products subject to bespoke assessment. The standards can set specific parameters as well as prescribed conditions that the product must meet. The APVMA assessment of products under these low regulatory concern pathways focuses purely on whether the product complies with the standard. The APVMA has established standards for joint health products for dogs and horses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Another pathway allows products conforming to a particular registration 'model' to be registered more rapidly as the APVMA is already satisfied that they comply with the statutory criteria for registration (safety, efficacy and trade criteria). A registration model is currently available for equine electrolyte products. While the APVMA may initiate a registration model, most registration models are proposed by industry groups. The APVMA assess the model, and the information supporting it, in much the same way that it assesses an application for registration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For the reasons highlighted above, the Australian Government considers that an amendment of the Agvet Code to classify alternative naturopathic medicines and therapies for animals as low-risk veterinary products is not warranted. However, the government recognises that there are opportunities for targeted improvements in specific regulatory areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that an independent panel of experts has recently completed a comprehensive review of the regulatory framework. The review examined the agvet chemicals regulatory framework's aims, structure, and operation, and made recommendations to ensure it is contemporary, fit for purpose and reduces unnecessary red tape. I am currently considering the final review report. The report will be published in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for referring this petition to me. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 May 2021 concerning <span style="font-style:italic;">Petition EN2562</span> - the nature of the evidence used by the Repatriation Medical Authority (RMA) to determine factors for the causes of diseases or injuries in the Statements of Principles (SOPs) for them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SOP system was created in 1994 precisely to avoid non-experts such as tribunals making uninformed judgements about complex medical scientific evidence. The system deliberately limits acceptable claims via the factors in the SOPs to those where the totality of sound medical scientific evidence (SMSE) suggests a causal link between the factor and the condition. The claimant merely has to establish the facts of service consistent with the cause outlined in the SOP factors.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Productivity Commission in its review of veterans' compensation, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Better Way to Support Veterans</span>, released 27 June 2019, endorsed the SOP system as 'robust and effective' and concluded that:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xD;&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">'it promotes consistency, predictability and transparency and draws a clear line between accepted and non-accepted conditions, based on sound medical scientific evidence [p.349].</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Having considered the system, the Commission recommended that it be extended to include claims under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence related Claims) Act 1988</span> (DRCA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition as presented requests the Parliament to replace the requirement for the RMA to act only on SMSE with a requirement to accept expert medical evidence that would otherwise be admissible in a court of law under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SMSE for the causes of a particular medical condition is limited to information that, 'meets the applicable criteria for assessing causation currently applied in the field of epidemiology'. This means the RMA currently has regard to standard epidemiological criteria to assess causation. A good example is the criteria under the Bradford Hill formulation, which are used in assessing the relationship between an exposure and the development of a condition. They include matters such as the strength of an association, its biological plausibility and the dose-response relationship. All these criteria involve inherent qualitative judgements and always require consideration of whether any suggested relationship is the result of chance, bias or confounding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The RMA considers these matters relying on studies in peer reviewed journals. Those studies range from systematic reviews of previous research and studies involving a cohort of subjects over a long period down to individual case reports. The RMA considers and evaluates the effect of the entirety of these studies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners complain that the process permits the RMA too much discretion. They suggest that if the requirement for SMSE was removed and the RMA was required to act on evidence that might be acceptable under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evidence Act 1995</span> (EA) in curial proceedings, it would make the RMA's processes more consistent with "natural justice".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 79 of the EA permits a court to accept the opinion of a person who has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, if that opinion is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. The adoption of that requirement would require the RMA to accept an opinion of a medical specialist given without supporting medical-scientific evidence, that a particular exposure is a cause of a relevant medical condition. Such an opinion does not meet the test for SMSE, is of less probative value in considering the causes of medical conditions than the SMSE, and the effect of the current legislation is that the RMA need not have regard to it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed change has the potential to return the system to the pre-1994 situation of duelling medical experts. The SOP system was introduced to avoid that approach by placing a focus on the current medical-scientific evidence concerning the particular medical condition under consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the proposed change would require the RMA before accepting an opinion to consider legal questions that are frequently raised in the courts, such as whether the expert has a relevant expertise and whether an opinion expressed is wholly or substantially based on their specialised knowledge. Currently, any person including a qualified expert, can submit an opinion with supporting SMSE and the RMA is obliged to consider it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The existing system is transparent with the reasoning of the RMA being available to interested parties, and there is ample opportunity in the existing legislation for SOPs to be reviewed on sound grounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that the RMA's reasoning in establishing the SOP factors is available to interested parties. The Reference Lists setting out the material relied on by the RMA in determining a SOP are available at www.rma.gov.au. As well, section 1961 of the VEA provides a statutory right for any veteran, member or ex-service organisation to have reasonable access to any document containing information considered by the Authority for the purposes of an investigation. This includes briefing papers prepared by the medical researchers who assist the RMA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The SOPs are required to be regularly reviewed as they are legislative instruments under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Legislation Act 2003</span>, and new SOPs for each condition are determined every seven to nine years lest they lapse under the sunsetting provisions. Section 196E of the VEA enables any veteran, member or ex-service organisation to request a review of a SOP and to insert a new factor or vary an existing one. If there is no SMSE supporting such a change the RMA can refuse to investigate it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement for the SOPs to be based on the SMSE is to the overall benefit of veterans and members of the Defence forces. It provides an objective system based on the best evidence related to the cause of particular diseases or injuries.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Interactive Gambling Act</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 24 May 2021 concerning Petition EN2592 requesting amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interactive Gambling Act 2001</span> (IGA) to allow online poker providers to offer their services in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since its inception in 2001, the IGA has made it an offence to provide or advertise prohibited interactive gambling services to customers in Australia. Prohibited services include online casino-style games of chance or mixed skill and chance, such as online poker, which are played for money or anything else of value. On 13 September 2017, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Interactive Gambling Amendment Act 2017</span> came into effect and strengthened the enforcement of the IGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The potential benefits and risks of legalising online poker need to be considered before any changes are made to the IGA. Legalising online poker would enable Australians to play with operators licensed and regulated in Australia, instead of playing with offshore operators which may provide limited harm minimisation and consumer protections. Other potential benefits include business opportunities for domestic licensees, employment growth, and revenue opportunities through licensing and taxation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are legitimate concerns, however, that legalising the provision of online poker services may expand the overall participation of gambling in Australia. In 2018-19, total gambling expenditure reached $25 billion in Australia. This is equal to $1,276 in losses per Australian adult, which is the highest per capita in the world. Proper harm minimisation tools need to be in place in order to limit any increase in problem and at­ risk gambling with the introduction of a new gambling service.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is well advanced in establishing the National Consumer Protection Framework for online wagering (National Framework). The National Framework consists of 10 consumer protection measures, including new requirements for operators to offer pre-commitment facilities to customers to limit gambling spend. The objective of the National Framework is to minimise the risk of gambling harm to Australian consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Six of the 10 measures have been implemented. The remaining elements will be rolled out over the next 12 months, subject to further trialling and testing of some measures. The National Self-Exclusion Register is a key element of the Framework and will allow individuals to self-bar themselves from online wagering services through a single transaction. On 23 June 2021, the Australian Communications and Media Authority announced the appointment of Engine Australia to deliver the register. The service is expected to be operational from mid-2022, with trials commencing in late 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Continued progress towards strengthening Australia's legislative framework is essential to minimising harm from problem gambling. The full implementation of the National Framework will provide an opportunity for Government to assess the regulatory environment and consider whether online poker services can be permitted in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Health Care</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 concerning Petition EN2616 to remove the requirement for international medical graduates (IMG) who wish to work in general practice to complete a pre-employment structured clinical interview (PESCI) in addition to the Australian Medical Council's (AMC) examinations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, the medical profession is regulated by the Medical Board of Australia (MBA), which includes the assessment of IMGs to practice. The MBA is supported in its role by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra). Policy oversight for the MBA and Ahpra is provided by all Australian Health Ministers under the National Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, as enacted in each state and territory. This oversight allows Ministers to ensure that the level of regulation is appropriate and commensurate to risks presented to public safety by medical practitioners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AMC is responsible for the assessment of IMGs against the minimum competencies of Australian trained medical graduates. To assess IMGs, the AMC has implemented a two-part examination, which includes a multiple choice and practical component designed to test the skills, knowledge and capability of an IMG at the level of a recent Australian medical graduate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IMGs who pass these exams are expected to complete a minimum of 47 weeks full time supervised practice equivalent to the internships completed by Australian trained medical graduates. The IMGs who wish to take up a position in a general practice setting, rather than a hospital setting, must complete a PESCI.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PESCI assesses an IMG against the requirements of a specific position in a general practice setting and considers factors outside of the skills, knowledge and capabilities assessed by the AMC examinations. While hospitals have the infrastructure to provide IMGs with extensive supervision and support, IMGs working in general practice under supervision are still required to make independent decisions about patient care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PESCI addresses this risk by ensuring the IMGs are appropriately skilled and experienced to meet the needs of the community and ensures that the support available in the general practice is sufficient. The PESCI is especially relevant in rural and remote settings. While the PESCI might seem burdensome for some general practices and IMGs, the MBA must be satisfied the IMG does not pose a risk to patient safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AMC has approved the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to conduct the PESCI. As the providers of specialist medical training in the field of general practice, ACRRM and the RACGP are best placed to assess the requirements for IMGs and general practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If an IMG has received an unsuccessful result from completion of a PESCI, in the first instance they should contact their PESCI provider or panel to seek information about their result. The MBA requires that ACRRM, RACGP and AMC have appeals and complaints mechanisms in place to address the concerns of any party affected by their decisions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">JobKeeper Payment</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 21 June 2021, originally directed to the Treasurer, concerning Petition (EN2617) - JobKeeper repayments. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The JobKeeper Payment (JobKeeper) was designed as a national scheme, to apply consistently across a broad range of Australian businesses and industry sectors. As such, the scheme was not intended to apply individual criteria for the Payment to any specific sector or group of Australian businesses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper was always intended to be a temporary program designed to support confidence and get businesses back up and running as soon as possible. It was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it has achieved its objective of keeping businesses in business and Australians in jobs. JobKeeper supported over one million businesses providing them the certainty and support they needed to continue trading and to retain workers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper initially used a prospective turnover decline test to ensure that businesses received support before they incurred large scale losses from the impacts of COVID-19 which compromised their viability, and before they were in a position where they needed to separate from their staff. The prospective turnover test was a key feature of JobKeeper that provided confidence at a time when businesses were facing an unprecedented level of uncertainty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the JobKeeper extension phase, eligibility was retested based on actual declines in turnover in the previous quarter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">JobKeeper payments were required to be passed through to eligible employees and there is no legal obligation for businesses who received JobKeeper to repay those amounts. However, a business may choose to voluntarily pay an amount which is equivalent to some or all of the JobKeeper payments that they received.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that a number of businesses have made voluntary repayments to the Australian Taxation Office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Modifying the eligibility criteria for JobKeeper to have included a measure of the profitability of a business would have introduced significant complexity and delays in the program. Such a test would have been difficult to design and implement with integrity on the scale required, given the variety in business models and structures across industries, and given the flexibility that businesses have in the management of their balance sheet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there may have been merit in considering such design elements if JobKeeper was intended to be an ongoing program, it is less clear that this would have been feasible or desirable in the context in which JobKeeper was implemented.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 21 June 2021 regarding petition EN2621 requesting that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</span> ('Act') be amended to provide further guidance on the expression 'other material' for the purposes of section 25D of the Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Section 25D of the Act was inserted in 1984 to provide a standard provision when a statute requires the giving of written reasons for a decision. This provision was derived from similar provisions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</span>. The requirement to provide a statement of reasons ensures that persons directly affected by a decision are given a full explanation as to why the decision was made. This enables them to make an informed decision about whether or not to exercise any appeal or review rights they may have.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the statement of reasons is required to include findings on material questions of fact and the basis of those findings, section 25D does not limit the information to which the decision maker may refer or direct the decision maker to consult particular material. Section 25D does not define the term 'other material', nor do related provisions. This ensures that the decision maker has an unfettered discretion to determine what other material to take into account when making factual findings. This allows full consideration to be given to diverse material that may be relevant to the circumstances of the particular decision. Where such material is taken into account this must be included in the statement of reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any amendment to the Act to include a meaning or definition of the term 'other material' could restrict the discretion of decision makers when making factual findings and may limit the utility of their statements of reasons. Therefore, I consider it would not be appropriate to amend the Act as suggested.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">
                <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  font-weight:bold;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />COVID-19: Vaccination</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 concerning Petition EN2628 on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the Pfizer vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The safety of the Australian population has always been the Australian Government's highest priority. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have been, and continue to be, based on the expert medical advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">People eligible for vaccination now have been identified taking into account the current supply of vaccines and public health, medical and epidemiological evidence on who would be most at risk of contracting COVID-19, or of serious illness if they contracted COVID-19. This is why the rollout has been focused on people who live or work in high risk settings, people with underlying medical conditions and older people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has accepted the medical advice of the ATAGI that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is preferred for individuals under 60 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For those aged 60 years and above, the individual benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine are greater than in younger people. The risks of severe outcomes or death from COVID-19 increase with age, and are particularly high in older, unvaccinated individuals. At the same time, the AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective at preventing death and severe illness among people who have contracted COVID-19, and the incidence of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TIS) is very rare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The benefit of preventing COVID-19 through AstraZeneca vaccination therefore outweighs the risk of TTS in this age group, and underpins its ongoing use for those aged 60 years and over.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The most effective way for people to protect themselves from the serious risks of COVID-19 is to be vaccinated, including with the AstraZeneca vaccine where recommended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before any COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use in Australia it is subject to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) stringent assessment and approval processes, after being tested in large clinical trials on thousands of people. The TGA rigorously assesses all vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness. The approvals are subject to certain strict conditions, such as the requirement for sponsors to continue providing information to the TGA on longer term efficacy and safety from ongoing clinical trials and post-market assessment. Emerging clinical trial evidence, as well as real world data continues to be monitored by technical experts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Results for Phase 3 clinical trials of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines have been published in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals (The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine). These trials, involving tens of thousands of participants, have shown that these two vaccines are effective in preventing people from developing symptomatic COVID-19 and protect individuals against severe disease.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA' s vaccine approval process ensures that the vaccines are both safe, and provide protection against serious illness. As more information becomes available through expert medical advice and complete data sets from clinical trials, my Department will provide timely updates through its channels, including its own social media channels and those of partners and stakeholders. My Department is working in collaboration with Commonwealth, state and territory governments to identify and address any issues that arise, and provide accurate and timely information to Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can be confident that the safety of the Australian population has always been the Government' s highest priority. Following the advice of the health experts throughout the entire COVID-19 pandemic has kept us safe; likewise, this latest update helps to balance risks and protect the whole community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As supply of COVID-19 vaccines increases later this year, access to the Pfizer vaccine will be expanded to additional groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You can keep up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccine developments on my Department's website at: www.health.gov.au, and use the COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility Checker to find out where and when you can receive a COVID-19 vaccine at: covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/eligibility.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 21 June 2021 enclosing Petition EN2631 concerning overseas travel for people to see family and friends.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, Australia's current travel restriction policy has played a key foundational role underpinning management of COVID-19's impact on public health in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges this is a challenging and difficult time for Australians who are separated from their loved ones. However, the travel restrictions are in place to protect Australians from the health risks posed to the broader Australian community by discretionary international travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You can be assured that the Government regularly reviews Australia's travel restrictions policy as national and global circumstances in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic evolve, and continues to take a strong and decisive approach in responding to COVID-19, informed by expert health advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with this approach, on 2 July 2021, the National Cabinet agreed to formulate a <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response</span> which outlines Australia's pathway out of the COVID-19 pandemic from its current pre-vaccination settings to post vaccination settings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As outlined in this plan, easing travel restrictions and opening of international borders will be a phased approach triggered by expert advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It must, however, be noted that the National Cabinet also agreed to temporarily reduce the current international passenger arrival caps to manage the pressure on state and territory administered quarantine facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, it is imperative that while the current restrictions remain in effect, international travel to and from Australia is limited for exceptional circumstances as per the current exemption categories, noting that Australian citizens and permanent residents do not need an exemption to travel back to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is open to individuals who are not automatically exempt from the travel restrictions, but have a compelling reason to travel, to submit a travel exemption request for an assessment against the exemption categories outlined on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information on travel exemptions is available on the Department's website at: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au. These measures are temporary and reviewed regularly.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN2631 to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Karen Andrews MP, concerning petition EN2642 calling on the Australian Government to lift the ban on cruise ships to enable the resumption of cruises in Australia. This matter has been referred to me as the Minister for Health and Aged Care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the contribution the cruise industry makes to the Australian economy, and the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the industry and the broader tourism sector, particularly in regional areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The human biosecurity emergency period, including the cruise ship ban, is currently in place until 17 September 2021. These restrictions are based on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and can be amended or removed at any time based on the AHPPC's expert medical advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Health considerations will continue to guide this process. Above all, the AHPPC will need to be assured that cruise ships can operate in a COVID-safe way and that the risk of outbreak events is acceptably low before increased cruise operations will be permitted in Australian waters. This will be consistent with the broader relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions both domestic and international.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to work closely with the cruise industry and with state and territory governments on the timing of a cruise restart. Australian Government agencies are also working to ensure that any return to cruise operations meets community expectations regarding the safety of guests, crew and the broader community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International border control measures have been integral to Australia's success in slowing the transmission of COVID-19. The welcome interest by other foreign partners in reconnecting international travel links with Australia also reflects confidence in our public health responses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ongoing consideration is being given to when and how to reopen Australia's borders to certain economies and/or cohorts of travellers. This includes exploring arrangements with interested parties, including Taiwan, when it is safe to do so. Currently, there are no imminent plans to announce a 'travel bubble' with Taiwan. Anyone wishing to travel will still need to comply with the respective immigration and quarantine policies in place at the time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the economic benefits that more open international travel would bring, however, it must be gradual, and underpinned by the latest health advice and our domestic capacity to manage international arrivals.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 June 2021 regarding House of Representatives Petition EN2646 requesting that the House of Representatives abolish the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which was presented to the House of Representatives on 21 June 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AAT is an independent statutory body established to provide an independent merits review process. The AAT is legislated to pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of merits review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Merits review is an integral part of ensuring good governance, accountability and transparency in public administration and contributes more broadly to better administrative decision making. External merits review, undertaken by skilled independent members, facilitates tribunals to reach the correct or preferable decision.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no intention of abolishing the AAT. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 concerning petition EN2651 support for the distressed Indian community and withdrawal of penalties associated with Indian travel ban.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Helping Australians return remains a key priority for the Australian Government. However, Australia must carefully balance the interests of Australians seeking to return while managing the risk to public health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The temporary pause on flights from India was a difficult but necessary decision, based on medical expert advice, to protect Australian communities after India was identified as a high-risk country due to the significant increase in positive case numbers in managed quarantine facilities in returned travellers from India. It was not in any way motivated by racism.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties provided for breach of Australia' s biosecurity laws reflect the significance of the risks posed by COVID-19 and the need to protect the integrity of our borders. Since the pause on flights from India commenced, there has been a sustained reduction in COVID-19 positive cases originating from India in Australia's quarantine system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's methodology for monitoring the status of quarantine capacity relies on assessment of the proportion of cases among international arrivals by jurisdiction and identification of potentially high-risk arrival countries. This methodology prompts consideration of adjustments to the number of international arrivals, including by country, to ensure the number of cases in quarantine settings in Australia or any jurisdiction is maintained at manageable levels. It also supports the implementation of public health measures that are proportionate to risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recent events in some Australian states and territories demonstrate the effect of incursions of COVID-19 into the community. Continuing to limit the number of infected travellers arriving from high-risk countries helped minimise the chances of transmission events, including into the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Biosecurity Determination, made under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Biosecurity Act 2015</span> temporarily suspended flights into Australia from India for 14 days and ceased on 15 May 2021. Since March 2020, around 22,800 Australians registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have returned from India, of which over 8,000 were directly assisted on 50 facilitated flights from India. Further facilitated flights from India have been scheduled in the coming weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a close friend and comprehensive strategic partner, Australia stands with India as it battles this humanitarian crisis and continues to provide emergency medical supplies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 concerning Petition EN2657 seeking changes to the arrangements for the prescription of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a priority of the Australian Government to provide all Australians access to safe, effective and affordable medicines. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a funding program that enables Australians to access medicines at a subsidised cost in the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 June 2020, the PBS listings for opioid medications underwent a number of changes as recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). These were recommended in response to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's regulatory reforms implemented to minimise the harms caused by opioid prescription medicines to Australians each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The opioid reforms are vital to prevent inappropriate prescribing as well as reducing the risk of dependence and overdose. Over the past decade, Australians have experienced a significant increase in the level of harm and deaths arising from the use of pharmaceutical opioids. Every day in Australia, nearly 150 hospitalisations and 14 emergency department admissions involve issues relating to opioid use, and three people die from the harm that results from inappropriate use. More information is available at: www.aihw.gov.au/reports/illicit-use-of-drugs/opioid-harm-in-australia/contents/summary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">PBS-subsidised opioids can continue to be prescribed for the treatment of patients with chronic pain, provided other analgesic medications do not, or will not provide sufficient pain management, or where other analgesic medications are contraindicated or not tolerated.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prescribers are able to request authority approval from Services Australia for increased quantities and or repeats of PBS-subsidised opioids. These increases may extend treatment up to three months supply per prescription.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients requiring authority for increased PBS-subsidised quantities and repeats must have an annual review of their condition conducted by a second medical practitioner to confirm ongoing need for opioid medication when they have been receiving treatment with opioids for 12 months or longer. This secondary consult is an annual requirement only where increased quantities and or repeats of opioid medication are required. The annual review does not need to be undertaken by a pain specialist; any Australian registered medical practitioner can perform the review. In recognition of the difficulties for patients to see their doctors due to COVID-19, the secondary review may also be undertaken by phone or telehealth consultation where appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the implementation of these changes, the PBAC considered feedback from Palliative Care Australia expressing concerns regarding barriers to pain management for palliative care patients. The PBAC subsequently recommended additional changes to PBS opioid listings for palliative care patients and restructured the existing opioid restrictions to reduce the administrative burden on prescribers. These changes were implemented on 1 October 2020.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, on 1 June 2021 a number of changes to the listings of opioid medicines on the PBS Palliative Care Schedule (PCS) were implemented. These included the addition of a number of opioids and new formulations of existing opioids to the PCS, listing high maximum supply quantities and repeats to accommodate dosing variations in the palliative care setting, amending PCS listings to exempt palliative care patients (accessing opioids through the PCS listings) in all circumstances from needing to undertake annual review for access to increased quantities and repeats.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that neither I nor my Department have imposed any restrictions on doctors relating to the prescribing of opioid analgesics. It is acknowledged that determining whether opioid analgesics are an appropriate treatment for a patient is a clinical decision that most appropriately rests with their treating doctor. Further, while PBS listings may reflect the current clinical guidelines,- and the availability of a PBS subsidy may influence prescribing behaviour, it is not a mechanism through which the prescribing practices of medical practitioners are regulated. Rather, the PBS promotes the precepts of 'good medical practice' and it is expected that prescribers take responsibility for all aspects of patient care, including safe and appropriate dose reduction or changes in therapy where appropriate, and referring their patient to additional pain services to support this process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 21 June 2021 concerning petition EN2658 presented in the House of Representatives on prescribing of medical cannabis under an executive approval form.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The concerns raised and the distress experienced by the petitioner and their family is acknowledged.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As way of background, it is the policy of the Australian Government to treat medicinal cannabis products as medicines. Consequently, they are subject to the same regulatory framework and strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy as all other medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At present, two medicinal cannabis products are included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as prescription medicines. All other medicinal cannabis products are considered 'unapproved' medicines. Any Australian medical practitioner can apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) via the Special Access Scheme (SAS) or the Authorised Prescriber pathway to prescribe unapproved products including medicinal cannabis if they feel it is appropriate for their patient. Whilst it is unclear which executive approval form is being referenced in the petition, it is likely the SAS form, required by the TGA to be completed by a health practitioner to treat a patient with an unapproved drug.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note concern about the prescribing of unapproved medicinal cannabis products for chronic medical conditions. Please note, it is the view of the Government that doctors are best placed to determine the needs of their individual patients with respect to use of an unapproved medicine, having considered the risks and benefits of the medicinal cannabis product and the evidence to support its use for a particular patient in their specific circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are no restrictions on the medical conditions for which a medical practitioner may apply to access an unapproved medicinal cannabis product for their patient, provided the prescriber has the appropriate knowledge of the condition being treated and of the medicinal cannabis product they wish to prescribe. In making the application, the doctor will need to supply sufficient clinical justification that supports the use of medicinal cannabis for the particular symptom or condition. It is expected that prescribers will have considered all clinically appropriate treatment options that are included in the ARTG before applying to access an unapproved medicinal cannabis product for their patient under the SAS. The application is also reviewed by a professional at the TGA. The criteria for determining whether or not to approve access are detailed in our guidance document 'Special Access Scheme: Guidance for health practitioners and sponsors' available at: </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of registration with the Medical Board of Australia, doctors are required to adhere to principles of Good Medical Practice. Doctors are expected to educate themselves with all available relevant information relating to an unapproved therapeutic good before prescribing it. Medico-legal responsibility for prescribing an unapproved product rests with the prescriber. The prescriber and the patient, patient's parents or guardian accept responsibility for any adverse consequence of therapy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Concerns about clinical practice issues are a matter for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), which has a formal complaints process in place for members of the public to raise concerns about the performance of registered health practitioners. Further information on this process is available on the Ahpra website at: www.ahpra.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the TGA has an important role in monitoring the safety of unapproved medicines and continually encourages consumers and health professionals to report any suspected adverse events involving medicinal cannabis. Reporting adverse events helps the TGA to build a profile of the safety of a medicine. Significant safety concerns are investigated as part of ensuring product safety in the Australian community.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Determination commenced on 3 May 2021 and remained in force until 15 May 2021. The Determination was a temporary measure designed to reduce the number of COVID-19 positive individuals in quarantine in Australia, who had acquired their infection while in India, to a level that can be safely managed by Australia's health system and quarantine capacity. This was a difficult but necessary decision, based on expert medical advice, to protect the Australian community.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 June 2021 regarding the House of Representatives Petition EN2670, request to revoke clause for benefit of employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Fair Work industrial relations framework, parties who made agreements in good faith under previous legislative frameworks are able to rely on those agreements. As a result, agreements continue to operate until they are terminated or replaced.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, on 9 December 2021, the Australian Government introduced the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021 into the Parliament. As introduced , the Bill included provisions that would have terminated pre-Fair Work Act agreements that are still in operation on 1 July 2022, which would include the agreement that is the subject of this petition. These provisions were removed from the Bill by the Senate. It is disappointing that Labor opposed the Government's measured and sensible reforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government remains committed to making enterprise bargaining easier and quicker and remains committed to the broader package of reforms to improve the enterprise bargaining framework.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Pursuant to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009</span> and the related transitional provisions, parties to an agreement, including employees, may apply to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) to terminate an agreement which has passed its nominal expiry date. Where an application for termination is approved by the FWC, employees would then in most cases become entitled to the pay and conditions in the relevant modern award.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 21 June 2021, on behalf of the signatory of petition PN0506, concerning the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of the ABC and the role it plays in contributing to a sense of national identity, informing and entertaining audiences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC has more funding certainty than any other media organisation in Australia. Taxpayers provide the ABC with more than $1 billion in funding every year. This is a substantial investment of public funds in our national broadcaster to enable it to provide television, radio and digital media services in line with its Charter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is not true that the ABC's budget has been cut. ABC funding is locked in for the current three year period or triennium (2019-20 to 2021-22) and rises each year within that period. In the 2019-20 Federal Budget the ABC received a further $43.7 million for regional and local newsgathering.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provided funding to the ABC of $1,046 million in 2018-19; in the three years of the current triennium, the ABC is receiving $1,062 million (2019-20); $1,065 million (2020-21); and $1,070 million (2021-22). These figures are set out in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications 2021-22 Portfolio Budget Statement, May 2021, on page 138. Far from a cut, the funding rises each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All media organisations are operating in a tough environment - the ABC is not immune. Audience tastes are changing, and new technology and competition from international streaming platforms has transformed viewing habits. Australian media companies are responding to this challenging environment in a variety of innovative ways to reduce the cost of broadcasting infrastructure and back office services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983</span> (ABC Act), the ABC has a responsibility to operate efficiently and to deliver the best possible outcomes for all Australians. It is important that the ABC demonstrates to the Australian people that they are managing the Corporation with a clear strategy that aligns with its Charter and are deploying their resources efficiently.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2018 National Broadcasters Efficiency Review found that the national broadcasters could achieve cost efficiencies in a number of areas including by focusing on core business, modernising work practices, and increasing collaboration and sharing. The petitioner can read the report here: </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The content and operational independence of the ABC is enshrined in legislation. Parliament has guaranteed this independence so that the ABC's decisions are free of political interference. Under this arrangement, how the ABC spends the money allocated to it is a matter for the ABC Board and Executive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to my attention. I hope the information in this letter is of some help.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This quote is oft-misattributed to Mahatma Ghandi but is directly applicable to the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021 before us today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To protect its most vulnerable, in 1990, Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which, according to the Australian Child Rights Taskforce, 'means that Australia has a duty to ensure that all children in Australia enjoy these rights'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Article 6 of the convention commits Australia to recognising that every child has the inherent right to life; and ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Article 24 of the convention commits Australia to recognising the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. Our nation has signed up to striving to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services. Further, Article 24 says Australia shall take appropriate measures to diminish infant and child mortality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, Australia has committed to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, in this nation, potentially hundreds of babies are born alive as a result of abortion procedures without any significant subsequent intervention. Our most vulnerable are simply left to die. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The data is sketchy with no information available from most states but a research paper that I asked the Parliamentary Library to undertake found that in a single year, 33 babies aborted after 20 weeks gestation were born alive in Victoria while, in Queensland, 204 babies were born alive as a result of abortions over a 10-year period. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in Queensland, the problem is systemic with Queensland Health's Clinical Guidelines for Termination of Pregnancy stating: 'If [during an abortion] a live birth occurs… Do not provide life sustaining treatment… Document the time and date of death.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How is this policy, how are these deaths, in accordance with our international obligation as a nation to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we treating our most vulnerable members and what does it say about our nation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: I am pro-life. I think abortion is an evil and it results in a death of a child and often ongoing mental harm for a parent. I would rather no child be aborted in this country or elsewhere. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But whether you are pro-life or so-called pro-choice, I do not know that anyone but the most cold-blooded sociopath could say that a child born alive is not a child and thus does not have any rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021 seeks to use our constitutional external affairs power to address the fact that we have policies and practices across the country that result in us breaching our international obligations and that result in the lives of babies unnecessarily being lost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does so by placing a duty of care on medical practitioners to provide exactly the same medical care and treatment to a child born alive as a result of an abortion as they would a child born in any other circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, breaching that duty would incur a penalty and there is a new obligation for medical practitioners to report to the federal department of health on children born alive as a result of abortions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A survey conducted by the recognised polling company YouGov just last month demonstrated that support for my bill is extremely strong across all sectors of the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings send a very clear message.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than three times as many people support care for these babies rather than oppose care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of people expect any baby should be afforded medical care, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The survey shows that view is held by both coalition and Labor voters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That view is held by people aged 18 to 34 and those aged over 65.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a view shared by both men and women, and those living in the inner city and the outer regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have tried to claim—quite falsely—that this bill would require doctors, under threat of penalty, to keep non-viable babies alive. This is not true. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 9 of the bill states that the medical care and treatment to be provided to a baby born alive as a result of an abortion to be commensurate to the circumstances, not including the fact that they were born as a result of a termination, and goes on to state that this could be life-saving treatment or, indeed, palliative care as the case may be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have said this bill would keep babies alive that have congenital deformities. Well, again, only if the baby was viable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And if the baby was viable but had congenital deformities, which is another way of saying the baby was born with disabilities, what is the problem? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are people saying that children born with disabilities should be left to die? That is a very dark road indeed that I will never be taking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have claimed that this bill perpetuates a myth that children are born alive a result of abortions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the available data I garnered via the Parliamentary Library shows that to be a false claim, but even if that claim was correct—which it is not—what harm would this bill actually do? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If no viable child is ever born alive as a result of an abortion then this bill has no effect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if one child, just one, was born alive in such circumstances and that child was viable then this bill would not only have an effect but it would be more important than probably most laws on the books because it would save a life that otherwise would have been discarded like it was medical waste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is there is little to argue against in this bill, unless of course an objector felt that a baby born alive as a result of an abortion should be left to die because it was born as a result of an abortion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a position would be in contravention of our international obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this goes to the constitutionality of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have said that abortion is a state issue but when it comes to providing medical treatment and care to a child and sustaining the life of a child that is a federal matter by virtue of the external affairs power of section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia and the fact that the Commonwealth of Australia is signatory to article 6 and article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there has been some speculation that the bill could breach civil medical conscription provisions inherent in section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, I have sought expert opinion from constitutional lawyers courtesy of the Human Rights Law Alliance who have concluded: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our opinion is that there is no Constitutional impediment to the Bill as it does not constitute civil conscription. Specifically:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… We think that, properly considered, the Bill would not be characterised as a law with respect to 'the provision of … medical and dental services' within the meaning of s(ection) 51(xxiiiA), and that the civil conscription provision therefore would not apply to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Even if the civil conscription prohibition did apply to the Bill, we consider that the Bill, if enacted, would not 'authorise any form of civil conscription' due to its conformity with Australia's international human rights obligations, and therefore would not be unconstitutional for breaching the civil conscription prohibition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is constitutional and could pass this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is perhaps not constitutional are the deaths of viable babies occurring as a result of abortions across this country. </span>
                </p>

Even if a student chooses to take out a HECS-HELP loan, that money has to be paid back eventually. The last thing we as a government want is for a young person to rack up a three- to four-year university debt and graduate with a degree that has very little likelihood of helping them find work. That debt can follow a person around for years or even decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want to reduce the chances of having skills shortages now and in the future, particularly in emerging industries. We want our university graduates to have the best chance of getting work once their studies have been completed, and the way to do that is to steer them towards studying for industries that need workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One way to entice people into these programs is by lowering their cost. Under the Job-ready Graduates Package the cost of an agriculture degree is down by 59 per cent. The cost of a maths degree is also down by 59 per cent. The cost of a nursing or teaching degree has gone down by 42 per cent. The cost of a science, engineering or IT degree has gone down by 18 per cent. Importantly, we are already seeing evidence that the Job-ready Graduates Package is getting more Australians into the degree that will get them the skills and qualifications they require in order to get a job. In fact, the data from our universities has shown that the largest increases in new university enrolments are for courses in these in-demand fields. The University of Queensland has offered double the number of places in its agriculture program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Longman, the University of the Sunshine Coast, with campuses at Caboolture and Petrie, offers a wide range of these key programs right on our doorstep. In fact, more Australians are now studying the courses that will give them the best chance of getting into a job. Commencements are up 14 per cent in science, 13 per cent in IT, 10 per cent in engineering, 14 per cent in agriculture, 11 per cent in education and eight per cent in health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing a record $20.4 billion investment in higher education in 2021, while funding is up more than 37 per cent since we came to government. We are now seeing the results of our policies. Australia's unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9 per cent under the Morrison government, which is the lowest it has been in a decade. Youth unemployment is at its lowest rate in 12 years. I am so pleased that a commonsense approach has been used and that university funding is now demand driven, rather than the old model where students were graduating and in some cases were never able to use the degree they worked so hard for, as there were no jobs in that field. This government will continue to back Australians to get into a job now and into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  The convention on these things is to thank the member for Longman for bringing on the debate and to say how pleased I am that he has done it, but I'd be a hypocrite if I did that. The fact is that this is the most antiuniversity government in Australian history. It is bizarre that the member would bring on a motion praising the government's university policies. He should hang his head in shame for the way in which this government has treated universities. Universities are vital to Australia's future. Attending university boosts earnings by around 50 per cent compared to finishing high school, translating to some $600,000 of additional earnings for the median woman and $800,000 for the median man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are also critical to Australia's exports. They were our fourth-largest export earner before the pandemic hit. Universities employ some 130,000 full-time equivalent workers, and in regional areas they support some 14,000 jobs. The research done in universities is fundamental to Australia's prosperity, and at a time like this even those opposite should recognise the value of funding science. Yet the sector is set to lose nearly $4 billion in revenue in 2020 and 2021. The mere $1 billion the government provided in last year's budget hasn't been renewed in this year's, and when it came to JobKeeper the government changed the rules three times to keep out universities. No, wait; it wasn't all universities. No, they let a couple through. Who did they let through? It was the private universities. Bond University got millions of dollars and New York University's Sydney campus got JobKeeper, yet Australian public universities were excluded from JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's own budget papers show that, because of the Job-ready Graduates Package, Commonwealth funding of universities will be lower and student debt will rise. The fact is that this comes after an ongoing series of attacks by the Morrison government on universities. They killed the demand driven system, bringing back command and control by the Molonglo. You'd think that a party that calls itself Liberal might actually support the demand driven system which allows students to decide where places will be, but, no, they went back to command and control. They botched the China relationship, causing significant challenges for Australia's higher education sector. Then, as a result of their bungles in vaccination and quarantine they are further hurting the higher education sector—not just because international students can't come, but because domestic students are caught interstate and because valued faculty can't be brought here to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go through a couple of the particular universities. Charles Sturt University is having to cut bachelor degrees in outdoor education, sustainable agriculture and information technology. Macquarie University is having to cut up to 31 programs in science and engineering. The University of Newcastle is cutting eight undergraduate degrees, including in technology, renewable energy systems and computer science. Swinburne University of Technology is cutting design and languages programs. Central Queensland University is closing campuses. The University of the Sunshine Coast is cutting programs in STEM. The University of Queensland is cutting programs in agriculture and engineering. Murdoch University is cutting programs in physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and engineering. Across all institutions we've had nearly 2,000 courses cancelled and nearly 200 programs cancelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At my former university, the Australian National University, the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences, which has done groundbreaking work in plate tectonics, has lost five professors. ANU's physics department, clearly the best in Australia, has lost 20 professorial positions and 40 per cent of PhD students. This is despite the fact that it is one of the most successful centres at research commercialisation. Deakin University has lost nearly 3,000 staff. La Trobe University has lost over 3,000 staff. Monash University has lost 1,000 staff. The Australian National University has literally been decimated—one in 10 staff have gone. Of course, these are only the numbers that the National Tertiary Education Union can pull out. ABS data shows 30,000 fewer Australians working in higher education than at the start of the year. Even the philistines believed in the humanities—in arts, culture, trade and languages—but not this government, the most anti-university government in Australia's history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I would like to outline to all Australians that the fact is that one of the biggest threats facing our nation's economic recovery is a shortage of skills—a shortage of skills in the right places. During this global pandemic, businesses cannot rely on building a bigger workforce from overseas or from immigration. These levers can no longer be pulled by government at this time to supply workforces that Australian businesses have historically relied upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government's economic plan is delivering jobs for Australians and is skilling the next generation of workers. The Job-ready Graduates Package is part of that plan. Australia will bounce back from COVID-19 through developing our country's greatest asset and our greatest resource: our own people. That's why we have seen the development of this government's Job-ready Graduates Package, to ensure more Australians study in the areas that will get them the skills and qualifications to get a job and to have a career and a future in Australia's jobs market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently released the national skills priority list through the National Skills Commission. This is the national picture of jobs in demand today and into the future. Today, over 150 occupations face skill shortages nationally. These are most commonly technicians and trades, followed by professionals; machinery operators and drivers; and managers, as well as community and personal service workers. But we're also seeing huge demand for accountants, auditors and engineers—all areas that our Job-ready Graduates Package is designed to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest data shows there are more Australians studying at university than ever before. Importantly, more Australians are studying the courses that are likely to get them jobs. Commencements are up. I thank the member for Longman for putting forward this motion and I reiterate the numbers that he outlined: science is up 14 per cent; agriculture is up 14 per cent; IT is up 13 per cent; engineering is up 10 per cent; education is up 11 per cent; and health is up eight per cent. These are all areas of demand in jobs. The Job-ready Graduates Package is creating up to 30,000 additional university places in 2021, up to 100,000 places by 2030, and bringing down the cost of degrees in these key future jobs areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline a few of the areas where degrees have actually come down in cost under this Job-ready Graduates Package: agriculture is down 59 per cent; maths is down 59 per cent; nursing and teaching has gone down 42 per cent; and the cost of a science, engineering or IT degree has gone down 18 per cent. According to universities and tertiary access centres, new commencements are actually up 7.3 per cent. The University of Queensland has offered double the number of places in agriculture. That doesn't agree with what the member for Fenner just outlined in this chamber. Nationally, in 2021, enrolments in science are up 6,200 and enrolments in engineering are up 2,200. The Job-ready Graduates Package is working. For example, ANU has increased enrolments in both science and engineering degrees in 2021. The number of commencing science students increased by 32 per cent, and the number of commencing engineering students increased by 66 per cent, compared to 2020. Nobody can argue that these areas are not areas of demand now and into the decades ahead of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is investing $903.5 million over four years for more places and more support for more students. In the 2020 budget there was $298.5 million in additional funding for undergraduate places this year. There was $252 million for up to 50,000 additional short-course places and $1 billion to back university research during the pandemic. This government's policies have already seen the youth unemployment rate at the lowest level in 12 years, according to the April 2021 figures. We'll continue to back young Australians to get them into work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While right now on the Gold Coast we're hurting in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our best days lie ahead of us. In my electorate of Moncrieff, in the middle of the nation's playground on the Gold Coast, we're seeing a boom in opportunities that will deliver jobs to support our growth and development, as well as our vibrant local economy. But we're also seeing the sorts of shortages the nationals skills priority list has identified. If we're going to realise that future, we're going to need more workers with the right skills and the right education. On the Gold Coast, we need more skilled and trained people to help build the Gold Coast and grow our local economy. That's what this package does.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on the motion moved by the Member for Longman—a motion erroneously claiming that the Morrison government's Job-ready Graduates Package is getting more Australians into degrees, providing skills and qualifications to obtain employment, and that there are more Australians studying at university than ever before. Let's pick the coalition claims apart one at a time. You might remember that the job-ready graduates legislation was touted by the Morrison government as a measure to redirect university enrolments to areas of study linked to jobs that are in demand in the labour market. It is a fine concept, but the actual effect of the legislation was quite different. The coalition have actually increased the student fee load and cut funding from the Commonwealth to universities. Treasurer Frydenberg gets the savings, and students get a pile of debt. Many students are paying more for their degrees; on average, Australian students are paying seven per cent more, and 40 per cent of students have seen fees for their degree double. Students in humanities, commerce and communication degrees have all been forced to pay more and rack up more debt to obtain their degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government doesn't believe graduates of those degrees are employable, but I would argue there are valuable skillsets among those graduates—in fact, the data doesn't back up the government's basis for the legislation. The Universities Australia Chief Executive Catriona Jackson was quoted saying in August last year that, in 2020, the overall employment rate for humanities, culture and social sciences was 87 per cent. That was three years after completing their degree and was the same rate for science and mathematics degrees. We know from the Morrison government's own budget papers that funding for Australian universities will fall by 10 per cent over the next three years—nothing to celebrate. If that weren't bad enough on its own, it comes at a time when $1 billion in emergency funding to support research jobs has been cut off and universities are facing a projected revenue loss of $16 billion from international students being locked out. Because of the job-ready graduates legislation, some universities have been forced to abolish courses such as neuroscience, arts, education, maths and Asian languages—courses which would create skills crucial to Australia's recovery from the pandemic recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the claims made in the motion by the member for Longman, that 'there are more Australians studying at university than ever before' and that 'the largest increases in new enrolments are for courses made cheaper by the Job-ready Graduates Package'. Data in March this year did show an increase in enrolments in 2021 compared to 2020, but the linking of that increase in enrolments to the Job-ready Graduates Package has been debunked by education experts. Professor Andrew Norton is a higher education policy expert from the ANU. He was quoted in March as saying 'the increase was more likely to result from the announcement last November of 12,000 priority places', which allowed universities to go over their caps, 'and the 50,000 government subsidised short courses.' He said, 'The cause is not the job ready graduates program, and the increase will not be sustained beyond 2021.' Professor Norton is not the only expert to disagree with the idea that the increased enrolments come from the job-ready graduates legislation. Professor Paddy Nixon, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Canberra, also was quoted earlier this year as saying that a surge in enrolments at his university in the bachelors of nursing and medical imaging programs was unlikely to be a result of the legislation. Professor Nixon said, 'The surge in these enrolments was unsurprising, given the pandemic.' He said, 'My theory would be that the salience of nursing and health generally is that these areas are in the minds of many people, and so would attract more applicants than previously.' Professor Norton pointed out also that 'the effect of the job ready graduates legislation is that universities don't generate more money by taking on more students'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has cut real funding for universities during a pandemic. On top of that, it deliberately and methodically changed the rules three times so universities could not get JobKeeper to keep their staff employed. At least 17,300 university jobs were lost in 2020, and university revenue fell by $1.8 billion compared to 2019. International education was worth more than $17 billion to Australia's economy. Immediately before the pandemic it was our fourth-largest export after iron ore, coal and gas—all products that are not value added, I'd point out. If the Prime Minister had done his job—if the Prime Minister had provided quarantine facilities and had bothered to order enough vaccination for all Australians—we would not still have more than 35,000 Australian stuck overseas, and international students could return. He might then might deserve a pat on the back. Legislation that makes it harder and more expensive for students to go to university does not require a pat on the back. I point that out to the member for Longman. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great privilege to be able to move this motion in this chamber, Mr Speaker, because as you and I and other members in this chamber know, one of the foundation pillars of being a Liberal is a sense of responsibility to ourselves and to each other—as well as to our environment, to steward it for future generations. A critical part of this is the challenge of waste and resource management. In fact, one of the reasons why I am a free-marketeer is that I believe in the efficient use of the world's scarce resources. The way to do that is through the utilisation and repurposing of waste and making it valuable, as part of a circular economy, so that people want to use it and re-use it and not needlessly diminish the world's scarce resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the challenge of doing that is making sure that government measures are there to support and incentivise the efficient use of the world's scarce resources: to repurpose them, reuse them, make sure they have a continued life and value-add to the Australian community and economy and stop the diminution of other resources into the future. That's why the Commonwealth government, the Morrison government, has made such a strong priority of Australia's waste and recycling industries, particularly, of course, from the leadership of the Prime Minister but also from the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, the member for Brisbane, who has made this a core part of his work. We congratulate him as well for his contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia currently generates 2.94 million tonnes of waste each year, 60 per cent of which is recycled and the rest thrown away, ending up in landfill; being sent overseas, often, to be burnt; or in our ocean. Plastic pollution is choking our precious waterways. In just 30 years time there'll be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This is why we are so strongly committed to practical pathways that address recycling and reduce the amount of waste that goes into the ocean, including through the billion-dollar transformation of our waste and recycling industry, which includes $190 million for our Recycling Modernisation Fund to leverage over $600 million of recycling infrastructure to sort, process and remanufacture waste materials. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many members will know, previously Australia has, as many countries have, simply exported our waste for a fee. Now we are taking responsibility for it, as we should. There is $100 million for the Australian Recycling Investment Fund, for products using clean energy technologies to support recycling. There is $49.4 million to help halve Australia's food waste by 2030. I know that my own local councils Bayside and Glen Eira are investing significantly in what they call FOGO to make sure there's a reduction in food waste, including the regularised pick-up, I understand, from next year of food and garden waste, with landfill waste pick-ups reduced to every second week to try and incentivise and encourage households to do the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the National Waste Policy Action Plan, to reduce waste, increase recycling rates and build capacity in our domestic recycling industry, including $59.6 million to the National Waste Policy Action Plan from the Commonwealth, to implement the waste export ban and to improve our waste data, because if you know the nature of the problem you can help fix it. There is $7.8 million on product stewardship for oil containers; a world-leading ban on the export of waste, plastic, paper, glass and tyres; $20 million for projects to reduce plastic waste and boost plastic recycling. At every point, we're implementing practical plans that will improve the recycling and waste management industries in this country as part of the broader framework of our environmental agenda to make sure that it's not just rhetoric but we're delivering in communities across our states and of course across the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also celebrate those people who see the opportunity and seize it, not just to take responsibility, though that is a critical part of the conversation and something that we can all do. They see how there are opportunities in waste management and recycling—companies like SomerSide, which was founded by Gabby Samkova, who I've spoken about previously in this chamber, a 27-year-old Brighton local who creates towels using recycled plastic bottles. Each towel contains around 14 used plastic bottles that would otherwise have gone into landfill. It is stories like Gabby's that highlight how enterprise can come off the back of recycling to repurpose items in a circular economy and reduce waste. There are companies like CopperRock, a waste and recycling centre that's based in Cheltenham. It is owned by John, who began his stint in the industry 23 years ago, working as skip truck driver. They have an enormous amount of experience, working with local soccer clubs and community organisations to reduce their waste footprint.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  [by video link] I'm glad to speak on this motion. The issue of waste and recycling is very important. The problem of waste in Australia, and in our world, is massive. It's also a big opportunity. We can move towards a more sustainable set of arrangements, and, by doing so, we can see new industry and new manufacturing created. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a big problem because it's a fundamentally broken market. We heard the member for Goldstein spout his credentials as a free marketeer. If you were a free marketeer and you looked at the circumstances worldwide and in Australia when it comes to waste and recycling, you'd run through all of your hankies, having a very bitter weep, because this is a profoundly broken market, where companies produce items according to a linear model, resources get used once, they get turned into things that are often disposed of after very brief use and then they get left in our environment, and the cost falls on all of us. Until we address that broken market, we're going to see more of the same. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to see a continuation of the eight million tonnes annually of plastic that goes into the ocean that accumulate in fish and birds and that is finding its way into us. We've seen nanoparticles of plastic in rainfall. We are finding plastic in species that live in the deepest ocean trenches on the planet. Until we do something about that, it's going to keep getting worse. A circular economy is a sustainable economy. It means we use the limited resources that we have better, and we need to do more of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's made a big song and dance about waste and recycling, essentially as a fig leaf to cover its failures in other areas of environmental stewardship. The member for Goldstein talks about environmental stewardship, but we've seen precious little of that from this government after three terms, three prime ministers and nine years. It presides over a failed environmental protection framework that sees more and more Australian species pushed to the edge of extinction, and it has taken no action on climate change. Along it comes with this zeal for waste and recycling, but, sadly, despite sprinkling money here and there and making announcements and talking a good game when it comes to the circular economy, it's failed when it comes to waste and recycling too. The numbers don't lie, as is always the case. Australia barely recycles 10 per cent of its plastic. That has not changed under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You think about the big pieces that need to be addressed—infrastructure on the one hand, product stewardship on the other—and there's been literally no new infrastructure created under this government to deal with processing material and recycling material for reuse. The $100 million Recycling Investment Fund that the member for Goldstein mentioned didn't advance a single dollar until just recently, and then it only advanced funds for a project that was already going ahead. None of the new infrastructure facilities that have been agreed with the states and territories have been delivered. There have been no new co-regulatory product stewardship schemes. If you look at something like APCO, a voluntary scheme, it hasn't even been accredited yet. It has targets, like trying to achieve 20 per cent incorporation of recycled material into plastic packaging by 2025. Twenty per cent is its target, and where we sitting now? We're sitting at four per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing abysmally when it comes to these things, because the government has essentially been late to the game. It's taken a hands-off approach. Its initiatives have failed. The funding mechanisms have not seen a dollar landed. We've switched off the exporting of mixed plastics, which is a good thing, but it was forced on us by the decision of other countries that they would no longer take our low-quality waste. The reality is: we've got nowhere for that 75,000 tonnes of mixed plastics to go. If you talk to people in the industry at the moment, they will tell you quite openly that those mixed plastics are going into landfill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government that crows about what it's done when it comes to waste and recycling. What it's done is recognised the realities internationally when it comes to not being able to send our low-quality contaminated waste to be burnt or thrown into rivers in other countries. It hasn't introduced one operational piece of infrastructure yet, and mixed plastics will be going into landfill. We need less talk, fewer fig leaves, less of the tricked-up self-congratulation and more cold-eyed focus on the failures of this government when it comes to waste and recycling.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Goldstein for moving this motion today, and I'm proud to make a contribution to it. Just like him, I'm a waste warrior and I care deeply about our environment as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians won't know that the average Australian generates nearly three tonnes of waste every year and that more than a tonne of this is thrown away, relegated to landfills, sent overseas, burnt or dumped into the ocean—until now. This thing has changed in Australia. We know that almost 60 kilograms of plastic waste per person is produced each year, and that if plastic pollution continues, as it has, in 30 years our precious seas will be home to more plastic than fish. This is not a world any of us want to live in. The Morrison government unequivocally showed its support in the last budget by funding waste reduction measures, increasing recycling rates and building capacity in Australia's recycling industry. You cannot do this without industry and sector capacity. I'm proud to recall our parliamentary inquiry into our recycling industry; I encourage all to look at its final report, <span style="font-style:italic;">From rubbish to resources: building a circular economy</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and its 24 recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is driving a $1 billion transformation of the industry. Putting $190 million towards the Recycling Modernisation Fund will allow millions in infrastructure to be leveraged in order to sort, process and manufacture waste materials. Not only will this allow Australia to phase in recycling of 645,000 tonnes every year, in alignment with the Morrison government's world-leading export ban—as the Prime Minister has said, 'It's our waste, it's our responsibility'; this fund will create 10,000 new jobs over the next 10 years by expanding Australia's recycling industry and infrastructure. That translates to an increase of 32 per cent of jobs in the Australian waste and recycling sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to speak to the Australian waste conference earlier this year. All the Australian states and territories, bar Northern Territory, have Recycling Modernisation Fund agreements in place, with 52 new infrastructure projects across the country. Just one instance is in Victoria: the Morrison government has funded equipment to produce a new patented system for concrete slab foundations made from 100 per cent recycled plastic. This kind of innovation is valued by the government, and grants like this will continue as Australia phases in our waste export ban.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is establishing a Food Waste for Healthy Soils Fund to divert 3.4 million tonnes of organic material from landfill for productive use in agricultural soils. This is all about returning today's organic waste back to the soil to ensure that soil grows our food for tomorrow, and our topsoil in Australia needs this organic waste. By achieving the Morrison government's goal of 80 per cent recovery for organic waste Australia will generate $401 million in industry value and add that to the Australian economy. It will create up to 2,700 additional jobs and it will avoid over two million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has also committed $20 million towards product stewardship, whereby responsibility is shared for managing the environmental impacts of products we use every day. Gone are the days when companies can wilfully ignore their products' ongoing environmental effects. The Morrison government is committed to this, and 20 businesses have already been supported through this scheme. One of those organisations is the Australian Food and Grocery Council, which has been granted less than a million dollars to work to bring the food and grocery supply chain together to deliver a national scheme to enhance the collection and processing of plastic packaging. If you go into your supermarket you can already see these sorts of initiatives being rolled out. This will help us to recover plastics—an estimated 189,000 tonnes each year. This is about getting on with the job of helping Australia's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government understands that we need to invest in this sector and to continue to support Australian businesses which are not just innovative but future focused. That's why we're supporting small and medium-sized businesses to adopt the Australasian recycling scheme. This will help them to improve their recycling of packaging and to compete with larger businesses, and it will help Australians to be better informed about the purchase they're making and foster an attitude that's considerate of their role in the environment and our world's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This billion-dollar transformation of the recycling sector is once in a generation, and I commend the Morrison government for their leadership and investment in Australia's future—an investment that will see Australia's waste footprint fall by 10 million tonnes. It will help to protect our environment and it will help to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade. What's not to like about that?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  [by video link] There is no doubt that plastic is a huge problem that we have in Australia. It is everywhere and it is [inaudible]. We need to do more. In every school I visit in every corner of Warringah—and, I have no doubt, in every school in Australia—it is the No. 1 [inaudible]. It is always front of mind and it worries my constituents very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It really is no surprise that so many are concerned [inaudible] this global waste crisis that we have. Waste forms islands in the Pacific and it is found [inaudible] vulnerable creatures. A study published last week found that over 1,550 wildlife species have eaten plastic. It's also found in our food, on top of our mountains and on our coasts. It's everywhere. And in this pandemic we've made it worse; it hasn't helped. In 2019 the world was poised to improve our record. We were poised to shift away from single-use plastics and jurisdictions had plastic bans coming in. Unfortunately, a lot of those have been offset by the pandemic, which has forced many to pause those initiatives, and we've seen a vast surge in the use of single-use items and plastics. We've had disruption and we've seen disposable personal protective equipment, like masks, gloves and gowns, protecting from the spread of the virus. These are plastic and, whilst they're playing an important role in helping our frontline workers and communities to ward off the virus, they're having a very negative effect on our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time to futureproof our systems to deal with future influxes of plastics, which are likely to happen again and again, in line with our national circular economy goals. The Australian Council of Recycling has said that household waste production and recycling contamination has increased despite growing awareness, and business and commercial recycling has deceased. These are worrying trends. I would ask the government: where is our national campaign on encouraging people, whilst they are at home in this pandemic, to do something about their own personal use? Waste is ending up in the environment, clogging up waterways, sewerage systems and beaches, and it is choking animals. The amount of plastics use now happening is just incredible. The risks of the masks at the moment—unfortunately we're seeing them all over our environment. We've seen, unfortunately, a growth in use of take-away because, for example, here in Warringah, we're all in lockdown. Too often plastics are still being used in the packaging of foods, drinks, groceries and online shopping. We need to make sure that stops. It can only stop by behaviour change, which requires information campaigns and legislation. We require legislation to ensure we stop single-use plastics. We need to improve infrastructure to promote circularity and we need to invest in research and development, corporate action and government policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to not come to the House to congratulate itself and claim big wins when we are not even scratching the surface of what really needs to be done. We need to see leadership. This is a problem that we can't delay. We need to manage that surge in waste and also the surge in PPE waste that has come with COVID in the last 18 months. We need dedicated programs for this kind of waste. These are the kinds of things the government really should be focusing on and funding. We also need to address the broader problems of environmental management and protection. At the end of the day, this will all come back and compound.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to say that here in Warringah we have great progress being made. We have Ocean Action Pod, which is seeking to raise awareness of plastics in our ocean and the waste build-up in those areas. I've also implemented the Roadmap to Zero, which is implementing awareness and providing education to individuals, businesses and schools on how they can reduce their waste. We have great leadership in the electorate, with companies like Worn Up, which is recycling school uniforms; and BlockTexx, which is recovering polyester and cellulose from textiles in clothing, diverting textiles from landfill and using them in a more sustainable manner. We have so many companies leading the way. Government needs to do more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise today to support the government funding initiatives that will help fulfil our commitment to enhancing domestic and industrial recycling and supporting Australia's waste export ban. As a farmer, I've been conscious all my life of the need to minimise our waste, being largely responsible for its disposal on farm. Our family food scraps and organic waste usually ended up being fed to a chook who laid the eggs, or were made into compost to keep the veggie garden looking great. But inorganic waste was always a problem—tyres, oils and plastic items that would never break down in a thousand years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to commend the government on driving a $1 billion transformation of our waste and recycling industry, and in particular the budget commitments towards food and organic waste. These include the $67 million for a new food and organic garden waste initiative and establishing a Food Waste for Healthy Soils Fund to divert 3.4 million tonnes of organic material from landfill for productive use in agriculture soils. This fund complements other Australian government actions in this space, including the $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, which supports new infrastructure to sort, process and remanufacture materials such as plastics, paper, tyres and glass. As our waste export ban phases in, Australia must look at recycling some 645,000 tonnes of inorganic waste domestically. To achieve this we need additional recycling infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this juncture, I would like to update the House on a significant shovel-ready project in my electorate of O'Connor which illustrates how even small towns can dream big when it comes to recycling. The Shire of Coolgardie sits at the crossroads of two major transport routes in my electorate and is perfectly positioned to receive waste from a vast catchment area. The north-south railway line carries minerals over 600 kilometres from the Northern Goldfields via Kalgoorlie and Norseman to the Esperance port. The east-west national highway is the main road freight route from Perth to Adelaide and onwards to the eastern states. The Shire of Coolgardie has capitalised on geographical and logistical opportunities to propose a waste recycling hub that will process the huge volumes of plastics, tyres and conveyor belt rubber created by mining operations in the greater Goldfields region and beyond. In addition, they plan to process household and other waste backloaded from Perth, Esperance and potentially further afield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with the Shire of Coolgardie on numerous occasions, and they are enthusiastic about creating an integrated waste sorting and processing facility at their class-3 landfill site. They have advanced plans for a pilot plastics and tyre pyrolysis plant, which will convert 98 per cent of the total waste to energy-rich fuel and by-products without harmful burning or emissions. To this end, they have established a memorandum of understanding with some of Australia's biggest miners in the Central Goldfields region, which produce minerals to the value of over $6.8 billion. The Shire of Coolgardie alone represents the largest mineral value, comprising $3.4 billion. Furthermore, this has enabled the shire to enter into negotiations with Circular Economy Alliance Australia to create a circular economy hub linked to the soon to be established Global Centre of Excellence in Circular Economy. The shire also has in-principle agreements with the Shire of Esperance and the eastern metropolitan group of local government authorities in Perth to sort and process commercial and industrial waste in Coolgardie which would otherwise be destined for local landfill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, WA trucks approximately 30,000 tonnes of unwanted plastics to South Australia for processing. The most recent update from the shire indicates they are fast-tracking their tyre and plastic pyrolysis plant, having received multiple responses to their expressions of interest regarding the most appropriate technologies from across the world. They have also gone to tender for a tyre shredder. In the near future, I see this innovative shire using large volumes of industrial waste to create syngas and diesel, a by-product that is truly carbon free and marketable to industry. Other by-products from the tyre and plastic pyrolysis plant will be used by the shire for road building into one of their local Aboriginal communities. Finally, the shire hope to mobilise their local unskilled labour force, providing training and employment opportunities particularly for their indigenous community members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Shire of Coolgardie for their vision and passion for this transformational project and acknowledge the enormous work done on this project by the executive team, led by CEO James Trail. My commitment to Coolgardie is to work with Assistant Minister Evans to ensure that this project, which is so vital to the entire Goldfields region, receives the necessary support to get it off the ground.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  [by video link] [inaudible] over substance. Why you'd want to move a motion in an area where you've had abject failure is beyond me, and that is exactly what has occurred with this Morrison government and improving recycling in Australia. They have been a massive failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of other nations' decisions to stop accepting Australia's recycled material, I had a meeting with a recycling officer at a local council in the area that I represent. I asked that officer where most of the material that we put into our yellow recycling bins is now going if China, Indonesia and other nations are no longer accepting our recycling material. The answer horrified me. The council officer said that most of it just goes into landfill. When the Australian people go out of their way to sort their recycled materials—to put them into the yellow recycling bins, which are accepted and picked up on a separate basis to our other waste—they expect that that material is actually going to be recycled. But unfortunately in Australia under the Morrison government the majority of that material now goes into landfill. That is an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only 18 per cent of plastic in packaging is recycled. That's well short of the target of 70 per cent by 2025 by this government, and recycled content and plastic packaging is only around four per cent, with the 20 per cent target to be reached by 2025 again being missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for eight long years the coalition government has done virtually nothing when it comes to waste and recycling. It's a shame that it took a ban on imports from China and Indonesia and other key nations for Australia to finally do something under the Morrison government. Again, it's a recurring theme under this government—always reacting, never leading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community in our waste and resource management sector have been crying out for a national program of reforms that would not only reduce landfill and plastic pollution but increase the rate of recycling. In order to improve Australia's poor rate of recycling when it comes to environmentally harmful materials like plastic, it's vital that we dramatically improve our local processing and manufacturing capacity.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to supporting procurement policies there needs to be greater product producer responsibility when it comes to product design and the incorporation of recycled content. But this government, the Morrison government, has shown it's incapable of developing policies that actually encourage recycling and lead to the creation of new companies and opportunities for industries to grow. Where's the leadership on that in Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the export ban of mixed plastic that was in place from 1 July is in disarray. The industry itself has confirmed that Australia is not ready to reprocess additional plastics from the 1 July date. As a result, where does it end up? In landfill. There are more plastics going into landfill. And, despite the Morrison government being warned by its own commission report that stockpiling landfill of mixed plastic, as a result of its reforms, was not a low risk, the only response from the minister for the environment is to blame the sector, the states and territories and local government. Again, it's a familiar theme of this government—they don't take responsibility for anything—'I don't hold a hose, mate.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Information provided by a recent Senate inquiry into hazardous waste shows that the government was put on notice of the risk more than a decade ago, and we know that the Recycling Modernisation Fund has only spent around two per cent of its $190 million and so far only $4.5 million has been spent on the relevant waste processing projects. That follows a failure of the $100 million Australian Recycling Investment Fund that was announced in May 2019, which has not spent or advanced a single dollar. That says everything about this government's failure when it comes to recycling—the principal investment fund that they set up to encourage recycling in Australia hasn't spent a single dollar, because this government has failed. When the Australian people are asking themselves, 'What's the point of those yellow bins anymore?', they should be asking, 'What's the point of the Morrison government?'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Energy Agency is a conservative body that represents the coal, oil and gas industry, and they are giving us a warning. They are making it crystal clear: time is up. This statement hasn't come out of thin air, though. The world recognises that time is up. Time is up on new coal, new oil and new gas. It's time for pollution to start ratcheting down and for new renewables to go up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just the last month we've seen people killed in climate induced flash flooding across Europe and Asia. Across America and around the Mediterranean people are dying in climate fuelled fires. During a pandemic, we are seeing death and destruction from the climate crisis, the climate crisis which is being driven by coal, oil and gas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first warning, but it is dramatic. It is far-reaching. It will send a powerful message to banks and investors that the jig is up—that, no, we cannot keep burning this stuff forever. But, here, Liberal and Labor are talking about opening up new gas projects in the Northern Territory, using public money to do it. In the Northern Territory, the Beetaloo Basin and the associated Northern Territory basins contain 68 years worth of Australia's pollution. It must say in the ground, but Labor and Liberal are talking about taking money that could be going to schools and hospitals and using it to open it up and make the climate crisis worse. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why don't Liberal and Labor members get it? Banks get it; super funds and insurance agencies get it; state governments get it; firefighters, police and ambulance officers get it; kids get it. Why don't politicians get it? Is it the donations? Is it the millions of dollars that coal, oil and gas corporations shovel into the old parties' election funds that makes them wilfully blind, silent and complicit? Is it that simple? Is money all that it takes to pay off the government and the opposition to look the other way while a few coal and gas billionaires and big corporations wreck the only place that we've got to live in? Or is it the jobs, the jobs for the boys, the jobs for the former men of the Liberal and Labor parties, who, once they leave parliament, end up with the lobbyists or on the boards of the corporations poisoning our politicians with donations—the likes of Martin Ferguson, Ian Macfarlane, John Anderson and Mark Vaile? How well paid are these gigs that members are willing to sell every one of us out? Do they pay enough so that your conscience is clear? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or are politicians just scared—scared of losing power after being attacked in the pages of News Ltd? How is it that fear of climate deniers like Andrew Bolt and Tim Blair is worse than the fear of our kids losing their lives? Or is it fear of the big corporations? In this country the big corporations have way too much power. They're like the drug cartels. They've addicted our politicians. They extort public cash and outrageous approvals. They get so much special treatment to railroad farmers, local communities and traditional owners, and they often pay no tax and send their profits offshore, tax-free. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, members, we cannot deny the reality that we face. Members, you all know this. You might tell yourselves that it's not our problem, that there's nothing that you can do. But we all know the fires will be back. There will be more summers burnt by this government's and this opposition's failures. They know that politicians will be called out again and again on the world stage. Whenever this pandemic is over, the climate crisis will be there and it will keep getting worse. Young people have been forced to endure so much during this pandemic, and they have lost some of the best years of their lives to COVID and this government's failures. But now they are facing a climate crisis. And right now this government is going to court to argue that it doesn't have a duty of care to our children's future. It's clear that the coal, oil and gas corporations in this place have too much power, and you just need to look at the fact that they pay no tax as proof of that. </span>

For a few hundred votes, we can kick this government out, put the Greens in balance of power and make the next government go further and faster on the climate crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  Today the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish a distressing finding. Global temperatures are set to pass the critical 1.5 degrees threshold by the early 2030s, an entire decade earlier than expected. Two hundred and thirty experts reviewed 14,000 scientific papers in the last three years to give us this sobering statistic. As an academic, as a medical scientist, I know the work that goes into reports like these. This is empirical science and it's alarming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IPCC report will also find that human induced climate change was a major cause of the Black Summer bushfires that tore through my electorate, and many other electorates in this nation, 18 months ago. Just this week we've seen horrifying visions of wildfires engulfing towns across Greece, Turkey and Italy. California continues to burn, just like Canada did last month. It's hard for my communities to look at that footage. The emergency sirens are still ringing in our ears, and—it hurts me to say this—it's almost certain that those sirens will be ringing in our ears again. Temperatures in North East Victoria have already shot up one degree. They will go up another 2.4 degrees by 2050. That means double the number of extreme heat days and a 44 per cent increase in extreme fire danger days. The climate change crisis is well and truly here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations ranks Australia last out of nearly 200 countries when it comes to actions to reduce emissions. That's right: dead, motherless last. We've had our strongest diplomatic allies, like the UK and the US, begging Australia to step up and join them in their ambition. The EU carbon tariff is happening, whether the trade minister likes it or not, and the US will be next. And still the government bury their head in the tar sands. The International Energy Agency wants us to halt immediately any new coal, oil and gas projects. Instead, the government pump $50 million in taxpayer subsidies to frack the Beetaloo Basin, and they do that without any consent from the traditional owners. Our precious Great Barrier Reef is dying too. When UNESCO moved to label it as 'in danger' last month, the environment minister jumped on a jumbo jet to lobby oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to block the decision. I was shocked to see ministers of this government call that a win. As the head of the UNESCO marine program said, 'It doesn't matter what we're calling it on paper, the facts are the facts; the science is the science.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COP26 in Glasgow is only months away. Our Prime Minister must seize the moment in Glasgow to turn this nation's appalling record on climate around. This is a moment for courage, for leadership, but the only place we've seen real proposals for action on climate in this parliament is right here on the crossbench. There is hope if the moment is seized—proposals like the member for Warringah's net zero 2050 bill, which I was proud to second, or proposals like the local power plant, which I introduced, which charts an ambitious path for renewables in regional Australia. But, while the crossbench comes with solutions, this government presents excuses—and young people are wearing the costs of this reckless inaction, and my heart goes out to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people right now are spending some of the best years of their lives restricted by COVID. They're staring down the barrel of recession and endless debt, and now we're handing over a world to them which is quite literally burning. The mental health toll of this is immense. In the past, climate debates were fought on clear fault lines—scientists versus sceptics, industrialists versus ecologists, young versus old. Well, you'd be hard pressed to find these divisions in Indi; we have one of the highest median ages in Australia, yet our older folk are in lock step with our youth on climate. Farmers and businesses stand with our youth. Young people like Charlie Paterson, Lachie Sands, Cheyane Vaughan and Jessica Patterson—school captains and vice-captains from Benalla—marched in Benalla, side-by-side with people of all ages. Declan Thomas, from Yea, is leading an Indi youth advisory panel to advise me on issues like climate change. I will fight for young people like these any day of the week, any hour of the day. I promised to do it in my first speech; I promised to do it every day I am here. I am resolute, and I know other people in Indi stand beside me too. I will keep fighting for courage and hope and leadership.</span>

My community just cannot understand, and certainly does not tolerate, the fact that there are so many members of the House for whom the science is not settled, who don't believe the science. My community can't believe that there is not, by now, the strongest possible bipartisan response to climate change. We can't believe, down here in Tasmania, that the government has not pulled out all stops, that the government doesn't treat climate change as a genuine emergency and respond as though it's a genuine emergency. How on earth can the federal government not respond to the International Energy Agency and its very clear advice—that there must be no more carbon based energy production from this year, no more coal-fired power stations, no more oil, no more gas projects? And what about the latest IPCC report, which we're expecting out later tonight, advising that the average global temperatures will by 2030 increase by 1.5 degrees centigrade, which will be a full decade earlier than we expected as recently as only three years ago?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is we have an emergency. We have to start dealing with the emergency with a very clear understanding of what I think is the main takeout from this evening's IPCC report—that is, the atmosphere is now full. We don't have until 2050 to get our emissions down to net zero; the atmosphere is full. So rather than talking about 2050, as is the case by many people in the House—by the government and the opposition—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I'll happily take the opportunity. I assume someone's communicating with the member for Clark on the situation, but, nonetheless, I'll take my opportunity to make a contribution on this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the opportunity to talk about what the Commonwealth government is doing to undertake the three important elements of the energy transformation in this country, not only reducing emissions but also ensuring that we are reducing electricity prices and making sure that we have a reliable energy and electricity system. As a South Australian, I've got particular interest in the latter two points being done in concert with the challenge of emissions reduction, because it's very important that, in this country, as we reduce our emissions, we're also ensuring that the collateral outcome of that doesn't involve dramatic escalation of electricity prices for struggling families and businesses and, of course, the additional lack of reliability that is a risk if we're not ensuring that we have a transition that provides not only a reduction in carbon but also a stable, reliable electricity grid that is affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the news today from AGL in my home state of South Australia that they are building a new battery system on Torrens Island, a 250-megawatt-hour plant that goes with a lot of the other grid-scale battery schemes that are being invested in in my home state and across the nation, in many cases with support from the Commonwealth government through ARENA and other agencies. In South Australia, we now regularly have the situation where the entire grid consumption for our state is being provided from renewable energy. I'm proud of that and want to see that growing into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent decisions around an interconnector to New South Wales will put South Australia in an enhanced position to export more renewable energy out of South Australia to the national electricity market. We already have the 800-megawatt interconnector through the Heywood line to Victoria and now we're talking about building a 750-megawatt interconnector through New South Wales. That will put South Australia in the position to install a lot more renewable energy generation in South Australia and have the interstate export markets for our renewable energy there to firm up investment decisions, attract capital and see us investing in more renewable energy generation in South Australia, where there is a market and a home, which makes it a lot more viable. That will see a continued increase in renewable generation for South Australia, continued periods of time where renewables are the entirety of generated electricity while also ensuring that the affordability is there and the firmament of supply is there, because the challenges of intermittent electricity generation are still there with the renewables that we're installing. The more diverse generation we've got the better, and equally the ability to send that electricity interstate makes them a lot more economically viable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also very proud of the partnership between the CEFC and the South Australian state government to provide finance for home-scale battery installation in South Australia. We now have, on some metrics, the largest distributed grid on the planet, and this involves us being able to marry up installed PV solar on rooftops with a storage solution that genuinely means that a household in Adelaide can generate electricity when the sun's shining but be able to use it when the actual demand profile is there. One of the real challenges so far has been that you don't necessarily want to consume the energy at the same time that you're generating it, so storage at the local level is vital for that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we've got the largest distributed storage grid in the world and we proudly want to continue to expand that. It's these technology solutions that are going to see us address the important objective of reducing emissions. Of course, as a government we are very ambitious to get to net zero as soon as it is possible to do so. But the Prime Minister has made it clear that we won't mislead the Australian people by setting targets that we don't have a plan to achieve. That's what our government is about: practically investing in technologies that can see us meet those objectives while reducing emissions while also ensuring affordability and stability in the grid. I've outlined some of the things that we're doing. I'm proud to be a part of a government that is investing in those initiatives and many more to achieve these important objectives. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The resources sector plays a critical role in our national economy and never more so than at this time, when we are reliant on iron ore and coal being extracted and exported whilst many of our major economies are in lockdown, including in my own area of the Hunter. The workers of this sector are being left behind because of the Morrison government. My electorate of Paterson is proudly part of the Hunter region and workers across the Hunter are being exploited because their government has been weak and, staying true to their narrow-minded ideology, they are leaving workers behind. If you are doing the same job as the person alongside you, you should be getting the same rate of pay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a plan to ensure that workers in the mining sector receive the same pay for the same job. It is very simple: if you do the work, you deserve the pay and the entitlements that go with it. Last week, casual miners hopes were, sadly, dashed due to this government selling them out by teaming up with some greedy bosses to overturn their rights. The High Court decision was backed by the federal government and this has dashed the hopes of casual coalminers seeking justice and, more importantly, a pathway to permanency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the miners union for its work in fighting back against this terrible injustice. We know the WorkPac v Rossato appeal judgement winds back significant wins for casuals established in the WorkPac v Skene Federal Court decisions, including a commonsense definition of 'casual' based on the reality of work arrangements and a pathway to compensation for exploited casuals. In short, if you are working full-time hours doing the full-time job, you are a full-time employee and you deserve to be treated as such.</span>

I have a clear message for the workers and the miners in my electorate in this industry: don't get angry, just get even at the ballot box, because this government has sold you out and the legislation was passed by the Morrison government.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TIM WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  It is about the power of the unions to dictate and decide how people work, on what terms and in what circumstances, because they are the beneficiaries of the Australian Labor Party's largesse. They use the power they have in this chamber to benefit the few rather than to empower Australians to make their own choices and make their own decisions about how they wish to live their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you believe the members of the opposition, labour hire is an incredible sector which employs millions of Australians and seeks to undermine workers across the board. The reality is nothing like that. Labour hire is a discrete sector of employment arrangements which has been stable at around two per cent of workers over the last decades. Critically, labour hire provides a pathway for some people to secure employment on their terms and for their circumstances. I have labour hire companies that operate out of the wonderful electorate of Goldstein and work to provide pathways for people to secure employment and jobs—again, for their circumstances and on terms that suit them, not union bosses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that labour hire employees have exactly the same rights and protections as other employees when it comes to issues like unfair dismissal rights, award entitlements, general protections and, of course, workplace health and safety protections. What we make sure of, is that, when people secure employment on their own terms, based on their own circumstances, we empower people who may not otherwise be able to do so to secure employment. We provide a pathway where, for instance, women who may have particular circumstances to do with their family arrangements or their responsibilities to others can secure employment on their terms and in their circumstances, so they can stand on their own two feet. The same is true in any family arrangement. I know many people who, because of the casualised nature of other issues they face in their lives, may not want the rigidity of a nine-to-five job on terms that suit law but don't suit them. Ultimately, the focus of what this government is seeking to do is to make sure it provides pathways for every Australian who wants a job to be able to get a job—to have a go to get a go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants to stand right in the middle of any pathway that enables people to freely choose the terms and circumstances of their employment. This is the direct consequence, in part, of a significant decision made by the courts. We have introduced a new statutory definition of 'casual employment' that makes it clear that a casual employee is someone who has no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work. Doing this, and providing a pathway for universal casual conversion entitlement, means casual employees now have more opportunity to convert to permanent employment. This just requires employers—except for small businesses—to offer full-time or part-time employment to eligible casuals after 12 months of employment, unless there are reasonable grounds not to do so. What we have done is provided a pathway for people to be able to convert their working behaviour based on their interests. We've worked with small business and employees to be able to provide choices that seek what they want. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we know full well that that has been opposed every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party. Why? Because it empowers workers and it doesn't empower unions. In February 2021, Anthony Albanese and Labor voted against providing casuals with a more secure pathway to permanency and removing the $39 billion double-dipping liability on business. I was wrong, actually, in my comments before about the reason Labor voted against these initiatives being because they thought it would empower workers and not empower unions. It is because it would empower workers to be able to make choices and decisions about their own employment arrangements. But the reason they voted against it wasn't because it didn't empower unions; it's because it didn't empower union bosses, who are their mates, who are the people, just like superannuation funds and others, whose terms they want to dictate and empower—at the expense of average Australians.</span>

Those opposite: don't pretend you support mineworkers when at the same time you try to cut their pay. What we've got, in the member for Paterson, is someone who backs the industry and backs workers getting fair payment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we just heard from the member for Goldstein, where he referred to 'empowerment', is extraordinary. I'm yet to meet the worker who wants to be empowered to get a pay cut. I'm yet to meet the worker who says, 'If only I had the authority to be able to be paid less.' The workers who would be protected by what's being proposed by the member for Paterson, the workers who would be protected by 'same job, same pay', want to be empowered with a better take-home pay. I've met with these workers at Moranbah; I've met with these workers throughout Central Queensland. And it's not just the mining industry where this happens. People are employed by a company, and the workforce is usually represented by a union, because union workplaces do get better rates of pay. We don't resile from that for one minute. But, once an enterprise agreement is in place, some of these employers go off to a labour hire company. And, because those workers are technically employed by someone else, they come in and undercut the enterprise agreement rate. So you get two people working side by side on the exact same roster, where one receives a radically lower rate of pay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the answer? What's the policy solution that the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, just referred to? He said, 'You can deal with this through casual conversion.' What does his model mean? Well, if you're already employed by labour hire, the casual conversion legislation they put through doesn't let you change employer; you only get to convert within the labour hire firm. So he's offering the person who is already being paid less than the person they work side by side with to go from casual to permanent, still for the labour hire company, and be paid even less per hour still. The proposal that the member for Goldstein has just put forward as a way of dealing with the issue of two people working side by side, doing the exact same job, and one of them is being paid much less per hour than the other is: 'Let's just make the gap even wider.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have a good sense of what's reasonable and what's not, and it is reasonable that, if you're doing the same job on the same shift at the same workplace, then you get the same rate of pay. The member for Paterson will have had many conversations with mining workers throughout the Hunter, where they will tell you upfront their frustration at this not happening. Don't forget, in an industry like mining, when you've got these concerns, it's not simply a difference in pay; it's also a difference in security. What does that mean in the mining industry, an industry where safety concerns are not about whether or not you have a minor injury; safety concerns are about whether or not you are at risk of dying at work? People told me in Central Queensland—and mining workers everywhere will tell you, and the mining union will tell you, but those opposite might not know this—that people in less secure work are less likely to speak up about safety issues. How do the workers know this? Because they've got examples of labour hire people who did speak up about safety issues and they never saw them for another shift.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Job security is a safety issue. Job security is about us being a country where, if people have security of their job, they have security in their take-home pay and they have security in knowing that they'll be able to pay their rent, pay their mortgage, pay their bills. It's a security that this side of the House will defend for the workers of Australia and it's a security that those opposite are deliberately designing to remove from the Australian workforce. Everybody who sees the injustice of different rates of pay for the exact same job should know there's only one way to fix this, and it's a change of government at the next election and following what's been put forward by the member for Paterson.</span>

For some people, labour hire isn't part of their immediate world. But its effects on working conditions and wages are far-reaching, whether we think about it or not, which is why I'm very pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Paterson.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian workers and Australian consumers are affected by the increase in labour hire. It is a nonsense to say that people choose labour hire because it empowers them in some way to negotiate a better deal. They do it because they have no choice. They cannot go directly to the organisation and get the job that they want. It is being channelled through labour hire. I'm going to talk about that in the private sector as well as the public sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't tell, when you're looking at the person who is caring for your loved one in aged care, whether they're employed by a labour hire company or not. You can't tell, when you speak to someone on the phone at Services Australia, whether they're employed by a labour hire company or not. You can't tell when you're looking at a mining site or a building site. But there are two really serious consequences that occur for people employed by a labour hire company. One is that these workers are on lower wages, without access to entitlements that give security and dignity to people's lives—things like annual leave, sick leave and parental leave. A consequence is that they may not be in a position to ensure that the environment that they work in is as safe as it should be. They don't have the voice they would have as a permanent worker. They're without all sorts of security. That means that, financially, they can't get a bank loan, they can't buy home or even build up a reserve to start their own business. In the COVID environment we've seen that, along with all those things, people in insecure work are the first to lose their work, the least likely to have a buffer and the most likely to miss out on financial support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think of the longer-term effect on wages that this scenario has created. The value of wages that people get has continued to fall under Liberal prime ministers. While wages grew an average of 3.6 per cent under Labor, it's been less than half that under this government. Long before COVID hit, wages were flatlining. Ross Garnaut describes the pre-COVID economic environment created by the Liberals as 'the dog days—a time of listless growth and historically low wages'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason so many people were feeling pressure on their family budget pre-COVID was that we came from a time when workers were seeing their fortnightly pay rise by, on average, $100 a week every year or two. That's what we used to have—a steady increase. But these days it takes an average worker seven years to increase their pay by $100 a fortnight—stagnant, dormant, listless, sluggish; I feel a bit like Monty Python, saying those things! We have had flatlining wages. It begs the question: how many essentials were families going without pre-COVID because of the failure on wages? Right now, many are in much more dire straits. It's pretty simple: when it comes to labour hire rorts, the government are ripping off casual workers. Workers doing the same job at the same site should get the same pay. That should be the standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's another consequence, and that's in the public sector—about not just the pay but the quality of service my constituents receive when they interact with a department heavily reliant on labour hire; Veterans' Affairs is a case in point. It was confirmed earlier this year that the level of labour hire staffing in DVA is 42 per cent. Forty-two per cent of staff are employed not by the department but through a labour hire firm. This is a department with an increase in claim and client numbers far in excess of what had been predicted when the Liberals first put these artificial caps on the numbers of staff within departments. In 2012 DVA thought it would have less than a quarter of a million clients in 2020; in reality it has more than 320,000 clients. Its case load is extraordinary. The CPSU says its members report that some colleagues are managing more than 250 cases. This is one of the consequences, and it has to stop. We have to tackle these issues, and Labor will. Secure work has financial, economic and mental health benefits across our society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  [by video link] I'm pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Paterson. Last week we saw the High Court overturn the Federal Court's decision in the case of WorkPac v Rossato, in yet another blow for casual workers who are fighting for job security. Casuals are already facing an uphill battle because of the Morrison government's push to legitimise the concept of permanent casuals—casual workers who stand side by side with full-time employees, working the same hours day in, day out, only to take home substantially less pay. This government has turned its back on the Australian value of 'same job, same pay'. It has legitimised wage theft and allowed job insecurity to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the facts. Pay rates for labour hire casuals are on average about 30 per cent less than those of permanent workers, and that's if they don't take leave; the difference is closer to 40 per cent if they do take leave. The widespread use of casual labour hire in construction, manufacturing and mining is a blatant cost-cutting measure that leaves regional communities hundreds of millions of dollars a year worse off. Australia has the highest proportion of temporary labour in the developed world. About 40 per cent of Australian workers have casual or insecure jobs, like gig work or labour hire. In the medical and health sectors close to 23 per cent of the workforce is casual; in building and construction it's 23.6 per cent; and in the accommodation sector it's 44 per cent. For these workers, financial insecurity is the norm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to deregulation of the labour market over the last 30 years, too many Australians are now stuck in limbo as permanent casuals. It is commonly accepted that casuals are paid a loading to compensate them for insecure work and lack of paid leave. But most casuals are still receiving less than permanent workers doing the same job. In fact, for many casuals, the longer they remain trapped in insecure work, the more likely they are to be paid less than their permanent co-workers. Half of all casuals would prefer to have a permanent job with paid leave, but in some industries workers aren't given a choice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's casuals who have also borne the brunt of this pandemic. In March last year, when the first wave hit, many casuals lost work and many were excluded from JobKeeper. It's now 18 months later, half of the country is in lockdown, and casuals have once again been plunged into uncertainty. Some have lost hours, while others are still working on the front line as essential workers in retail, aged care, disability support, transport and cleaning—people on low wages who can't work from home or access sick leave if anything goes wrong. On the other side of this crisis, we must make sure that Australians who want secure jobs can find them, especially in regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish, I'd like to turn to the impacts of casual work on mental health and wellbeing. The link between insecure work, financial distress and mental health crisis is well known. As soon as the sector you work in is at risk, your mental health is at risk; and, as the demands of your work grow and the control you have over your circumstances drops, the risk increases. Over the last 18 months, hundreds of thousands of Australians have found themselves out of work as businesses have folded or workforces have been trimmed, and many people are experiencing mental health problems for the first time in their lives. We know that almost one in five Australians will struggle with their mental health in any year. But some Australians are much more likely to experience mental health problems, including those looking for work or those in insecure work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mental ill-health has been described by some as a second-wave or shadow pandemic, and this government is risking people's lives if it doesn't create more opportunities for secure work. In the National Suicide Prevention Adviser's <span style="font-style:italic;">Interim Advice</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Report</span>, it was recommended that the government should 'develop a Commonwealth process for reviewing new policies or initiatives to ensure they assess any impacts—positively or negatively—on suicide risk or behaviour'. The Prime Minister says mental health is a priority, and I believe him, but he can't ignore the impacts of his policies on mental health and wellbeing, especially when it comes to the casualisation of the workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the Productivity Commission's final report in its mental health inquiry that mental ill-health is costing the Australian economy upwards of $200 billion a year, a sum that is reported as being a conservative estimate. We know that these aren't just numbers in a ledger. These are real people, and their lives are at risk as they struggle to find work and struggle for more secure work. The Prime Minister says mental health is a priority, but every day, in the policies and the decisions of his government, he's risking people's mental health and their wellbeing. Our communities deserve better. Local people deserve better. Casual workers across Australia deserve better.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  I'm here on behalf of casual and labour hire workers on the north side because insecure work and low wages have created a perfect storm for them, and this Morrison government does not care. When South-East Queensland went into lockdown last week to stop the spread of the delta variant in our community, north-side workers in insecure work—people who were casuals, contract workers, gig economy workers and labour hire workers—suddenly saw their hours slashed or taken away altogether overnight. These workers instantly fell through a trapdoor into a financial abyss, with no annual leave, no sick pay, no holiday pay, no family leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current industrial relations landscape we find ourselves in is not one that is here by chance or by happenstance of the free market, as those on the other side of the House would lead workers to believe. No, workers are worse off today because of deliberate policy decisions made by consecutive Liberal-National governments who value profits over people; who think we live in a corporation, not a community; and who care more about the national budget than the household budget of a family living in Boondall. Under the Liberal-National government, the nature of Australia's workforce has been shifting for a decade. Over one-third of the workforce is currently in insecure or non-standard forms of work, directly impacting many workers' ability to provide for their families and to plan for the future. Wages are projected to decrease over the next few years, while the cost of living continues to climb. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How did we get here? Well, here are just a few examples of the Morrison government's cold and systemic war on workers. In 2019 the former Minister for Finance declared that wages were low by design, as part of the Morrison government's deliberate economic strategy. In February 2020 the Morrison government created an amnesty for dodgy employers who had not paid their workers adequate super entitlements. Earlier this year, in the midst of a global pandemic, the Morrison government wrote to the Fair Work Commission cautioning against an increase in the minimum wage. And who could forget the Morrison government's crowning glory built with thorns for Australian workers, Work Choices 2.0? It was designed to strip workers of their legal rights and, when it looked like the bill wasn't going to pass, the Morrison government vindictively took out the wage theft provisions, the only provisions which Labor had agreed to support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At every step of the way, the Morrison government has sent dog whistles to dodgy employers that it's okay to rip their workers off, and I have seen the consequences of that every day in my community. There is no more egregious example of the Morrison government giving the green light to a dodgy boss than the Prime Minister and his mate Alan Joyce. The Morrison government has handed out $2 billion in corporate welfare to Qantas without any conditions that that money be given directly to the workers, the workers who paid the taxes that were the money in the first place. With $2 billion worth of taxpayer funds in their pockets, Qantas has slashed their workforce, denied workers who have been stood down from taking sick leave, frozen their wages for two years and tried to outsource 2,000 jobs to a labour hire company because workers have stronger bargaining abilities as a unionised workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Federal Court's decision that Qantas acted illegally when trying to outsource those 2,000 jobs, we have heard nothing from the Prime Minister—not in the media, not in the parliament, not a word about it. The Prime Minister has Alan Joyce's number on speed dial. He needs to pick up the phone and tell Alan Joyce to reinstate the 2,000 workers who were stood down when it was announced that their jobs would be outsourced to a labour hire company. He also needs to tell Alan Joyce that any taxpayer support that is given to Qantas must be used to keep workers in their jobs, jobs on the north side of Brisbane. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As your federal member I will always fight to protect the jobs of northsiders and protect them from wage theft and the exploitation of honest workers. Only Labor have a plan to tackle exploitative, insecure work. A federal Labor government will defend your penalty rates and your rights at work. We will legislate to properly define casual work. We will explicitly insert job security into the Fair Work Act. We will crack down on cowboy labour firms to guarantee same job, same pay. We will put a cap on back-to-back short-term contracts for the same job and enforce portable entitlements for workers in insecure industries. When the election comes, Australian workers will remember who fought for their rights in a pandemic and which Prime Minister did them over at every single opportunity.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I continue to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and related legislation. I would particularly point out that overseas students are our fourth biggest export. Not too long ago, before gas crept up, it was our third biggest. When you look at iron ore, coal and gas they're not value added in the way that educating overseas students is. So rather than the Morrison government helping protect an industry that was worth $40 billion just five minutes ago, the Morrison government has taken delight in attacking higher education providers at a time, during a pandemic, when they most need a helping hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher education providers have been snubbed, insulted and abandoned during this pandemic. Prime Minister Morrison very deliberately changed the JobKeeper rules three times to make sure universities could not get the support they needed. If that's not systemic bias motivated by short-term cultural wars or misguided political war games then I don't know what is. How short-sighted is that, to attack our fourth-largest export and neglect a $40 billion industry?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At least 17,300 university workers lost their jobs in 2020 because the Morrison government denied them JobKeeper: academics, tutors, cleaners, gardeners and cafeteria staff, many with families to support. It is expected that at least 7,000 researchers will lose their jobs over the course of this pandemic and, as I heard from university vice-chancellors over the last few weeks, we're in danger of losing our greatest research minds for good. Once they're gone, they may never return. In the middle of a crisis, the government cut support to universities that was meant to keep Australia's world-class research alive.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                    </a>  I'll take that interjection from the member for Cowan. We know that academics need a bit of certainty. The government provided $1 billion in the 2020 budget, and I commend them for that, partly to cover the impact of falling international student revenue. Then, this year, basically with no return of international students in sight because of the bungled vaccine rollout, they have cut that funding and the pipeline is dry. It means that the students who would flow on for two, three or four years aren't coming—there's nothing coming down the pipeline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to understand why the government has attacked universities as viciously as it has. We know that; we've seen a drop from 20 per cent down to 12 per cent. International education was the fourth-largest export industry before the COVID pandemic. It supported about 250,000 jobs across the Australian economy—and remember that's in the bush as well. We know that universities are major employers in regional areas; they support over 14,000 jobs—not that you'll ever hear recognition of this fact from the mouth of a National Party MP. In the city, universities keep communities afloat: it's good economics. But that's especially so in the bush. Every one dollar invested in higher education research and development is linked to a five-dollar return to GDP. Every one dollar invested in university teaching and scholarship from government contributes three dollars of additional taxation revenue. It makes economic sense to support universities during this pandemic crisis. But instead of supporting our fourth-largest export, the Prime Minister goes from one exercise in marketing spin to the next without actually achieving anything or doing what he's paid for—for doing his job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are more than 35,000 Australians still stuck overseas and more than 200,000 international students who can't get back to Australia for study. Some are holding on, but that is tenuous. The Prime Minister had two jobs: the vaccine rollout and effective quarantine, and he has failed in both. If he had done his job, set up national quarantine facilities and managed the vaccine rollout, those 35,000 Australians would have returned home by now and international students would be coming back to study rather than being poached by Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. They're poaching our students and poaching our fourth-largest export. Sadly, neither of those things have been achieved in terms of vaccine rollout and effective quarantine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's astounding that not only have the Morrison government failed to set up national quarantine facilities but they've failed to manage the vaccine rollout and failed to support universities through this crisis. And they made things even worse for universities with their Job-Ready Graduates Package. This scheme, introduced into parliament last year in the midst of the pandemic, was designed to cut Commonwealth funding to cover the cost of many university courses and, at the same time, to increase student fees overall. Universities—which, remember, have already lost more than $3 billion—will receive less money to teach some courses, like science, engineering and teaching. Those are not unimportant courses; some may say they are the very courses which form the backbone of a skilled workforce, of a smart Australia. Real funding for higher education will fall by 10 per cent over the next three years. Some students who commenced study this year face fee hikes of double the previous fees. Those students are going to be left with a mountain of student debt when they enter the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the actions and inactions of the Morrison government have consequences and one of those consequences is that it will make it harder for Australia to recover from the COVID-19 recession. I mentioned before that I've been speaking to many of the vice-chancellors of universities right across Australia in the past couple of weeks. What struck me as I listened to their despair was that there is still no pathway for international students to return to Australia. It struck me how badly this has been handled by the Morrison government. Several of the VCs mentioned the Prime Minister, early last year, telling students to go home. Remember that? Remember the Prime Minister saying, 'Go home'? It was a comment that perfectly bookends with Prime Minister Morrison's 'Where the bloody hell are you?' campaign when he headed Tourism Australia, before Fran Bailey, the then Minister for Small Business and Tourism, sacked him. Those two comments were horrible comments as a message to the rest of the world. I say that, particularly, as a Queenslander and being from a state that thrives on tourism. Some vice-chancellors were concerned that the Prime Minister's comment would be remembered by those students. They took it home. They took it to their hearts: students who were here at the time and whose view of Australia will be permanently soured when they could have been our best ambassadors, better than DFAT in a way because they're not funded. They actually go out to the rest of the world and sell Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to be a leader during a crisis. It tests people. Cometh the hour, cometh the man or woman. It's a shame that we don't have a leader in this nation who is up to the task. It's not what our nation needs at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that the Morrison government has damaged Australia's world-class higher education system, placing thousands of university workers' jobs at risk and jeopardising Australian research. International student numbers are not going to magically return to full capacity when the vaccine rollout is eventually completed. I say that in the hope that it will be eventually completed. As I said, these pipelines are heading elsewhere, to Canada, to the United Kingdom, to the United States. It's going to take time to undo the Morrison government's mismanagement during this pandemic. Recovering from the COVID-19 recession is going to take world-class leadership. We're going to need a skilled workforce, and we will only obtain that by having world-class higher education systems.</span>

We know that, before COVID-19 hit, the Gold Coast international education sector contributed $1.6 billion to the local economy and $40 billion to the national economy. It has taken a hard hit. It was the first sector to be damaged, and unfortunately it will be the last one to recover.</span>

JobKeeper, of course, was a huge help to education providers in Moncrieff, across the Gold Coast and, indeed, across the country. Australians should know that it's the Morrison government that has assisted Queenslanders, including international education providers, with $30 billion of financial support already delivered.</span>

Those who were in lockdown can apply from yesterday through Services Australia, and I encourage those who've lost work hours to do so. We on this side continue to stand behind Australians as we always have. In April this year the Morrison government provided more than $53 million of targeted support for international education providers most affected by COVID-19 border closures. The measures have benefited thousands of domestic and international students and Australian businesses who support local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline for Australians what these measures are and then some real life examples from my electorate. There are an extra 5,000 short-course places for domestic students, and around 100 eligible non-university higher education providers—or NUHEPs, as they're known—in 2021-22 are being supported with $21.6 million in funding. Short courses are to be offered in any discipline. This will support NUHEPs affected by the decline in international enrolments to pivot their businesses to domestic delivery. Priority has been given to those on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, known as CRICOS. Around 30,000 existing and prospective students will benefit from lower fees through the extension of FEE-HELP loan fee exemption until the end of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An innovation fund was announced as part of the $53.6 million package of measures to support international education providers in the 2021-22 federal budget. There is $9.7 million to establish the innovation grant fund to allow eligible private higher education and English language intensive courses for overseas students or ELICOS providers registered on CRICOS to apply for up to $150,000. Applicants were required to demonstrate the effect of border closures on business turnover, outline their efforts to adapt to the current operating environment and demonstrate how they would benefit from the grant funding. I can now report back to the House that three schools in my electorate of Moncrieff—Inforum Education Australia, Shafston International College and BROWNS English Language School—in just the last week have been awarded grants of $149,500 from this fund, which will help provide them the opportunity to adjust their business models, to grow their market base and to improve online delivery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke to Richard Brown last week, he was still full of passion for his sector. We agree that this grant will by no means replace the students that they've lost or the revenue and the staff, but it will assist him to engage with stakeholders he needs to reinvent his business model. Richard told me that he very much appreciated this assistance, as it's been difficult to carry the blows of the last 18 months during the pandemic. His plea, in which I join, is for all Australians to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that the international education sector can once again thrive and prosper on the Gold Coast and indeed across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important measure taken to help the sector is regulatory fee relief and this is what these four bills are particularly about. Some $17.7 million will see domestic fees and charges collected by CRICOS, TEQSA and ASQA waived until 31 December 2021. These measures have taken effect from 1 July this year. Regulatory fee relief will apply across the tertiary and international education sector and no action is required from providers; fees will automatically be waived. This will support the ongoing operations of more than 3,500 providers registered with ASQA as they deliver quality training to around four million students who access Australia's VET system each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revised cost recovery arrangements for registrations on the CRICOS will commence from 1 January 2022. These bills give effect to the government's decision to implement an updated cost recovery model for the CRICOS, announced in 2021-22 budget, to better align the charging framework with the Australian government charging framework from 1 January 2022. The government had delayed the introduction of an updated cost recovery model for the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, along with TEQSA and ASQA, due to external factors including the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Act 1997 gives authority to the department to collect annual registration and entry-to-market charges on behalf of all ESOS agencies. The ESOS act sets out the ESOS agencies for different providers. Broadly, they are: ASQA and ESOS agencies for registered VET providers;TEQSA for registered higher education providers and the secretary of the department for school providers. The updated cost recovery model will involve the department, ASQA and TEQSA recovering their own costs related to CRICOS activities. The department will charge for its regulatory responsibility as the ESOS agency for school providers, and charge all CRICOS registered providers for its cross-sectoral CRICOS regulatory effort. This just means that education providers are going to be paying less in fees in the long run. The department has sought stakeholder feedback on the updated cost recovery model. A cost recovery implementation statement will be released later this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, while international education providers may question the timing of the new arrangements, they represent an overall reduction in the department's collection of CRICOS charges from the sector and will help to maintain the quality and reputation of Australia's international education sector, positioning it for recovery and hopefully regrowth into the future. It is a long road back, but the government are doing everything they can to assist this particular sector. The registration charges bill will provide the legislative authority for the department to stop collecting the EMC and ARC on behalf of all ESOS agencies. It will also enable the department to recover the costs of administering and regulating CRICOS providers' activities through a CRICOS annual registration charge for its cross-sectoral provider registration and international student management system and CRICOS activities, and administering the ESOS framework, along with a school initial registration charge and school renewal registration charge. It sounds quite complex, but we all know that this bundle of bills will help Australian education providers, and that's why those on the other side are agreeing to these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amount of charges will be prescribed by regulations setting out the amount or method for calculating the amount to be made by the Governor-General through the executive council. The cost recovery bill will amend the ESOS Act to require registered providers to be in good standing with all ESOS agencies in regard to their CRICOS regulatory fees and charges. It will also clarify the monitoring powers of ESOS agencies by making it explicit that they are able to undertake the function of a compliance audit on CRICOS registered providers they are the ESOS agency for. The bill will also amend the ESOS Act to make the CRICOS annual registration charge payable within a 30-day period beginning on the day after a written notice is given to the provider from the secretary of the department, instead of the last business day in February of the year. In practice, the annual charges will be required to be paid at a similar time through this amendment, though this amendment will allow future flexibility in the timing of annual charges if necessary for unforeseen circumstances. The amendments will require registered providers to pay the fees and charges relevant to them as and when they fall due, including any penalties for late payment. Failure by a provider to pay the relevant fees and charges will constitute a breach of its conditions of registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, also one of the bills in this bundle, will amend the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012 to add a definition of 'total enrolments' to the TPS levies act. This definition was previously contained in the registration charges act but is being repealed from that act as a consequence of this package of amendments. The definition will also clarify that an enrolment will be included in the calculation for the TPS levy when a student has an enrolment in a course and has also undertaken study in that relevant period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 will amend the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Act 2021 to remove references to the old charging framework. Thank goodness I'm almost at the end; I won't have to say TEQSA again! That's a summary of what these bills are for. They will help the international higher education sector. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                    <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  [by video link] I'd like to congratulate the member for Moncrieff for getting through all of those acronyms! I want to thank the member for Moreton for introducing the second reading amendment to this bill. I rise to speak in favour of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Moreton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course Labor supports these bills, which aim to streamline cost recovery arrangements for the regulation of education providers who provide services to international students. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 repeals and replaces current charging provisions with a new framework, although most of the details, of course, will be set by regulation, which as you would know, Acting Deputy Speaker Vasta, is generally not the ideal way to arrange these matters. But the pattern from this government of trying to avoid transparency and accountability for its decisions continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, we will be supporting the bills. They make minor and consequential amendments arising from the original bill. The three related bills make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, and we will support them all. Labor, in principle, agrees with cost recovery in this area, although we did oppose the introduction of cost recovery in the TEQSA legislation that is in the Senate at the moment because it's a very bad time to be adding additional costs to higher education providers. Higher education providers have had an extraordinarily difficult couple of years, with Australia's international borders closed and a very important source of revenue for their operations consequently being unavailable to them. So while we support cost recovery in principle we don't believe now is a great time to be doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the legislation being debated today, while we opposed the broad shift to expanded cost recovery in the TEQSA legislation, this particular set of bills is expected to reduce charges on international education providers and prevent providers from being double charged for the same regulatory activity. So we'll be supporting today's legislation. We support any reduction in charges at the moment, but this reduction in charges will only partially offset the hiked fees relating to the TEQSA bill that Labor has opposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've moved a second reading amendment today because of the continued concerns we have about the way this government has undermined the university sector, particularly in the last couple of years. The government has systemically been trashing Australia's higher education system—the message has been sent to students and staff and to the parents who are hopeful that their kids will one day get a university education. If you look at the last 12 to 18 months, we've had a university system that is absolutely desperate and crying out for help from a government that not only continues to turn its back and turn a deaf ear but acts in a hostile way with universities. Thousands of university staff are losing their jobs around Australia. Thousands of students have seen their fees more than double. More students than ever are wanting to go to university and too many are being turned away. No other industry of this size has received overt hostility like we have seen from the government towards the university sector, with the government changing the rules of JobKeeper three times to make sure universities were excluded from receiving JobKeeper. Casinos got JobKeeper but our great public universities did not get JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While all of this was happening, the government introduced legislation that more than doubled the cost of a degree for thousands of students. Think about the year 12 kids who were doing their final exams last year. They had their heart set on a particular degree. In the middle of last year, we had the lockdowns, the disrupted learning, the uncertainty. Rites of passage were interrupted—the school formals that didn't happen, the 18th-birthday parties the kids didn't get to go to. Those kids, thousands of them, were told that the cost of the degree they had their heart set on would more than double. And look at year 12 this year. In New South Wales we've been in lockdown for weeks. Year 12 students have been told they will be doing their final exams, and now they are being told they probably won't be doing their final exams. In Victoria and Queensland there's a great deal of uncertainty as well. These kids have had two years from hell. This year's year 12s were in year 11 last year and experiencing all of those disruptions. They were hoping that they would get to do their final exams this year and experience all the rites of passage that teenagers look forward to. Why doesn't this government make it cheaper and easier for these kids to get an education? Whether it's at TAFE or university, now is the time to make it cheaper and easier for these kids to get an education after school. We know that they won't be having the same gap-year jobs that many of their friends would have had in previous years. They certainly won't be doing any gap-year travel. Let these kids go to uni or TAFE and let them do it in a way that's affordable and accessible to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The university system has been crying out for assistance from this government and, on top of the confusion, the uncertainty and cost recovery in this instance, they are also looking at decreased real funding for the university sector. Real funding for higher education will fall by about 10 per cent over the next three years. The budget papers confirm that, because of job-ready graduates, funding for the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, which subsidises student fees, will fall and student debt levels will increase. We know that fees have been going up; as I said, more than doubling in some cases. A Bachelor of Arts will see fees increase by more than 113 per cent. For a four-year degree, students are looking to pay close to $60,000. These are American sized university debts, and our kids shouldn't be lumbered with them at the same time as they're trying to save a deposit in an increasingly unaffordable housing market. At the same time as they're thinking of starting a family, these kids are lumbered with these $60,000 debts. Law and commerce students will have their fees increased by nearly 28 per cent. This isn't just bad for individual students—although, of course, it is terrible for individual students—and it's not just bad for the university sector, which reports losing about 18,000 jobs, although, if you look at the ABS statistics, it looks like more like 30,000 jobs were lost from higher education. This is also bad for our national prosperity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at countries that are doing well economically in the modern world, they are countries that invest in research and development and higher education. We know that a skilled workforce is the key to our economic prosperity in the future. Before COVID, we had real problems in our economy. Wages were going nowhere, business investment had stalled, growth was low, labour productivity was going backwards for the first time in 25 years and, according to research by Harvard University, we had one of the least complex economies in the world. Why is that a problem? We as a nation have always done so well from our commodity exports, and they will continue to be a huge and important part of our economic prosperity in the future. But we know that, if we are relying on raw commodities for our national wealth, we're very subject to changes in international markets. There are the different demands for our goods; of course, sometimes that might be because economies are changing internationally. Sometimes it is because other countries decide to introduce trade barriers when it comes to our commodity exports. Either way, the more complex and value added in our economy, the more irons we have in the fire and the more likely we as a nation are to continue our prosperity. Our university sector is key to this, both because of the research and development done by our universities—a large part of that obviously subsidised by international student fees—and because we know that an educated workforce, a workforce where you've got people going to high-quality vocational education or high-quality university education after they've finished their secondary school, is much more likely to underpin continued prosperity for Australia in the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of international students will have cost the Australian economy $18 billion. That's a loss to universities, and it's a loss to the landlords, the restaurant owners, the cafe owners and the businesses that support those international students who are spending money in our local economy. It's a loss to the businesses that rely on the work that international students do in the Australian labour market. But it's also a loss to us as a nation, because we know that the return on investment that governments get from investment in higher education is a return of 200 to 300 per cent, according to the OECD. As we cut funding to universities, as we allow this sector to flounder, we have endangered our prosperity in the future—the prosperity of individual Australians and the prosperity of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude with a few words about jobs in tertiary education. Tertiary education is our largest services export and our fourth largest export overall. If any other export industry was shedding jobs at the rate that the university sector is shedding jobs, there would be a national rescue package from this government. It is a mark of their hostility towards higher education that there has been no assistance for universities. Universities have identified 18,000 jobs that have been lost, but that doesn't cover the contracts that have expired, the research that hasn't been renewed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that job losses so far are closer to 30,000 from the university sector. This is serious. Of course it's professors and academics, but it's also cafeteria workers, librarians, admin assistants, gardeners and construction workers, because added investment in universities has ground to an absolute halt. This is serious. These people have families. They've lost their jobs, they have families and they have a government that just doesn't care. The government doesn't care about the jobs that are being lost in universities today, and the government doesn't care that they are making it harder and more expensive for year 12 kids this year and the kids who graduated last year to get an education. If we look at the United States, they're actually trying to make a college education more affordable for their young people in this really difficult time. We're doing the exact opposite in Australia. We're taking a university sector that is democratic, that has tried to give more people a go at getting their dream job, that has invited people who are the first in their family ever to go to university—we've invited them into our universities; we've gone out and tried to get them to have a shot at university—and this government is shutting that down. Shame! What a shameful thing to do in a year like this.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of this package of bills, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and related bills. I want to make a couple of points to start with. I do note that universities, like many sectors of the Australian economy, have been hit hard by COVID. In February 2021, the Universities Australia issued a press release saying that revenue across the sector had decreased by 4.9 per cent from 2019-20. Of course this varies across universities ], with some hit harder than others, and I particularly note in that respect that at least three universities in the country reported operating revenue increases, which is quite surprising. I also acknowledge that there have been significant job losses across the sector, and all of this is regrettable. However, I also note the loss of 4.9 per cent in operating revenue is significantly less than a lot of sectors, such as in tourism and in hospitality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to these bills, they relate to international students and they don't just relate to universities. According to the department's monthly update of international student enrolments, in May 2021 there were 525,892 international students studying in higher education, VET, schools, ELICOS and non-award sectors in Australia. Higher ed made up 54 per cent of those; VET, 37 per cent; schools, two per cent; ELICOS, five per cent; and non-award, two per cent. The majority of students come from China, at 29 per cent, followed by India on 18 per cent, Nepal on eight per cent, Vietnam on four per cent and Malaysia on three per cent. Given the impact of COVID, it's not surprising that these numbers are 17 per cent down on the same time last year. The most significantly hit sector is the ELICOS sector, which is down 64 per cent on its enrolments in 2020. Non-award is down 65 per cent, schools are down 31 per cent, universities are down 12 per cent and the VET sector is only down by 0.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decrease in enrolments of international students in 2021 and 2020 has caused significant discussion and some alarmist predictions about the future of Australian international education. There is no doubt that education providers are feeling the bite of this at the moment, and there will be pipeline impacts over at least the next three years. However, an examination of the historical data on international enrolments in Australia shows that while the overall enrolments have been steadily increasing over the past three decades, there have been periods in which it has been hit by a variety of factors. There have been dips and troughs. I note particularly the period between 2011 and 2014, where there was a 10 per cent decrease between 2010 and 2011 and a further nine per cent decrease between 2011 and 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth noting that the mix of our international education sectors has not been static over that time period. By way of comparison with the current statistics, I note that in the year 2000 there were 188,277 international students enrolled with Australian education providers—almost one-third of the numbers today. At that time, higher education had roughly the same proportion—57 per cent. VET was significantly lower, on 16 per cent, schools had six per cent and ELICOS had 19 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mix of countries from which international students came was also significantly different from what it is today. The two largest cohorts came from Singapore and Hong Kong, both at 11 per cent. Malaysia was at 10 per cent and Indonesia at nine per cent. And it's worth noting that India, which is currently sitting at 18 per cent, was only 5.6 per cent of student enrolments in the year 2000. I make these points to illustrate that, while it's taking a hit at the moment because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our education sector will rebound. It has rebounded before. It may look different, but changes have occurred before. And there are very good reasons as to why some changes need to and will take place now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal minister has recently announced a process to develop a 10-year strategy for international education in Australia—and it is timely. I would say that the starting point for this should be: what are our universities for? I note, with regret—and I know that others who have worked in the university sector also feel regret about this—comments that are made, when talking about international education, only focus on the economics of it. I don't want to downplay the economics of international students. It is vitally important to our country; it is vitally important to our universities. But that is not the sole, the only or even the most important reason as to why we engage in international education. It's also not the reason why we have universities. So, with respect to the federal minister, I would say, in developing that international strategy, let's go back to basics. Let's use that to shape our international strategy for the way forward. Should we be looking at a better diversification of countries from which we draw our international student population? That has a lot of social and cultural benefits for our country, and for their countries when those students go back. And if you talk about economics, it also means we're less dependent on one particular marketplace or one particular country for our international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also look at increasing the diversification of courses that students enrol in—don't have all of our international students enrolling in specific courses, such as management or commerce, where they all currently tend to enrol. Let's diversify that. Let's have a national plan for diversifying where our students come from and the types of courses that they enrol in. By all means spread it across the country. Our regional universities and our city universities all could benefit from a really well-thought-out international strategy. Within that, we should also look at the diversification of the levels of study that they undertake, right from ELICOS up to higher degrees. As we develop that strategy, I'm still forever confident that our international student enrolments will rebound. The reason why I say this is that Australia's education system is excellent and it has an international reputation for excellence. The most recent survey of international students in Australia, which was the 2020 International Student Experience Survey, shows that 91 per cent of international students expressed that they had a positive experience living in Australia. This was in 2020, during COVID, and 91 per cent were still saying they had a positive experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the reason—not the only reason at all—why we have such reputational excellence is the regulatory framework that underpins the sector. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act, the ESOS Act, establishes requirements and standards for the quality assurance of institutions offering education and training courses to international students in Australia on a student visa. The ESOS Act also provides tuition fee protection for international students. Australian education providers, both public and private, must be approved for registration on the CRICOS, the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, before they can promote or deliver courses to overseas students. CRICOS lists all Australian education providers approved to teach overseas students and the courses that they offer. CRICOS-registered providers must have met and continue to meet the requirements for the ESOS Act and the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students. Any providers wishing to deliver English-language intensive courses for overseas students or foundation program courses must also meet the ELICOS or foundation program standards as relevant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, the Australian government recovers the cost of administering the ESOS Act and regulating education providers. The registration, regulatory compliance and enforcement functions under the ESOS Act are actually shared across three ESOS agencies—the department, as the ESOS agency for schools; ASQA, as the ESOS agency for the vocational education and training sector and standalone ELICOS; and TEQSA, as the ESOS agency for the higher education sector and foundation programs. These bills give effect to the government's decision, as part of the 2021-22 budget, to implement an updated cost-recovery model for registration under CRICOS. Pursuant to these bills, the responsibility for implementing cost-recovery arrangements will move to the individual ESOS agencies. In effect, this means that ASQA and TEQSA will recover the cost of their activities, and the department will charge for its regulatory responsibility as the ESOS agency for all school providers and charge all CRICOS-registered providers for its cross-sectoral regulatory effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of finishing, I acknowledge, as I said at the outset, that Australian international education providers across the board—we're not just talking universities here; in fact the sector which has been most hit is our ELICOS providers—have been impacted by COVID. It is also very likely that our sector will change over the coming years. But I look at this with optimism. Such change is not unprecedented and nor is it something which should be feared. Provided our educational sector, from schools through to higher education, continues to offer excellent educational offerings, it will continue to be an extremely vital and critically important sector within Australia and contribute to the success of our nation in social, cultural, diplomatic and, yes, economic ways. An efficient, effective and sustainable regulatory environment and regulatory bodies is a key component of this. I'm therefore very happy to support the bills.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  [by video link] I am pleased to join with my colleagues, particularly with the member for Sydney, in speaking on this bill. And I thank the member for Moreton, who moved the amendment in support of Australia's university workers, students and institutions. Labor supports these bills, which aim to streamline cost recovery arrangements for education providers who provide services to international students. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 repeals and replaces current charging provisions with a new framework. We're disappointed to see that much of this framework will be set through regulation, but that just continues this government's track record of avoiding any sense of transparency and accountability. The three related bills make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, and so we support the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we've opposed parts of the broader shift to expanded cost recovery for higher education providers, this legislation is expected to reduce charges on international education providers and to prevent providers from being double charged for the same regulatory activities. It's worth noting, though, that this reduction in charges will only partly offset the hiked-up fees that providers are facing because of government actions this week in the Senate. It's funny how many times I find myself saying these kinds of things when it comes to this government. Sure, they're giving a little on this side but they're taking again on the other. They're saying one thing but they mean another. They're telling the Australian people one thing but they're doing something else entirely. And that's absolutely the case when it comes to higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher education has a proud history in this country. The licence plates on my car have a little by-line on the bottom, 'Victoria—the Education State'. We're proud of our education system in Australia, and that's due to the efforts of Labor governments over the past century investing so significantly and to the passion of academics over so many years. We've grown over decades to be the higher ed powerhouse of the world. For a long time in my electorate, right here in Cooper, we've been proud to have so many international students call our community home—students who are studying at La Trobe University, RMIT, Melbourne uni, you name it. They've come here to study at our world-class universities. It's something we're proud of, both right here in my community and as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our universities are massive employers. La Trobe University is the largest employer in my electorate. Thousands of my constituents are contributing to the education of our next generation. They're proud to work in universities. They're teaching our kids and they're helping them plan their futures. They're making sure that learning resources are accessible. Workers at the university are keeping these kids fed on campus and keeping the surrounds clean. They're contributing to the functioning of these enormous institutions that are so vital to our social, cultural and economic wellbeing as a community. They're proud of their jobs and we're proud of them. It's with them in mind that I speak here today in support of assistance for our universities, for the workers in them and for the students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is undeniable that the government has abandoned them. This Morrison government has abandoned our universities, the workers and the students. This is a trend that started before the pandemic, but it has now snowballed into something else entirely. There is no mincing words on this. Our universities are in a dire position, and the blame can only flow in one direction: the Morrison government. They have refused to support our universities every step of the way. The universities have been crying out for assistance for a year and a half now, to no avail. When the pandemic started, the flow of international students stopped entirely, as we know, and universities moved to online delivery models. They were posed with so many challenges but, my goodness, they worked hard to overcome them!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you carry out medical research when you're at home? How can you train a nurse or a vet—even an engineer or a teacher—from home without the practical experience they need? They were faced with challenges beyond the pale. University staff, whether they were tutors, lecturers or support and admin staff, stepped up to the task and they made it happen. But, as COVID drew on, the situation became dire. The numbers were crunched—by university qualified accountants, might I add!—and support was surely needed in the absence of such a significant portion of their students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I distinctly remember the relief that was felt when JobKeeper was announced. We immediately reached out to the universities, who employ so many of our constituents, asking if they were eligible—and for all intents and purposes they were. The relief was something I can't put into words; you could hear it over the phone as we spoke to them, and I certainly felt it myself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the following week came an announcement from the Treasurer: universities were no longer deemed eligible for JobKeeper. The thousands of employees at the universities in and around my electorate were not going to be supported by the government through the toughest time most of us had seen. Don't be fooled; this wasn't an oversight. The government deliberately changed the rules to exclude university workers as if their work weren't as important as that of the rest of the workforce that was experiencing the tough times. In fact, they changed the JobKeeper rules three separate times to make sure the workers weren't supported. It was a complete and utter disgrace. As a result, universities have announced over 18,000 job losses and redundancies since the pandemic began.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in my electorate of Cooper, hundreds of university workers have lost their jobs. But this figure tells only part of the story. Many casual workers have lost their hours and their jobs, and many staff haven't had their short-term contracts renewed. Recent data from the ABS shows there are 30,000 fewer Australians working in higher ed than there were at the start of last year. This is a sector that is now being systematically hollowed out by a government that just doesn't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact on the workers is one part of the equation, but the massive impact on the students is another. As a result of these job cuts, university students are seeing their once sought after university degrees reduced to something that barely resembles a prior qualification. Teaching hours are massively reduced. The quality of resources cannot be anywhere near the standards teaching staff want and need them to be. Options for study have declined dramatically. At La Trobe University, the all-important history department is at really severe risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, the actual cost of degrees is skyrocketing. This year's budget papers confirm that, because of the government's so-called job-ready graduates scheme, funding will fall and student debt levels will rise. I know that this semester tens of thousands of Australian students have started university facing fee hikes, with many having had their fees doubled. Those studying a Bachelor of Arts have had their fees increased by more than 113 per cent. For a four-year degree, students will be paying around $60,000. Law and commerce students have had their fees increased by nearly 28 per cent. You're paying inflated fees for a degree that, in most cases, may not be near the quality of the degree you signed up for in the first place. Boy, oh, boy! Young people have a lot to thank this government for!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, across the board, young people in my electorate are furious with this government. This is a government that has allowed the scourge of insecure work to take hold, affecting the vast majority of young people. Now, because of insecure work, they're excluded by the government from wage subsidies. For many of them, this means they're now out of a job. Many will turn to education and training as a pathway to getting a new job, but this government, as well as attacking universities, has underresourced and underfunded TAFE. So where will our young people turn? Will they turn to the jobs program this government can't seem to get right, or to emerging industries? I know that, here in Cooper, the government certainly isn't investing in those. They're not acting on climate change. They're not acting on housing affordability. They're abandoning young people in this country. They just don't care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So young people and academics, in their wisdom, are trying to appeal to the Morrison government's own interests. We know that this government doesn't care about young people, workers or education, but you'd think that, at the very least, it could see the economic benefits of a successful university sector. International education was a $40 billion export industry. It's estimated that, by the end of the year, that number will be down to $22 billion. In my electorate we see the flow-on economic effects that universities bring, with all of those students shopping and renting here, and the incomes of all of the workers being spent in the local economy. It's huge, and it's vital to the survival of so many businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House know that, while this is a crucial part of the picture, the value of universities isn't purely economic. Because our universities are hollowed out, we and our society lose vital knowledge. We lose the experts, the researchers and the historians, and, with them, our students and our young people lose the opportunity to learn from them and to take this knowledge and apply it to the jobs of the future. This loss is monumental. It's hard to put figures into words. I know La Trobe University's history department is under threat. This is how catastrophic a loss this is—losing historians and the teaching of our history, because this uncaring, irresponsible Morrison government can't find it within itself to support the university sector. It's just a disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the workers and students at La Trobe and at universities across the country: we are on your side. We are standing with you. We will fight tooth and nail against the government's cuts to the university sector, and we will continue to fight for proper support for you. University workers deserve to be recognised as the vital workers they are. Students deserve the quality education that Australia has become so renowned for, and Australians deserve an education system that is up to scratch and a government that is up to the task of delivering it. The Morrison government doesn't even come close.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  The government says we need this legislation, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and associated bills, to fix issues with fees for higher education, when we all know that the actual problem in higher education right now is cuts. When it comes to the fees question, we've seen that this government's only solution to higher education is to increase fees for thousands of students across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about the young people in university, seeing their entire university world changing over the course of their degree—course cuts, fee increases. Who is left to explain this government policy to them? We know the Prime Minister refuses to meet with chancellors. We know the Prime Minister refuses to meet even with a delegation led by a former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. So, instead, these changes are left to academics to explain. Academics are fabulous at transferring knowledge from one generation to the next. I'm joined by two fabulous academics: Dr Anne Aly, who had a fabulous career in academia at Edith Cowan University before joining us in this place; and Dr Andrew Leigh, a former professor of economics at the Australian National University. But, wherever you are working as an academic, it shouldn't be your job to explain why the government is making higher education more expensive and less accessible for people. But that's what this government has left the academics who work today to do. They are explaining to their students why they're paying more than they have, why they're getting less face-to-face teaching than they've ever received. Indeed, some of these academics, these sessional tutors, weren't able to get JobKeeper and have lost hours and time in research. This government has treated academics with absolute disdain over the last 18 months. Clearly they are the people it thought about least when it thought about who it could support through this pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the opportunity to attend university is both a privilege and a right for generations of Australians. When I went to university it didn't matter how much money my parents had, and it didn't matter if I had saved up tens of thousands of dollars; all that mattered was that I had the academic requirements and the passion to go and study. It really upsets me that a generation of young Australians won't feel the same and will have to make an economic choice. The government, when it pushed through changes last year under the cover of a global pandemic, said it wanted to put more market forces and more economic choice into the decisions students make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Australians know that 'if you have a go, you get a go' is a hollow slogan when it comes to higher education. It's fair to say that young Australians today probably think they have been dealt a very harsh hand. For a year and a half they have faced challenge after challenge. Right now they need support from the federal government like never before, but instead this government has hit them with a knowledge tax; that's the only thing it has done to support students over the course of the pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government thought it was appropriate last year to increase the costs of some degrees by 113 per cent. If students choose to do a humanities degree they will face as much as $14,500 in fees in their first year, and it will go up every single year after that. By the completion of their degree, they could be facing a debt of some $60,000. A debt of $60,000 will take those students some 15 to 20 years to repay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see a lot of debate about what should happen with superannuation and what should happen with housing policy. But the government never acknowledges that the gift it is giving hundreds of thousands of young Australians is a $60,000 debt that they will walk into the workforce with on day one. For some students that's bumping up to US-style debts of some $100,000 or more. And, while students are paying even more than they ever have for their education, the government's saying, 'The students are now paying for it, so we're going to pull money out.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen in this year's budget the government locked in a real funding cut of some 10 per cent for higher education. While students are having these 40 per cent increases in their fees, the government's pulling out 10 per cent of their funding. This is a government that defends its trillion dollars of debt as 'careful fiscal management'—that's a quote of those opposite—but doesn't seem to be able to find any money to invest in the next generation. Young people and students across Australia must be thinking: 'Who is going to stand on our side? Who is on our side when it comes to higher education?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the history of what Labor has done when we have been in office, there is no doubt that we have invested in education and invested in opportunity for young Australians. We saw university funding increase from some $8 billion in 2007 to some $14 billion in 2013. When you compare that to the $3 billion cut out of the TAFE sector under this government, you know that there is a difference in the way that people see our role in this place in providing opportunity for our future workforce. They're the numbers, but, if you think about the actual lives changed, an extra 220,000 students got an opportunity to go to university because of those changes by the Labor government. Under then education minister and then Prime Minister Julia Gillard we saw an increase in opportunity for young Australians. That's what we should be focusing on when we're doing our work in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the sorts of students that started to go to university, we saw financially disadvantaged student enrolments increase by 66 per cent and we saw Indigenous undergraduate enrolments increase by 105 per cent—a doubling of the Indigenous undergraduate cohort over the course of that six years. That changes people's lives. Even more encouraging, students with a disability increased by 123 per cent over that period of time. That's how you give people opportunity. That's how you expand access to higher education for all—not with the sort of legislation that we've seen put before us today and in recent years from this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about what we've learnt out of this pandemic and what we've learnt out of our need for a highly skilled and trained workforce: we might be forced, with closed international borders, to rely on the capacity of our own people. This government saw all that happening and decided it would instead whack nursing students with an eight per cent fee increase, whack agriculture students with a 10 per cent fee increase and whack clinical psychology students with a 15 per cent fee increase. Engineering students are seeing their fees increase by 16 per cent, maths students are seeing their fees increase by 17 per cent, law students are seeing their fees increase by 28 per cent, and medical students are seeing their fees increase by 32 per cent. That's this government's response to the need to skill our own people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where that's actually happening is in the courses that are lucky enough to continue, because the other thing that we've seen is this huge cut in the number of courses, as universities struggle with cuts in their funding and cuts in international student numbers and are not receiving a single cent of JobKeeper. Some 17,000 university staff have lost their jobs over the last year and a half—that's 13 per cent of the university workforce gone, kicked out. Some 14,000 jobs in regional Australia are supported by our university sector, and they are under threat as well. I note that to the members of the National Party who are in the House right now. Last month we saw some 200 workers lose their jobs at La Trobe University. In Western Australia, we are seeing universities having to make incredibly difficult decisions because of the choices of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Western Australia is planning to gut its social science courses: research positions gone; entire disciplines removed; sociology, anthropology and others gone; and those are just the start of the cuts. Some $40 million will be cut from the UWA budget because the university is not getting enough support to continue to run the programs it has run in the past. It's Western Australia's oldest university, and some of these disciplines have been taught for nearly a century. We know that up to 300 jobs will be cut from UWA. Indeed, the vice-chancellor acknowledged that these cuts will impact everybody at the university. It's not the only university that's been forced to cut staff. Murdoch University has opened voluntary redundancies across the campus to facilitate a $25 million cut in funding. Yet we hear nothing from the Prime Minister about this. I want to thank the students currently at UWA who are campaigning against these cuts and campaigning to save their courses. They're campaigning not for themselves, because they will probably be able to continue their courses until they graduate, but because they know that these disciplines are so important. I want to say to these students, 'Thank you for the work you're doing and for standing up against these mean cuts.' I particularly thank Katherine Ong, with whom I've been fortunate to speak. She's leading some of these student campaigns. I thank Linc Murray, to whom I spoke on Friday. They just can't understand why these courses are being cut. I also thank Nicole McEwen and some of the other student activists who have been making sure that students really know what's happening in their courses. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sarah Ison, a reporter from the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> newspaper, spoke to Dr Tauel Harper, a lecturer in media and communications at UWA. The article said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Media and communications lecturer Tauel Harper said his research informed his teaching and the proposal to move him to "teaching only" was devastating. "My research is my life's work," he said. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He's done work that's been relied on by the WA parliament, the Victorian police and the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet about how we counter violent extremism and how we prevent it from having a home here in Australia. These are the sorts of things that will no longer be researched because of these cuts. The government had a choice last year. They chose three times not to give JobKeeper to our universities—not once, not twice, but three times they actively came in here and said, 'No, universities will make do with what they've got,' despite the fact that they were so hard hit by international students being unable to return to study. It's estimated that universities have lost $3 billion from border closures alone. When JobKeeper passed through the parliament, the Treasurer described it as, 'One of the most important days in the parliament's history.' For universities it was one of the most devastating, a clear sign that this government did not see supporting universities as part of its job. The government proudly declared that JobKeeper was worth $130 billion as part of a $251 billion package of unprecedented economic support. But not a cent of JobKeeper went to Australian universities. The Treasurer said of the global pandemic that Australia stood 'on the edge of the economic abyss'. But this government left those universities standing there alone. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that higher education is important. It's been important to my life. My parents were fortunate enough to attend Claremont Teachers College as a result of former Prime Minister Whitlam opening up higher education to people with backgrounds that were less fortunate than those who'd studied there in previous decades. I was fortunate to attend Curtin University, a university I have incredibly fond memories of. It gave me a world-class education, and I want to say thank you to every one of my lecturers and the academics at Curtin University. When you can attend university in person, you have the joy of making friends, and some of them become lifelong friends. At Curtin University I met Zaneta Mascarenhas. Curtin University is located in the federal electorate of Swan. Curtin University is WA's largest university, and since we met some 20 years ago Zaneta and I have stayed in touch. My son Leo and her son Lincoln now have play dates and they are very good friends. Every day that I have known Zaneta Mascarenhas she has been passionate about access education, ensuring that every Australian can fulfil their potential whatever their background, whatever the income of their parents. She is exactly the sort of person we need in this chamber. I'm very excited that she has chosen to put herself forward for federal parliament as a candidate for the seat of Swan. She was born in Kalgoorlie and grew up in regional WA. She is currently the manager at a local WA energy consultancy. She has had a long career working as an engineer—none of this cosplay stuff that we see from those opposite. She has actually worked as an engineer in mining and engineering, making sure we keep the Australian economy going, and she serves on the South Metropolitan TAFE council—a true commitment to tertiary education, both TAFE and university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think putting an engineer in the parliament is the right sort of thing to do right now. It's getting those skills that you get from a fabulous university, like Curtin University, and applying that very rational thinking to the policy challenges we face. It's having someone who is grounded in the practical application of realities and of science—someone who understands that science is fact as opposed to an optional extra in your policy formulation. And Swan desperately needs someone who will stand up for them, for the working families in Vic Park, for the pensioners in South Perth and for the students in Bentley. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it's great to see you in the chair! I want to thank the member for Sydney, the member for Moreton and the member for Perth. I agree wholeheartedly with everything that has been said to date. I want to talk about a couple of issues to do with overseas students and international education generally, as well as speak in particular about this bill, Education Services For Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, and the related bills. As we've heard from previous speakers, Labor does not oppose these cognate bills. The legislation is of course far from perfect; however, on this side of the House we're supporting it. As we have done through the pandemic and in general, the opposition is not in the business of opposing legislation for the sake of relentless opposition—as we've seen in past oppositions. But even when we extend support for legislation from the government it does not mean we abandon our scrutiny or refrain from criticising the government, where that's warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's always an interesting experience to rise and speak on legislation brought forward by the government that impacts universities and higher education. This government has a troubled track record when it comes to unis, and the sting from this track record is made much worse when we consider the size and contribution of this sector to our economy. I can inform the House that in my electorate of Solomon—that's Greater Darwin, Darwin and Palmerston in particular—Charles Darwin University has made an immense contribution to our life in the north: to our cultural life; obviously to our academic life; and to our economy. Nationally, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, international education was the fourth-largest export industry in Australia. Students came to Darwin from all over the globe, looking for a world-class education, and to universities around the country. They were looking for those qualifications which would guarantee some employment and for the experience of studying and living in our remarkable nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These students enriched the quality of campus life at universities across Australia and of course they worked in a variety of roles in our economy, in small to large businesses. The revenue generated from this total holistic process was significant. International education contributed $37.5 billion in export earnings to the economy per annum, universities employed about 130,000 full-time-equivalent workers in academic and professional roles, and the sector supported over 250,000 jobs throughout our economy. So it was significant indeed and very much deserving of more attention and support that the sector has received from those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the pandemic hit Australia, the sector was badly impacted by both the closure of borders and the inability of students to travel here. The sector needed support to cushion this impact and to make the bounce back to normal easier and quicker. What did this government do to support this large and important industry? Not only did they not do anything, their actions betrayed a cavalier disregard for the continuing viability of universities and higher education in this country. Anyone would think that they were blind to their own life story and to the role of universities to their current circumstances. The fact that they're sitting in the seats that they are is in no small part because of the university degrees that they received. But then, as is often the case with those opposite, once they achieve that position of power or influence, it must have been their own brilliance alone that got them to where they were, not the contribution of so many people in academic institutions that assisted their learning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget that this government changed the rules and requirements for JobKeeper three separate times to deliberately exclude universities. The fourth biggest sector in Australia, as I mentioned earlier, was treated like that when, we're well aware, there were big companies whose revenue and profits were going up and who received JobKeeper support but not our universities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That once booming export sector will lose $3.8 billion in revenue across 2021. At least 17,300 workers employed by universities lost their jobs last year, and the job losses have continued this year. Those losses are in critical areas of research and expertise, which, apparently, we hear from those opposite, are important to them, and research and expertise apparently is pretty important in the future of work, the pandemic that we face, and our want to leap ahead when it comes to high-value, high-tech items to export and to manufacture. We need those critical areas of research and expertise, and these losses which have taken place across disciplines and faculties constitute a serious hit to the intellectual capacity of our nation. So it is hitting intellectual capacity, hitting the economy and hitting the R&amp;D that we hear those opposite understand are important to our future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This lack of support has led to 7,000 research positions effectively disappearing. The people who occupied those positions will either go overseas or, unfortunately, leave research altogether. The tragedy of this is that, once removed, that capacity is very difficult to replace. This loss of research and teaching capacity can even be found in the discipline of Asian studies. Who would have thought that Asian studies would be important in the Asian century? Universities across Australia have cut back on Asian studies, including the teaching of Asian languages. That is just dumb. It is dumb, but universities have to make hard decisions when they're faced with such a lack of support from a dumb government that doesn't seem to connect the dots between our future in this region and the need for our universities to be training people of all ages, not only in Asian languages but in Asian studies in general.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a think what that defunding means for languages here in Australia. We are living through some of the biggest changes ever experienced in our region. It is an era of complexity, and we hear that often. The challenges that we face in Indo-Pacific are significant. What we need is obviously the ability to defend ourselves from any threats and we need to be able to protect Australia and her interests. What we also need is for really smart people who will become the diplomats of the future to be able to speak languages, to be able to understand intimately our region so that they can effectively apply that trade craft in order to secure Australia and our interests. We want to equip the next generation with the language and knowledge needed for that understanding. It's absolutely critical. So the government needs a plan to deal with this looming knowledge crisis, and I call upon those opposite to act immediately to properly fund our universities, including those Asian studies programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International education in Australia may have taken a mighty battering from the pandemic and the indifference of those opposite, but the industry survives, and we must look to the future to restore and resuscitate this important sector to our economy and to our future. I don't know if this legislation will achieve this; I doubt it. The backbone of this sector was always international students themselves, and we need to bring them back. And I should stress that I am not calling for international students to be brought back at the expense of Australians stranded overseas. That's another major failure of this government. Had they acted quickly last year, all stranded Australians could have been evacuated home by now. Had those opposite built a national network of effective quarantine facilities, as they were advised to do in advice that they themselves sought, these evacuated Australians would have had somewhere to safety quarantine upon returning home. But I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The future viability of higher education in this country rests on being able to bring international students back to Australia, and we can do this, but we need somewhere for these students to quarantine when they arrive here. But that's not hotels—to the geniuses opposite—because hotel quarantine leaks. We've counted about 28 leaks so far; maybe there have been more. But hotel quarantine leaks. We need dedicated quarantine facilities, because those hotel quarantine leaks are costing our economy billions—that's with a 'b', billions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One such place suitable for a dedicated national quarantine centre is the Top End. Those opposite would know that Howard Springs has been providing a wonderful service to our nation in getting stranded Australians home. The Olympians are there at the moment, and Australians who need to travel to the Northern Territory will continue to quarantine there. We've also got another facility, called Bladin Point. It can take 1,500 people per fortnight. I've written to the Home Affairs minister about the centre. I understand that she has visited it recently. I hope she very much enjoyed her visit to the Top End and I hope she saw how effective Bladin Village could be in quarantining international students so we can get those international students back into our universities—because we are being done like a dinner internationally. Other countries' governments that are being smarter than our current Australian government are making sure that international students know they're loved, know they're welcome back, and have got avenues through which they can quarantine and resume that relationship with their universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year in October, when the Prime Minister received advice on standing up more dedicated quarantine facilities, if we had stood up Bladin Village, as one example—but there are others, as we know, in Queensland and in Victoria, or near any capital city—we could have got tens of thousands of stranded Australians home and we could have started to get many more international students home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, we've got half the Australian population in lockdown, some due to leaks from hotel quarantine. So I stress again, for those opposite, that bringing international students back into Australia has got to be done safely. That means dedicated quarantine facilities. We've got that facility up in Darwin, and I encourage them to use it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID pandemic has in many ways changed the world and the way we live. Some of these changes will be with us forever, but others will be transitory. I'm glad the government has put this package of legislation to the House. However, it does not go far enough towards rebuilding the international education sector, so I call on the government to put politics aside and act to save our universities and our international education sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No great nation treats its tertiary education sector this way. Compared to our competitors, we are losing big time. Other nations are making headway, and we are totally squandering our competitive advantages in attracting overseas students. I encourage those opposite, the current Australian government, to do better. Listen to the advice you were given a long time ago, pull your finger out and secure pathways to Australia for international students. As I mentioned, in Darwin we have a dedicated quarantine facility that has been largely unused. Get the international students in and give them the jabs that they need, if they haven't already got them. They will have a great education in the Northern Territory, where we are COVID free—touch wood! We have a great record when it comes to dealing with COVID. Let's get the international students home.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  I join with other members of the House in expressing my delight at seeing you in the chair, Deputy Speaker Dick. I reiterate some of the points that have been made about Labor's support for the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and cognate bills, which aim to streamline cost-recovery arrangements for the regulation of education providers who provide services to international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the member for Sydney for bringing forward the bill, the member for Moreton for the amendment that he has moved and speakers on both sides who have contributed thus far to the debate on this bill. I found the contribution by the member for Curtin to be particularly refreshing. It is refreshing to see an individual who has the level of experience in the higher education sector that she brings to this parliament contributing to this kind of debate and bringing that experience here. It is refreshing, particularly, to hear her acknowledgement of the value of Australia's education system—not just its economic value but its value in terms of its diplomatic efforts and cultural connections with other countries—and that this doesn't affect just our university students but a range of providers to international students. As somebody who worked in ELICOS, taught ELICOS and worked as an administrator at a university, as a teacher at a university and as a researcher and professor at universities, I'm proud to stand up and speak in defence of all of those providers within the higher education sector who provide education services to international students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned, Labor supports these bills, because Labor will always support bills that make it easier and cheaper for students to access education and for providers to deliver quality education to Australian students. These bills, though they make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, do contribute in some way to a broader shift to full cost-recovery for the regulation of higher education providers. Labor has, however, proceeded with caution, particularly around the fact that most of the details to be set in these bills will be set through regulation, which is something that members on this side have spoken against because that does not lend itself to the kind of transparency that Australians expect and the accountability that Australians should be getting from their government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst we're not opposed to cost recovery in principle if it's well thought out, and we will not oppose these bills, we will be raising those issues, the ways in which these bills fall short and the regulation of the provisions set in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll have more to say about universities, particularly the devastating impact on universities not just through COVID but through this government's actions, both active and passive, where it has either actively attacked the university sector or—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to pay tribute to a true believer, Ardashes Tchamkertenian, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 90. Ardashes was a great rank-and-file volunteer for the cause of Labor. Born in Cairo of Armenian descent, he migrated to Australia in 1979 with his beloved wife, Marie, and young son, Hagop. He was fluent in Armenian, Arabic, French and English and ran a hardware store in Cairo, but he wanted the better life for his family that Australia offered. He worked hard, and he was a tireless volunteer in his later years. After Marie died in 2004, he'd spend every morning in my office, having a cup of tea, reading the paper and opening mail.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ardashes was passionate. He would take anyone not accepting a Labor how-to-vote card at prepoll as a personal insult, and he disliked Liberals and the Greens equally. He wore a cap every single day and would often be seen around Marrickville in a campaign shirt, not just during elections.</span>

Through pure determination, strength, talent and courage and through rigorous training, they made it to the Olympics. Because of this, they're all winners in my book.

Volunteers don't do what they do for accolades or acknowledgement. My annual Burt Volunteer Awards acknowledge their contribution and also encourage others to get involved. The winners of the volunteer awards are just the tip of the iceberg in our community.</span>

Rob started the first inclusive sporting team in our community. This year the inaugural integrated all abilities AFL footy team has provided many local people living with disability the opportunity not only to play footy but also to get involved in the club in non-playing roles.</span>

But it's literally on the border and I take a very keen interest in its progress because so many of my constituents will have the opportunity of being associated with the many and varied exciting economic and cultural activities that are happening there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we had the exciting development around the Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre, a $200 million new facility to be built on North Terrace which is funded as part of our city deal. The finalised concept drawings were completed and released publicly. Now, of course, the final stages of development approval are being undertaken with the hope that we'll see a sod turned on that element of the project early next year. This is a milestone achievement for what is the jewel in the crown of that development. The whole precinct has nearly a billion dollars worth of investment, which will create thousands of jobs in emerging industries into the future. One of the really important cultural anchor elements of it is the Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre. I'm really pleased to see this progressing on time. It's going to be an exciting cultural institution for not just the people of Sturt and the city of Adelaide but the whole nation to celebrate Indigenous art and cultures. I'm proud to be part of a government that's delivering this project.</span>

People want the government to fix this bungled vaccine rollout; higher pay for our dedicated aged-care workers; justice and dignity for refugees both onshore and offshore; purpose-built quarantine facilities; action to improve and expand our mental health system; a federal independent commission against corruption; urgent action on climate change; income support; increases for pensioners and older Australians; support for renters who have lost their income due to the pandemic; much more support for the arts and the travel sectors, both severely impacted by COVID restrictions; better superannuation for carers working during lockdown; the LGBTQ+ community represented in the census; a royal commission into the management of hospitals; action on the gender pay gap; constitutional recognition for First Nations people; humanitarian support for Myanmar; an investigation into Indigenous deaths in custody; more funding for public housing; support for interpreters, staff and families who assisted the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan; and Australians overseas, families, friends and loved ones to be finally brought home.</span>

Lives Lived Well provides support for people in Queensland communities who are impacted by alcohol or drugs and are experiencing problems with their mental health. Their aim is to take a holistic, compassionate and harm minimisation approach to help people live their lives well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only a few years ago, in 2017, when I first joined the Lives Lived Well team to open their first office in Beenleigh. Over the past five years, they've provided individual alcohol and other drug counselling and support services to over 1,200 people in my community. They have identified a need in the community for this service and have specifically designed their programs to meet the diverse needs of our community, including working with young people, children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities. Lives Lived Well have a firm belief that with the right support people can truly change their lives for the better. It is this belief that we all should be inspired to take when working with our community. I commend the work of Lives Lived Well and the revolutionary approach they are taking in this space. I look forward to working alongside and supporting Lives Lived Well well into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  We're in the middle of a national emergency with half the country locked down because of the Prime Minister's failure to take responsibility and do the two jobs he set for himself at the start of the year. But, last week, throughout the parliament, we had the Prime Minister and members of the government telling us what a great job they're doing and how terrifically well everything's going.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is we still have no safe national quarantine system 18 months into the pandemic and we're still coming near last in the developed world on the vaccine rollout. But, instead of fixing it, we have these demented, deranged, deluded, dishonest and downright dangerous comments from government members. The cost of their failure is growing every day: the deaths and disease we hear, day after day now in New South Wales; the record number of calls to Lifeline last week, our national suicide prevention hotline; and the businesses being destroyed. The Reserve Bank of Australia now says there's $2 billion of economic damage done every week and counting. That's tens of billions of dollars of unnecessary debt being loaded for the next generation to repay, and the risk of a second recession is growing. And there is vaccine hesitancy. The vaccines are our ticket out. We have to get it done quickly. When the vaccines finally arrive, it is a race, so I urge the government to take up Labor's positive proposal: $300 to every adult vaccinated by 1 December. It's cheaper than lockdowns and their waste and rorts, it'll overcome hesitancy and it's economic stimulus when we need it to avoid a second recession.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I rise today to speak about the Bayside Mental Health Roundtable I recently convened in my electorate of Bonner. I believe there is a great need for increased mental health services, particularly on the bayside of Bonner and especially during this unprecedented pandemic. To understand the thoughts of the Bayside, I encouraged the community to take part in my mental health survey. Over 500 responses were collected in just two weeks. It was a truly overwhelming response. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents believe that there is a real need for more services in our community. With a clear need for more support, I want to ensure the Morrison government's $2.3 billion investment into mental health sector services delivers on the Bayside.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a next step I organised the Bayside Mental Health Roundtable. I involved mental health experts from the Bayside who have a deep understanding of the needs of our community to workshop solutions with me. I was joined by a range of community providers, including but not limited to service providers, GPs, first responders, schools and more. Learning about life-changing work our mental health experts are already doing in our community was a privilege, along with how all levels of government can work together to better support them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue pursuing the outcomes of the Bayside Mental Health Roundtable and fighting for the funding for my community. I extend my sincere thanks to all those who took part in the roundtable. These conversations are just the beginning.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  [by video link] When the pandemic hit, many Australians obviously had thousands of dollars tied up in travel plans that had to be suddenly cancelled, replaced instead by lengthy periods of confusion and frustration as refunds were chased down. Over a year on I continue to be approached by constituents who are struggling to get their money back for cancelled flights and bookings or who have grudgingly been given flight refunds or travel credits with improbable time lines for use, all of which goes to show clearly that current Australian consumer law just isn't cutting it. That needs to be remedied, which is why I’m supporting CHOICE magazine's call for a suite of reforms to provide greater clarity, consistency and fairness for travellers who can't get the travel services they paid for due to circumstances outside their control. Indeed, CHOICE's recommendations would ensure that consumers are informed and protected, including measures to lift standards of service, easier processes for customer refunds, fairer travel credits and vouchers, and clearer procedures for disputes to be heard and resolved.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the pandemic has been tough on many people, including, I should add, on many travel agents who've worked tirelessly to help their clients. Reform is clearly needed. I call on both the government and the opposition to get behind CHOICE's recommendations.</span>

They also make fidget blankets to support those with dementia to use when they receive their treatment. At the beginning of the pandemic, the QCWA in Mermaid Beach made hundreds of litres of soup and donated to HAVAFEED Community Relief in the Mermaid Beach Community Centre. They support those less fortunate, who are doing it tough. </span>

Yet this time last year, in August, the United States had six supply agreements in place; the UK, five; Japan, three; and Argentina, one. This time last year, Australia had none, because this time last year the Prime Minister and his government were too busy doing a victory lap. Yet, when it came to the step which would actually see Australia defeat COVID-19—Australians receiving both jabs—that is a step that the Prime Minister said was not a race. Because of that, on this day, 15 million Australians are in lockdown. On this day, only 18 per cent of Australians have had both jabs. So, on this day, Australia languishes at almost the bottom of the OECD table. On this day, businesses across the country are losing tens of thousands of dollars every week because of lockdowns, and those in Sydney have no sense of when the end is in sight for their lockdown. On this day, it's completely clear that the Prime Minister and his government have absolutely no proper plan for dealing with COVID-19. If they don't have a plan for that, when the day comes that we are actually on the other side of COVID-19, what confidence can we possibly have that the Prime Minister will have a plan for our country's future?</span>

Over the weekend, I wrote to Premier Andrews urging that he review his decision to lock down regional Victoria, due to a lack of evidence of any cases, and, instead, implement a ring of steel around Melbourne. Premier Andrews has publicly suggested that the New South Wales Premier put a ring of steel around Sydney. All I ask is that he follow his own advice and restrict movement between Melbourne and the regions. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of this pandemic, I have argued that a targeted, measured and proportionate approach is needed to deal with this virus. This will be crucial to our ability to remain open in regional Victoria as we fight COVID-19. Localised restrictions are needed to ensure our survival, not only from the virus but also from the broader economic and social impact of continual lockdowns. Regional Victoria, where more than 1.6 million people live and work to provide food and fibre to the world, has been shackled and gutted by these repeated restrictions. Regional townships such as Mildura and Horsham have shown they are willing to do their part and have done so effectively when COVID cases have occurred. There has been no community spread from these events. This has been a gold standard response, and I commend the people of Mallee.</span>

To know her was to love her. Lina was an incredible person, someone who was motivated to better the lives of people, someone who always fought tirelessly for the marginalised. Lina's work with Asian Women at Work was integral to my community. For over the past 20 years Lina dedicated her time to supporting the needs of migrant women, helping them to settle here, connecting them with supportive organisations and educating them on workplace rights. Beyond this, Lina was incredibly active in our community. She was a fierce advocate for the respect of human rights, in particular drawing attention to the human rights violations in the Philippines. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;" />Lina's fighting spirit was with her to the end. She was the kind of person who, even through her chemotherapy treatments, continued to support women locally to navigate the challenges of the current lockdown in Sydney, and she did this from her hospital bed. She was without doubt the very best of what makes us an incredible community. Her life has made a difference for the better. My deepest sympathies go to her husband, Jega, her children, Miko and Natasha, and all those who loved her.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  My electorate of Lilley is iconic, hosting many iconic things, among them the Royal Flying Doctor Service airport hub for Queensland. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has been providing vital emergency and primary healthcare funding since 1928. They care for one Australian every two minutes. In the pandemic they have been doing invaluable work rolling out the vaccine. So far they've delivered vaccines to 25 clinics and administered vaccines to more than 2,000 Queenslanders. The Royal Flying Doctor Service are held dearly in the hearts of many Australians, so much so that Jericho Road Clothing—an iconic Brisbane label built by Chloe and Kate—have just launched their Outback Skies collection, which this work shirt is part of. One hundred per cent of profits will be donated directly to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Legends! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jericho Road Clothing's initiative is a great and very sartorially satisfying way for ordinary Australians to contribute to the work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. But this service is also in need of more federal infrastructure funding from this place to continue to service regional Queensland with better hub infrastructure. So I implore the Morrison government to reach into the Building Better Regions Fund, do the right thing and support the Royal Flying Doctor Service to continue to support Australians in need.</span>

So many local sports men and women have done our region and our country proud and really delivered some fantastic results. This includes Riley Fitzsimmons in the K-4 1,000 metres; Nicola McDermott in the high jump; Kye Rowles in the men's football; Lachlan Tame in the men's canoe sprint, K-2 1,000 metres; Charlie Hunter in the 800-metre run; Lachlan Wales in men's football; Ellie Carpenter and Kyah Simon in women's football; Faith Nathan in women's rugby sevens; Dylan Littlehales in para-canoe; Matt Dawson in field hockey; and Ruon Tongyik in men's football. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every representative did Australia proud and has a story worth shouting from the rooftops. Two such examples include Charlie Hunter, who represented Australia in the men's 800-metre run. Charlie grew up in Terrigal and started his career at Duffys Oval at Terrigal's Little Athletics and then at Gosford Little Athletics. Charlie comes from a sporting family, with his mother representing Australia in two sports and his uncle being a renowned Australian cricketer. He made it to the semifinals for the 800 metres—a fantastic effort. Tascott local Nicola McDermott was introduced to athletics when she was seven and quickly found her niche in high jump. Nicola always had a dream to go to the Olympics. She not only made it, but she won a silver medal and broke the Australian national record. Nicola, you've done yourself, your family and your whole community proud. I want to congratulate each and every athlete who represented our region and our nation at the Olympics. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I recently had the opportunity to meet with Jenson and his father, Richard Galvin, to discuss Jenson's passion for helping others. In March, Jenson wrote to the Prime Minister about his experiences with the Youth Philanthropy Initiative of the Melbourne Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation and the potential to take it national. Working with schools, the initiative encourages students to submit proposals and assess the worthy charities for a $10,000 donation. Through Brighton Grammar, Jenson participated in and, in his own words, acknowledged that philanthropy has made him 'a more caring and considerate person, as well as a more employable and functioning member of an evolving society'. This is not the only charity work that Jenson does, including his work with the food drive Ute Full of Food, which stocks food banks for homeless Melburnians.</span>

There's the surge in mums' voices about distracting the preschooler long enough so her older sister can do her videoconference in peace; or that three of the four kids are able to knuckle down but one is really struggling; or that one boy is completely disconnected from friends and feeling very low. And that's without any extra load of learning difficulties or disabilities. It's not factoring in the teachers with their own kids on top of their classes. And let's not forget the new parents who are spending the first months of their babies' lives disconnected from all the support that I took for granted—no playgroup, no other mums to commiserate or celebrate with and no grandparents to change a nappy. It's a lonely time for many. They're in long vaccine queues but they're rising to the challenge. As a mum, I know you're doing all you can to get your kids through this. You need to know that it's enough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My advice to everybody is to reach out to a mum; that phone call could make all the difference. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  There are few more idyllic spots than Denmark on the south coast of my electorate, and I rise to recognise someone who has done more than most to protect Denmark's outstanding natural environment. On Thursday night, Basil Schur took out the 2021 Australian Government Individual Landcarer Award at the National Landcare Awards, which were streamed nationwide from Sydney. I've known Basil for years and can vouch for his steadfast commitment to the environment of southern WA. In 2020 he was named Denmark's Citizen of the Year for his decades of caring for the land. The year before that he took out the Individual Landcare Award for Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am absolutely thrilled that Basil has now achieved a local, state and national trifecta, this time in recognition of his wide array of environmental work across WA's southern regions. For three incredible decades, Basil has worked within the community to initiate planning, conservation and restoration for rivers and wetlands. He established the Denmark Wetland Centre and was instrumental in coordinating the Balijup Fauna Sanctuary in Tenterden. There, he worked with landowners to fence 110 hectares of native bushland in the Kent River catchment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Basil's work has seen a rise in the number of southern brown bandicoots, or quenda, and other native wildlife in the sanctuary. Basil has also run regular citizen science workshops, ensuring that his wealth of landcare expertise is spread far and wide and shared with future generations of Western Australians. Well done, Basil.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  In 2019, the Prime Minister tried to get Brian Houston invited to a state dinner at the White House, which he was attending as part of an official visit to the United States. That invitation was rejected by the Trump administration. The rejection first came to light thanks to the reporting of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span>, a serious newspaper of record. But when Australian journalists quizzed this Prime Minister about it his response was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He fobbed off legitimate questions for months and, along the way, he kept shifting the goalposts. His department cited national security as a reason not to talk about the Prime Minister's attempt to get Brian Houston invited to the White House—no doubt it was embarrassing, but it wasn't a matter of national security. Later, the Prime Minister said he had refused to discuss it because he did not want to be distracted by it. He claimed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… at the end of the day, it was not a significant matter …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the Prime Minister's judgement about who he invites to the White House is very significant indeed. When he finally, belatedly, admitted the truth, the Prime Minister, true to character, wanted to be given credit for doing something he should have done much, much earlier.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that secrecy is the first instinct of this Prime Minister. The question is: why did he consider it so important in this case? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (14<span class="HPS-Time">:02</span>):  I want to extend the country's congratulations and thanks to our Australian Olympic team, as well as to the organisers of the Tokyo Olympic Games, for what has been a truly extraordinary fortnight. These were the games that the world needed, and Japan and the Olympic movement delivered those games. These were the games that Australia needed, and our magnificent athletes have delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had wonderful Olympic Games before—Melbourne and Sydney, of course, on home soil, and Athens, amongst many others—but these games lifted us in a very different way, at a very crucial time for our nation. The Australian Olympic team generally has inspired us. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> got it right with their headline 'Good sports and good at sport', achievement and character going hand in hand. The achievements are for the history books, and they tell part of the story: sixth on the medal tally; 17 gold, seven silver, 22 bronze—equalling, with Athens, our best ever gold medal tally; 99 individual members of the Australian team taking home medals across 15 sports and 20 disciplines. Olympic heroes and champions, indeed, for the ages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chief amongst them, the mighty Emma McKeon, now atop the pantheon of Australian and world sport: four gold, three bronze—the most medals by an Australian at an Olympic Games, and only the second woman in history to win that many. Now with more Olympic medals than any other Australian Olympian, Emma was joined in triumph by Kaylee McKeown and Ariarne Titmus, our queen machine of the pool. Kaylee, with three gold medals and a bronze, inspired by the memory of her late father, who she lost last year. Ariarne, with two gold, a silver and a bronze. I spoke to Ariarne's and Emma's parents during the games, and, like all the families we saw during the games, they were proud of their loved ones long before their Tokyo triumphs. The pride isn't in the medals, though the medals represent great achievement; the pride is in seeing the emergence of such determination, dedication, discipline and sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be under any illusion. All of our athletes made great sacrifices in their careers, their finances and their studies to go to Tokyo, sacrifices compounded by the delays and the restrictions of a gruelling pandemic, but they all found ways through to make their way to Tokyo. The gold medallists: Matthew Wearn, Mathew Belcher and Will Ryan in the sailing; the paddlers Tom Green and Jean van der Westhuyzen, and the incredible Jess Fox at her third Olympics; Zac Stubblety-Cook, and the women's relay teams in the swimming; Logan Martin in the inaugural freestyle BMX competition; and 18-year-old Keegan Palmer in skateboarding. And after 25 years without an 'oarsome foursome' we ended up with two in one day—the men's and the women's fours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were others who moved us in ways, of course, we won't forget: Peter Bol, the 800-metre runner, who expressed so passionately his love for this country—a truly great Australian story; Harry Garside, the boxer who learned ballet and won Australia's first medal in the sport in 33 years; and Skye Nicolson, devastated at her narrow loss in the quarter finals at the women's boxing. We spoke on the phone, and Skye said, 'I'm so proud to be representing my beautiful country.' I was in awe of what our athletes gave. Genevieve Gregson ruptured her Achilles on the last hurdle of the steeplechase. It was her birthday. Gen described to all of us how to deal with setbacks, saying, 'It's raw; it's hard; I'm not okay, yet I will be.' Saya Sakakibara in the BMX was competing not just for her country but for her brother Kai, who was seriously injured while competing last year. In Saya's race, another competitor's bike touched her wheel, and she crashed. She thought she'd let everyone down. But Kai put it best when he said: 'Saya, I know this isn't what you wanted, but either way I'm really proud. Let's go prepare for the next one.' We echo Kai's thoughts and words. We saw that resilience with Patrick Tiernan, giving his all in the 10,000 metres and pushing his way through every mental barrier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were others too who inspired us: Jian Fang Lay, a six-time Olympian in table tennis, and Andrew Hoy, who came back for his eighth Olympics—at 62, our oldest medallist yet and an inspiration to many of us in this chamber, I suspect. We know there are big things ahead for Rohan Browning and his mullet, as well as our high jump silver medallist, Nicola McDermott—who I spoke to today—with her remarkable sense of calm. All the teams—the Kookaburras continued on their incredible journey; the Matildas delivered their best performance yet; and the Boomers, led by the great leader Patty Mills, brought us ever so much closer to that Everest in men's basketball, and we have the foothold in it now as a result of his leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for me, the moment that really captured these games was the decathlon—the final event, the 1,500 metres, and two Australians, Ash Moloney and Cedric Dubler. Ash had the chance at a medal; Cedric didn't. So Cedric decided to back his teammate. He was on his tail, pushing him on. We could see the intensity. The lip-readers could make out the words, and I don't think they were parliamentary! I'm sure the image of Ash and Cedric heading round the track will be iconic—Cedric beckoning his teammate, 'Keep going, go faster, give more, don't give up.' That's the story of these games: keep going, don't tire, don't give up, do what you have to do, focus on the finish line ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world owes a great debt to the government of Japan, to the Olympic movement and, in particular, to Prime Minister Suga and the Japanese people, who we commend for their great staging of these games. They persevered with these games, and they were vindicated. The critics said there would be no atmosphere. Instead, we rediscovered that sport isn't about the crowds; it's about the heart and soul of those who compete, which was on display. We saw that at the Tokyo Olympics, and we will see it in the Paralympics, which we look forward to, which are now only weeks away. We wish our Paralympian athletes the same success that those who have already competed in the Tokyo Olympics have had. There will be stories there that echo these. This is a country that I think celebrates the Paralympics like few others. We stand our heroes of the Paralympics against and with all of our other great athletes in this nation. We celebrate them with great pride and we wish them all the best. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The focus on the athletes is what we, of course, will take ahead as we move now to the Brisbane 2032 Games—which kicked off the games for us—and we commend all of those who have been involved in that endeavour. I have no doubt that kids pretending to swim in their living rooms while watching the Olympics or doing high jumps, as we saw last night, over a sack of pillows are watching and thinking that it may well be them in 2032. It's great that they now have that hope to look forward to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the character of the Australian Olympic team is shared by the Australians that they have represented. Australians have the grit, the determination and the character to prevail. There may not be gold medals, as I wrote recently, for being a single parent, for running a small business, for doing the night shift in an emergency department or aged-care facility, for being out there at the vaccination hubs or for volunteering for your local surf lifesaving club or your local bushfire brigade, but, if there were, Australia would be at the top of the gold medal tally, I'm quite certain. This is why I'm so confident Australia will pull through this current challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. We won't let it beat us. We won't let our frustration get the better of us. We won't let negativity overwhelm our optimism. We will urge each other on. We will put our heads down and keep pressing on, and we will succeed. That is the Australian way.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  'You got to try and reach for the stars or try and achieve the unreachable,' so said the great Cathy Freeman, who summed up the Olympic experience. These Olympics were a beacon of hope in a world where people needed something to smile and cheer about. And Australians certainly had full bottle on that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw so many young Australians reach the unreachable in the past fortnight, so many who followed Cathy's path to personal triumph. I say to every one of our Olympians: you were selected with good reason, and, when you got to Tokyo, you did our nation proud. You performed magnificently as athletes, as human beings and as representatives of your country. You gave us demonstration after demonstration of everything that is great about the Olympics. We saw talent. We saw determination. We saw records broken. We saw personal bests beaten. We saw some dreams realised, some not quite. We saw physical and mental grit. We saw dignity and humility. We saw humour. What it all added up to was true sportsmanship—and, indeed, 17 gold medals, including Emma McKeon becoming our greatest Olympian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But some of the sweetest moments weren't ones about outright victory. There was the extraordinary story of Peter Bol, once a refugee and an almost accidental athlete. Running fourth in the 800 metres, he lifted all of Australia. Then there was, for me, something I'll never forget: the wonderful 10,000-metre runner, Patrick Tiernan, falling over about 100 metres or so from the finish line, but getting up and making sure that he finished. There was nothing left in the tank, but there he crossed the line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patty Mills and the Boomers showed us the sweetness of bronze. He gave that wonderful interview after the game where he said he looked forward to hanging his bronze medal at his mum's and dad's, who had given up so much for him to make it. He is a proud Indigenous Australian who has never forgotten where he came from, and a proud ambassador for our nation as well as his people. After that came the interview with Andrew Gaze on TV, with Andrew trying to hold back tears and then giving up, and the wonderful exuberance of feeling, quite rightly, that he was part of it—and indeed his dad, Lindsay, talking about when he began coaching, when there were just 100 or 200 registered players in basketball throughout the whole of Australia, and how that sport has been built and how this bronze medal will help to build it even further in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was Nicola McDermott, soaring so magnificently to silver in the high jump—and writing in her diary after every jump, so that she's got contemporaneous notes there for the future—and Ash Moloney showing us what may be an amazing new dawn with his bronze medal in the decathlon, egged on by Cedric Dubler in the last 1,500 metres. What mateship, what commitment and what goodwill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind all these amazing athletes we got glimpses of sacrifices made, of myriad costs of dedication. We saw the guidance of coaches and, above all, the love and support of families. We saw those broadcasts back to rooms in Australia around the country of people cheering on their loved ones. From the bigger Australian family, may all our Olympians feel our love, our support and our gratitude. Thanks for lifting us up. Thanks for your effort. Thanks for your achievement. Thanks also to those people in the administration, including the Australian administration and, of course, the great John Coates, who's gone on to play an important role in the IOC and will always be seen, quite rightly, as an Australian representative. John, you are a good mate and you are a great Australian who has served your country and served sport well indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A big thanks as well to the government and the people of Japan for hosting these games. It was a big call to bring on the games and to maintain them, but you've done the world a big favour. We look forward to watching the Paralympics over coming weeks, again an incredible inspiration every time they are held. We wish all of our athletes all the best in the coming weeks. I think that during a difficult time, with most of Australia locked down, the TV ratings did pretty well. But it is something that, at a very tough time for Australians, gave all of Australia something to watch, something to smile about and something to cheer—and for that we thank you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has set out an agreed national plan to chart Australia's way out of this crisis and to ensure that we can live with the virus into the future. That plan has been set out, and it focuses our efforts as a country forward. Each day, we are taking a step further, closer to that goal. Each day, we are getting further along this journey. In fact, in the seven-day period up until yesterday, Sunday, 1.3 million doses were delivered—in a one week period. That is almost the population of the city of Adelaide in just one week. That is the rate of vaccination now being achieved in the national vaccination program. We've overcome the challenges that we had early in the program and are turning the corner, to ensure that Australians can move forward on the path ahead. The world is dealing with the third wave of the delta variant, and that has changed the way that we have to address that at all levels within this country. The success of regrettable but necessary measures that have been put in place by the states, with lockdowns where outbreaks occur, is vital to ensuring that we enter the next phase, at 70 per cent vaccinated, in the best possible shape, because the fewer cases we go into phase b with, the better off we all are.</span>

                  </a>  That's why those measures are so important, but they are assisted by the vaccine program, to ensure that New South Wales, in particular, can move through this current lockdown as quickly as it possibly can. But it must be effective, and that's why we have acted to ensure more vaccines, whether it be in New South Wales, in Victoria or in Queensland. We've been able to work with each of those state and territory governments to provide hundreds of thousands of brought-forward vaccines to support those states that have been dealing with those challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's backed up by the economic supports. Through the COVID disaster assistance payment, almost $2 billion—indeed by now it would be above $2 billion—has been provided in direct economic supports to Australians who have lost hours in work because of these most recent lockdowns. That is to almost one million Australians directly impacted. That support has been directly provided. And we continue to work with the states and territories, who are delivering their business supports, and we are meeting those costs with them in those programs fifty-fifty, shoulder to shoulder with the state and territory governments. Seventy and 80 per cent targets for vaccination double dose in this country are achievable. We are taking big steps towards that each and every day, and I thank Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Sixty-seven of those are in New South Wales. In addition to that, 30 lives have been lost this year to COVID, and 941 in total have been lost. Every single one of those deaths is a terrible tragedy for those families. It is a terrible tragedy. But we also know that in this country we have been able to prevent and avoid more than 30,000 deaths because of the collective actions of Australians in this country and the responses that have been put in place. Overseas, people don't just know someone who might have had COVID; they know someone who has died of COVID. In too many cases, they know many people who have died of COVID. In this country, our experience has been very different. And it hasn't just been the saving of lives which has been so paramount in our thinking as a government as we have responded, as we have continued to bring Australians together, to bring the states and territories together, as we have done throughout, on over 50 occasions over the course of this pandemic. But it has also been about saving livelihoods. There have been more than 30,000 lives saved and a million Australians back in jobs since last year's COVID recession.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of these lockdowns, I know one thing will happen, and that is that the Australian economy will surge back. I know that because that is exactly what occurred after the last COVID recession, after the last impact. We will see how things pan out over the months ahead, but I know this: the supports that we put in to support the Australian economy—whether it was last year through JobKeeper and the COVID supplement and the cash-flow boost and the many supplements we put in place—saw the Australian economy through and ensured that we were one of the few countries in the world that had an economy larger on the other side of the pandemic than at the beginning and more people in work than before. At the same time we had prevented, through collective actions, 30,000 Australians, at least, from perishing. That puts Australia in a league amongst very few countries in the world today. It remains now for us to complete that job as we move towards the end of this year and we see 70 per cent of our country vaccinated, hopefully 80 per cent. I want to thank Australians for, each and every hour, going out there and getting that vaccination, as we hit rates of vaccination which are up there with the world's best. As we are going through these most recent weeks—</span>

It's a very difficult time for Australians right now. We've got millions of people who are in lockdown in New South Wales, in Victoria and, indeed, in Cairns today as well, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The economy will bounce back as it has done so before. We are there providing significant economic support in partnership with the state governments. We have announced income support for workers who have lost hours of work of between $450 or $750 a week. Around $2 billion has already been paid out to around one million Australians, including 700,000 Australians who reside in New South Wales. Today, legislation passed the parliament to make those COVID disaster payments tax-free. There are now tax-free COVID disaster payments of $450 and $750. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also business support. Today, in partnership with the Marshall government, we announced a $40 million package, around $40 million of support for around 20,000 businesses in South Australia. Businesses in the tourism sector, businesses in the hospitality sector, businesses in the recreation sector in South Australia will get economic support. We've also reached an agreement with the Victorian government. We are providing hundreds of millions of dollars to businesses across that state. In New South Wales, we have a fifty-fifty arrangement, where businesses with a turnover of up to $250 million who have lost 30 per cent or more of turnover or seen a decline of 30 per cent or more in turnover will be eligible for payments of up to $100,000 a week. This is significant economic support and this economic support will help Australian small- and medium-size businesses get to the other side. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when we were facing an unemployment rate that could have reached as high as 15 per cent, our economy bounced back. Today in the most recent data it was at 4.9 per cent. We heard from the Reserve Bank just last week in its statement of monetary policy that the recovery has been quicker and stronger, and that Australia's experience is that when restrictions are lifted spending recovers strongly. We've also heard from Standard &amp; Poor's that, in its words, it 'doesn't expect the current lockdowns across Australia to weigh heavily on the nation's AAA rating'. We know our Australian economy is sound and will recover strongly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's an important initiative, and I thank the states and territories for their cooperation in working with the Prime Minister for that outcome.</span>

The birthplace of democracy, Athens, is on fire and so is the west coast of the United States. Europe is flooding and, here in Australia, our own bitter experience means that we know the world is in a climate emergency. Tonight the world's scientists will release the latest IPCC report, warning that the world is heating faster than feared and that we may cross catastrophic tipping points from which there is no return and hit 1½ degrees in just a few years. Prime Minister, your 2030 targets are a death sentence for our country. Will you heed this warning and join the US and the UK by at least doubling our 2030 climate targets? Or will you keep failing to protect Australia and its people from the climate crisis?</span>

That's what we're seeking to do, and we're seeking to do that by using technologies not taxes.

All of this is designed to ensure that our economy transitions over the course of the next 30 years and to ensure it plays a highly successful role, not only ensuring that we're addressing climate change but, at the same time, ensuring that our economy is strong and successful, particularly in regional areas of this country—that they are not sacrificed at the altar.

Our emissions have fallen by 20 per cent since 2005, far exceeding those who've come forward with big claims about what they may achieve in the future. Australia is achieving emissions reductions right now: a 20 per cent reduction in emissions since 2005. Between 2005 and 2019, the last year of comparable data, Australia reduced emissions faster than Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the United States and the G20 and OECD averages.

Our government is backing them up because our government believes that you can get emissions down, you can keep electricity prices down and you can address the future industrial needs of this country in a way that is complementary, and that you don't have to sacrifice one for the other. I can tell you, our government will not go down the taxes route. Those opposite might. We will not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The member is correct: last week there were 1.33 million vaccinations in Australia. 1.33 million Australians, or almost the entire population of Adelaide, as the Prime Minister said, stepped forward to be vaccinated. We believe it is a record for vaccinations for any week for any form of vaccine in Australian history. That's a testimony to the work of Australians, it's recognition of their commitment to the program and it's recognition that as the supplies increased so too has the capacity of Australians to receive those vaccines.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that has shown is that they are stepping up; that they are passionate about being vaccinated. Around the world we see the horrors of the pandemic every day. In the last day alone, over 470,000 cases and, again, over 8,000 lives lost. We're seeing these numbers grow again in another global wave of the pandemic driven by the delta variant. Against that background, we know that Australia has not been immune, but that we have been overwhelmingly shielded from so much of the agony that has ravaged the world. As the Prime Minister mentioned, we now have 941 lives lost in Australia, but 30,000 lives have been saved against the OECD average. The things that we have done as a nation have been the rings of containment of borders, testing, tracing, distancing and vaccination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, in terms of vaccination, we've reached 13.7 million total vaccinations. That's over 9.1 million first vaccinations. What we also see is 4.6 million second vaccinations. Indeed, what we've seen now is well over seven million AstraZeneca vaccinations. I want to thank the member for Maribyrnong, who has been a very strong supporter of the AstraZeneca program. There are others who've taken different views. He's been a strong supporter of that program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of those who have advocated for this vaccination program. What we are seeing is that we have now passed 75 per cent, or three-quarters, of the over-60s in this nation. We've now passed 81 per cent of the over-70s in this nation. These vaccinations are saving lives and protecting lives. There's more work to be done, but every week more Australians are stepping forward. In the last week alone, a population almost the size of Adelaide was vaccinated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

At this point in time, on the latest advice that I received from the National Incident Room shortly before coming to question time, we have had 17,311 disability residents. That represents approximately 63.6 per cent of residents. In addition to that, the total number of residents who've received second doses is 12,132, or 44.5 per cent of residents.</span>

These elements are in place.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note one very important fact, and that is that the loss of life amongst disability residents in Australia is less than the average of the loss of life for all Australians. It has been one of our singular national achievements. There are many, many people around Australia to be thanked for that, but we want to thank all of those carers and workers and all of those who've assisted with the vaccination program.</span>

Disability and Indigenous Australians have overwhelmingly been able to be kept safe. These results have meant those communities have been even more protected than the average in Australia, and that's something for which we are thankful and grateful.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. He represents a very rich and proud agricultural area. It makes a significant contribution to Australian agriculture, which is a $66 billion industry. That is despite the droughts and the reduced flows down the Murray River that that region has experienced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the challenges we naturally face in Australian agriculture, we adopt technology, science and research more quickly than nearly any other industry in the country. We do this because we have to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, as part of the government's Ag2030 plan, one of the seven key pillars that we're investing in—to ensure we build resilience in but also grow Australian agriculture and support the over 330,000 jobs in agriculture today—is innovation, the new pillar of Australian agriculture, and that's through some reforms of our 15 commodity research and development corporations, whether they be cotton, grains or dairy, to make sure we get back to first principles—value to the levy payer, value to the taxpayer—by removing the duplication of research across those organisations and commercialising them, getting a rate of return on the investment of over $1.1 billion a year that the Australian taxpayer and farmers contribute to having the cutting-edge technology to give our farmers the tools they need to continue to grow agriculture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's also about supporting it in a digital sense, and I'm proud to say that we launched the growAG website. That's about bringing together all the research that these 15 research and development corporations are producing, and not only making sure that there is no duplication but saying to the world what opportunities are here in Australia. Already we are seeing international players wanting to partner with our research and development corporations and investing in jobs here in innovation in agriculture. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also creating physical platforms: eight drought innovation hubs, one of which is in Nichols at Dookie college. This is about making sure that we have investment in infrastructure out near our primary producers so that the extension and adoption of that technology will continue—to ensure also that they are able to dictate the type of research that's important to them, not just for drought but also through these research and development corporations, getting value for money for that $1.1 billion that is placed out there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of the things we haven't done well is the commercialisation of the best and brightest in this world. That's why last week we announced programs with $34 million worth of grants to incentivise those ideas—to go from ideas to actual adoption and commercialisation, to get a return that will be reinvested back into our most precious asset, our human capital, who are out there in the new pillar of agriculture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about putting the environment around agriculture to continue to grow and to reach its goal of $100 billion by 2030.</span>

Now, that is the right thing to do. And, as we struggled against that COVID-19 pandemic, we set out a program of restrictions that could be eased in different phases as we struggled against the then known variants of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, as we know, as the pandemic has progressed, new and different variants have emerged. These are things that neither I nor the premiers, the chief ministers—indeed, in the great wisdom of the Leader of the Opposition—would have been able to have the foresight to know which turns the pandemic might take. </span>

Now, on occasion, the pandemic, the virus, gets the better of those plans. But we will continue to make them and we'll continue to move towards them and implement them and we will encourage Australians to engage with us in that so we can indeed chart our path out. And it may well be the case that further strains of this pandemic may impose further blows. But, I tell you what, Australians will respond. They won't hope for the worst like the Labor Party in this pandemic. They won't seek to take political opportunity of the pandemic.</span>

She's been a strong advocate for lower taxes, including for the 25,000 businesses across her electorate that are eligible for the immediate expensing provisions, and more than 50,000 taxpayers across her electorate are getting a tax cut as a result of policies that we on this side of the House have supported.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put in place, we have legislated, significant structural tax reform, including the abolition of a whole tax bracket, the 37 cents in the dollar tax bracket, to see people who earn between $45,000 and $200,000 pay a marginal rate of tax of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Indeed, if you are a teacher earning $60,000 a year, you are paying $6,480 less tax this year as a result of our plan. And, if you are a truckie on $90,000 a year, you are paying $7,020 less tax over the course of the period that we have introduced these tax reforms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put in place immediate expensing for businesses. We've also put in place the loss carry-back measures. We've also put in place a patent box for businesses in the medical and biotech sector, who can get a concessional company tax rate of 17 cents in the dollar.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm asked: are there 'any alternative approaches'. And we know that the member for Rankin and the member for McMahon hoodwinked the member for Maribyrnong at the election and came out with $387 billion of higher taxes. And then, as Australia was winning gold in the pool, they quietly dumped negative gearing and some of their other higher taxes. But no-one believes them. And no-one was prouder of those tax increases than the member for Rankin. Of course, they also opposed our legislated stage 3 tax cuts. The member for Rankin called them offensive. He said they were the least fair, the least equitable and the least effective. He went on Sky TV and was asked by Kieran Gilbert: 'So you didn't get rolled on this particular issue?' The member for Rankin: 'Of course not, Kieran.' This is better, in terms of Labor supporting our tax cuts. The member for Rankin said, 'This was my recommendation to the shadow cabinet, to the expenditure review committee. In all the forums I've participated in recent times I've made it clear that it is my preference. This is in my portfolio, and this is the recommendation I made to colleagues.' No-one believes you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Why does the Prime Minister constantly change his plans instead of delivering them? Last year it was 'reopening by Christmas' and 'we're at the front of the queue'. In June it was 'vaccine horizons', in early July it was 'a new deal with a four-phase plan', two weeks ago it was a different four-phase plan and last week it was a fast-track vaccination policy 18 months into the pandemic. How many plans will the Prime Minister announce before he delivers one?</span>

What we have done as a country and what we have done as a government is be responsive to ensure that we can address the many challenges that have come from COVID-19 and do so as a federation and in a way that has saved more than 30,000 lives and put a million people back into work.

We are overcoming that and we have turned the corner. Australia is on the path to living with this virus. We will be on that path and achieving that at the same time as we are ensuring that we have had one of the lowest fatality rates from COVID-19 in the world and one of the most successful economic records through the COVID-19 crisis, including maintaining a AAA credit rating, despite the significant investments we have made to keep Australians in work and to keep Australia moving forward.</span>

The Morrison government is absolutely focused on making Australia a place that is free from violence against women and their children. We demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ending family and domestic violence in the 2021-22 budget, where we made the largest-ever commitment to women's safety with a $1.1 billion package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This work must continue, and it must continue with real recognition that home is not always a safe place to be, particularly in a global pandemic. Lockdowns and health orders across the country mean that women and their families are facing new challenges. But a lockdown does not, and should not, ever mean that you cannot escape violence. This government, through our partnerships, is continuing to provide support to vulnerable families, including direct financial support. This year's budget included a new escaping violence payment, which will provide immediate financial assistance to support women leaving a violent relationship. There's also $12.6 million for additional projects under the Safe Places initiative, to upgrade, purchase and make fit-for-purpose emergency accommodation for women and children. And we will continue to focus on initiatives like Safe Places for regional and rural women, where there's often much less access to emergency accommodation and where it can be much harder to seek help in a community where everyone knows you and you know everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The upcoming women's safety summit on 6 and 7 September is a very important event managed by the Minister for Women and the Minister for Women's Safety, in the other place. It will be a critical step in developing the next national plan. The summit will provide us not only with an opportunity to shine a light on the terrible violence that women from all walks of life experience but, importantly, with a chance to listen to the victim-survivors, the experts and those on the frontline, who face these awful challenges daily. The summit will discuss key issues for women's safety, including financial security, policing, the justice responses, sexual violence; and the often unique challenges facing, for example, migrant communities and Indigenous Australians. The summit will put these voices on the national stage to ensure that these experiences contribute to what must be a comprehensive and effective national plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government and I know this whole parliament remains resolute in the task of ending violence against women and their children, no matter what form it takes. Through our budget package, and through the next national action plan, we will all continue to work towards this goal.</span>

I refer to his press conference on Thursday, where he said five times in 50 seconds that ministers made the decisions on the commuter car parks program. If the Prime Minister was telling the truth last week, how does he explain the letters he signed on 11 January and 10 April 2019, in which he provided funding for 38 car park projects?</span>

The Prime Minister, through the 'hunting licence process' that members opposite may be familiar with, through the ERC process, signs off on a whole range of recommendations that are made within their authority by ministers. That's the normal process. This program goes to something very important. This program, that we have supported—and I will quote you someone who was very supportive of these projects, saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, we know that the pandemic has accelerated this year. Sometimes it's lost that there were approximately 80 million cases last year and there have been over 120 million cases this year alone, so far, as part of a global pandemic. There were 1.8 million lives lost last year, and there have been nearly 2½ million lives lost already this year. The pandemic that so many predicted would finish within one year has accelerated and expanded globally during the course of this second year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, we've maintained, extended and expanded our long-term national health plan. As part of that, COVID protection has been fundamental; I went through some of those elements earlier on. Critically, we have put in place arguably the most significant reform of Medicare since its formation with the creation of telehealth. Over 68 million consultations have now been carried out. That's had a profound effect on the delivery of health services around Australia not just in response to COVID but on an enduring basis. It has helped transform the way that health services will be provided to older Australians, to parents with young children and in particular to people in rural, remote and Indigenous Australia. At the same time one of the things we've had to do is ensure powerful mental health supports. We've not seen an increase in the suicide rate, despite predictions, and that's an immense national achievement. But we have not seen a decrease in the suicide rate, despite all efforts. So there's more work to be done on that front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we have done is to put in place mental health support in the pandemic, which has inevitably saved lives and protected lives. That has been expanded just on the weekend with the extension of the HeadtoHelp program in Victoria and the expansion of it to New South Wales, with 10 new clinics, including seven across Sydney and three across rural and regional New South Wales. But, at the same time, we've expanded Medicare, going from $19 billion when we came in to $30 billion, $31 billion, $32 billion and $33 billion over the forward estimates. We've seen, in the last year, 30 million diagnostic services and we've seen well over 100 million pathology services that have all saved lives and protected lives. And there has been expansion of the PBS, with a new drug commencing on 1 August: Evrysdi for spinal muscular atrophy, which will give a hundred children a chance at a better life, a longer life and a safer life. All of these things are saving lives— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

When will the Prime Minister actually explain his role in the process instead of having other ministers defend it for him?</span>

That is not an unusual process. It is a process followed by previous prime ministers—previous Labor prime ministers and previous Liberal prime ministers.

And, of course, she has provided great support to our businesses.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of the pandemic, our government acted very decisively on our international borders. Without a doubt, this has helped to spare us from the worst impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we now face a significant challenge: the delta variant is one of the most significant challenges that we have had to face during this pandemic, not just here in Australia but right across the world. As we ramp up our vaccine delivery, we know that we have to remain vigilant. So while COVID-19 has certainly challenged all of us, Australia's travel exemption regime has kept us safe from widespread COVID transmission and that's why our borders remain effectively closed. That being said, we can't seal ourselves off from the rest of the world. We need to bring vaccines in, we need to keep our postal links and our cargo links open, and we need skilled workers. We need those skilled workers to support our industries here in Australia. We know that, whilst we have many skilled workers here, we still need to look at bringing more skilled workers in to supplement that workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity now to thank the Australian Border Force for the great work they have done, day after day. They have been particularly efficient at ensuring the vital supplies like our Pfizer vaccines are expedited. This has ensured that we have been able to ramp up the delivery of our vaccine strategy, with more than a million doses now being given every week. On several days last week, there were record numbers of vaccinations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our four-stage plan, our national plan, has set out a pathway back to normal life. We want to make sure that Australians are able to travel as freely as they possibly can, and work is now well underway, with the Australian Border Force, with the Australian Federal Police, and supported by many of our industries right across Australia, to make sure when it is appropriate and it is safe for us to open our borders we will be in a position to do so. I do thank those who have worked so hard during this pandemic to get us to the position where we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we are working towards that.</span>

Those despicable comments are not worthy of the office of Prime Minister and they are not true. What I am disappointed by and have spoken about repeatedly is the failure of this government to roll out the vaccine effectively and to do deals with five or six pharmaceutical companies, as was international best practice, and to roll out the vaccination effectively.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  [by video link] by leave—This report is about getting the skilled migration program ready for Australia's post-pandemic recovery, ensuring the program continues to serve Australia's needs. This inquiry was referred in February 2021, and in March we presented an interim report responding to immediate issues raised by the pandemic and how we might attract outstanding global talent to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia shut its borders to the world. As a result, more than half a million temporary migrants left our shores. Many of those temporary migrants were skilled migrants. Net overseas migration continues to be in negative territory, with a further 77,000 people expected to leave Australia in the 2021-22 financial year. The lack of skilled migrants and near record low unemployment have resulted in major skill shortages in the Australian economy, impacting the viability of business. Even despite lockdowns, today's job ad figures are up 38 per cent on pre-COVID rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received evidence of significant skill shortages emerging in the economy during the pandemic and the importance of skilled migrants in creating more jobs for Australians. Restaurateur Chris Lucas outlined the impact skill shortages are having on his business and its ability to create jobs. He told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We can't get the sushi chefs so we can't open the restaurant at all. Every sushi master that comes into the restaurant trains another five or six young Australian chefs, so it's starting to impact on our ability to train local people, to bring them up to local standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to address critical labour shortages during the pandemic, the government established the Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List, or PMSOL. In the interim report, the committee recommended that the government include a broader range of occupations on the PMSOL, including veterinarians, chefs and civil and electrical engineers. The government implemented these recommendations and have added more than 20 occupations to the PMSOL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report builds on the interim report and seeks to place the skilled migration program in context. The final report considers whether the skilled migration settings are serving Australia's interests, and its tradition of being selective about who we take in, while ensuring businesses can get the skills they need. Skilled migration is one of the policy levers that governments can use to address skill shortages. Other levers include higher education, vocational education and employment services programs. Andrew Kotzur, CEO of Kotzur silo manufacturers in regional New South Wales, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Migration, including skilled migration, is only one part—albeit an important one—of the solution. Business and government also need to work together to grow the skills base, to reduce other constraints—let's call that the red tape—and improve the productivity of our existing labour and capital assets. The inflexibility, complexity and cost of the current migration system means it is less efficient and less effective than it could be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found that there needs to be greater coordination of effort across governments and across jurisdictions to clearly identify and quantify labour shortages and put in place the most appropriate policy response to address them. The committee recommends the development of a national workforce plan led by a cross-jurisdictional interagency committee to provide a more comprehensive picture of workforce gaps in our economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key issue that emerged during the inquiry was the role of the skilled occupation lists that underpin Australia's skilled migration program. Such lists need to be more flexible and responsive to workforce shortages. It's become clear that the Australia and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations, better known as ANZSCO, which was never designed to be used for the skilled migration program, is out of date, not fit for purpose and should be replaced by an alternative system to be developed by the National Skills Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard that businesses are missing out on skilled migrants who may choose countries where the pathway to permanent residency is clearer. Ron Curry, from the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fact that these kinds of roles do not lead to permanent residency makes hiring senior and niche talent exceedingly difficult. The prospect of having to leave the country after a relatively short amount of time is less than enticing, in particular for the kind of senior talent that might've come with families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee therefore recommends providing skilled migrants a clearer pathway to permanency but with conditions and length of time to permanency varying depending on skill level. The committee has addressed issues around the administration of the skilled migration program. We've recommended more incentives for migrants to move to regional Australia; encouragement for the brightest international students to remain to address persistent skill shortages; and streamlining processes and service improvements in the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Labor have not dissented from this report, but they play politics in their additional comments. Labor's comments show they're not interested in regional Australia or the industries most affected by the economic impact of the pandemic. Labor remain divided on the 'no more migrants' dog whistling of Senator Keneally and the 'prioritise every non-economic migrant' of the member for Bruce. The coalition have spent years cleaning up Labor's mess. Labor's record on migration is bad, and we won't be taking advice from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I want to take the opportunity to thank all my committee colleagues and everyone who has made a submission, assisted with a site visit or given evidence to this inquiry, as well as the secretariat and Annie Phillips from my office, for their work on this report. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (15:25):  by leave—I'll keep my remarks as brief as possible but note that I'm speaking on behalf of the deputy chair and all other Labor members of the committee, and there is no opportunity in the Federation Chamber. At the outset, I thank the chair. I really want to make four points. Labor members agree with most although not all of the report, but that's not saying much. The first point is what a missed opportunity this report is. Australia has right now a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our migration program. The borders won't stay shut forever and neither should they, but, true to form, the government have squibbed it with this report. The report into skilled migration is a missed opportunity to rethink the program for when the borders open, to attract younger, highly skilled migrants and boost Australia's long-term economic prospects and wealth and get wages moving again. The recommendations, as outlined, are reactive, piecemeal administrative tinkering overall, lacking deep thought and real change—setting up a new committee, changing one coding system for another. People could well view this inquiry, at its worst, as a low-rent complaint shop run by the government to make it easier for employers to bring in migrants, yet doing nothing to boost Australian wages or our long-term national wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a nation built great by migration—permanent skilled migration overwhelmingly—and that should continue. Yet the government has not taken this as an opportunity for any deep thinking. Most tellingly, the report is completely and totally silent on the most substantive, thoughtful submission we received, from the Grattan Institute. I don't agree with all their ideas, but at least it was a deep attempt to provide an intellectual rigour and evidence based argument to boost the economic value Australia gets from migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support most of the recommendations about regional migration. I think it was a bit of a cheap shot from the chair—whom I consider a friend and who is actually a terrific chair of this committee—to suggest that Labor is not supportive of doing more for regional migration. But the report fails to address the integrity concerns regarding the global talent investment visa, which has been described by a former deputy secretary of immigration as a cronies' dream. The Grattan Institute also raised concerns regarding this program. It needs evaluation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make is that this report is a remarkable and blatant repudiation by government members of Peter Dutton's tenure as minister for immigration. It's a complete reversal of his changes to skilled migration and a vindication of Labor's criticism. I'll just point to three issues. Government members, rightly, have recommended restoring pathways to permanent migration. This is a huge shift in policy, ensuring that skilled visa holders can settle permanently in this country, send their kids to school, get an education, join their local community, start doing business and build careers. We heard from business after business, in regions and cities, how ridiculous it was that people could come here on some kind of permanent insecurity underclass program that leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and holds down wages. To their credit, the government members listened and rolled the former minister's changes. Secondly, they recommended fixing the confusion in the skills shortages lists, consolidating them back into one list and also, I hope, helping to deal with the lack of transparency about the rent-seeking mystery of who ends up on the list or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly—and this is my personal favourite—they recommended bringing back good old-fashioned customer service, having human beings available to liaise with industry and assist applicants with complex cases. OMG! It is long overdue but can only be achieved with additional resources, reversing some of the massive cuts—thousands of staff cut—by this government over many years, which the report conveniently fails to mention. It is constantly bemusing in committees, including this one, to watch government MPs get frustrated with public servants because they don't have the resources, yet they never take responsibility for the cuts that they've made. They fail to join the dots. The Public Service is not a magic pudding. It's a critical national institution that the government should steward and invest in, not attack and cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also—and I won't dwell on this—there have been the TAFE cuts. We need to invest more in the training system. TAFE is not doing its job. That's why we need migrants. That's what the evidence says. The government members never want to talk about the $3 billion of cuts to TAFE from Tony Abbott as Prime Minister onwards. If we could insert emojis into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, at this point I'd choose the eye roll and the facepalm. It is disappointing but telling that government members did not rule out privatisation or outsourcing of the visa system, and it's disappointing that throughout the inquiry government members kept pushing for more foreign workers to be allowed in at the expense of stranded Australians. I acknowledge there's a skills shortage in many parts of the country; no question, that's what the evidence says. But what I don't accept is that we write a blank cheque to foreign workers at the expense of 38,000 stranded Australians. That's the equation and that's the trade-off that they don't want to acknowledge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point is the most shocking revelation throughout the inquiry, and that is that no government department seems to know anything about or has done any analysis of the impact of temporary migration on Australian wages—nothing, zip, just blank looks. Home Affairs employment just looked confused. The Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold is the minimum salary you have to pay a temporary skilled migrant. It's been frozen for eight long years under this government, since the Prime Minister started off as the minister, at $53,900. It's a damaging freeze that's put downward pressure on wages, especially at the lower end of the market. Evidence was presented and there was significant media commentary throughout the inquiry. The Reserve Bank of Australia Governor talked about the impact of the migration program on wages. The McKell Institute issued a report. Freezing wages for eight long years creates not a floor in wages but a ceiling on wages for Australian workers and temporary work visa holders alike across several sectors, as the National Skills Commission data showed. The gap between the TSMIT and annual average wages is now $26,000. That's what happens when you freeze it. It's a gap of $26,000, which makes it far more attractive in many sectors to hire a temporary work visa holder, rather than an Australian worker—not everywhere, but in too many sectors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that Australia's post-pandemic migration program must deliver genuine highly skilled migrants, who are properly paid. It goes to the composition of the program. This is not an antimigrant comment. It goes to the composition of the program, which this report just didn't tackle. The committee, sort of to its credit, I think at the insistence of Labor members throughout the inquiry, was embarrassed into recommending a gradual increase in the TSMIT. That is a big shift, but it's not nearly enough. They've had a report from their own hand-picked expert since 2017, which they've failed to act on, saying raise and index the TSMIT. Significantly raising the TSMIT and ensuring its ongoing indexation would act as a safeguard against the types of temporary migrant worker exploitation and wage stagnation that have become systemic features of the pre-COVID labour market—deliberate features. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Predictably government members proposed to relax labour market testing in multiple places throughout the report. Labor members do not agree with the extent of the government's weakening of this important regime to ensure Australians always get a first go at jobs. We do acknowledge in the report—and this is a shift for us—the case in limited circumstances while the borders are closed for a change, and we pointed to those. It's not true to say what has been alleged by the government. But this is part of the Morrison government's ongoing push to undermine labour market testing, reducing incentives for business to employ Australian workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point is on international students. We welcome ideas to improve post-study work rights and pathways to permanency for the highest-performing international students in a critical skills shortage area. It's a little bit academic, given the state of the sector with the borders closed, but that's for another debate. We're especially pleased that the report acknowledges the situation of the current international student graduates, 485 visa holders, who are stuck offshore. Their visas are going to expire before they can use them. Labor members raised these issues with the department through the inquiry. These young people have made an investment in our country, and they were made a promise by our country of post-study work rights in return. With the borders closed, they're stuck offshore and there's no commitment—just radio silence from the government—to extend or allow renewal of the visas when they can safely come back. This is incredibly damaging to Australia's reputation in what was our fourth-biggest export sector, and denies Australia a proven source of highly skilled and well adapted young migrants. Australia can do much better by these graduates, and the government must urgently address this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the chair for the way he conducted the inquiry. As was noted, we agree with most of the recommendations, but they're a massive missed opportunity. I do not accept and strongly reject the characterisation that Labor is somehow anti-regions or anti-regional skilled workers. We've done our best in good faith to acknowledge those points, but the government have to acknowledge the trade-off with stranded Australians because of their failure to build quarantine facilities and failure to secure enough vaccines. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:34</span>):  by leave—I would like to thank the chair, Mr Julian Leeser, for the work he did as chair of this committee. It's an important report and the inquiry certainly got out into the regions, which was worthy. Certainly the information that we were able to take in as evidence was very important when it came to putting the recommendations together. I would also like to thank my coalition colleagues and my Labor colleagues in this committee. As I think most people in this House would understand when it comes to skilled migration and unskilled migration, the Labor Party come from a long way away from where we need to be. When we talked to businesses and industries about the actual real need that we have, it was always a struggle to reach a medium where we could actually move forward with policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I think the report lands in a pretty good space. It talks largely about how we can make it easier in relation to areas such as market testing. Right now in Australia, when a business needs to get a sheet metal worker, a diesel mechanic or another specialist in, they have to advertise in print, and the print advertisement in the local papers costs thousands and thousands of dollars. They have to do that for 28 days. It's quite ridiculous, when you can simply go onto seek.com and see that there are 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 vacancies for these positions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We spent a lot of the time understanding why these provisions are in place, where we have to prove what everybody in Australia already knows: there is an incredible shortage in certain sectors in the employment sphere. Right now if you go online and pull up chefs, you will see that there are around 5,000 vacancies in Australia. There are about 3½ thousand vacancies for restaurant managers. Yet, if anybody wants to bring an overseas worker in for either of those two areas, they have to advertise for a month in their local newspaper, at a cost of thousands and thousands of dollars. It's ridiculous. When we put that to the Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, they rejected the idea that they should have a better understanding of the various sectors right throughout regional Australia or in fact metropolitan Australia. We made recommendations in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the real understanding is that the pathways to permanency provisions that we have put in place will benefit Australia greatly. There is the realisation that the employment situation in so many different sectors is completely different in regional Australia to what it is in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. This goes to so many of the trades. Tradies can be expensive in Melbourne and Sydney, but at least you can get one. You put an advert in the paper or you go on seek.com and you fill that position relatively easily. In the regions, it's not like that, and this report highlights, through the evidence that we were able to receive, that disparity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again want to acknowledge the chair. I want to acknowledge the way that the Labor Party, even though they start from a long way away, have worked hard—Maria Vamvakinou, as the deputy chair, and Julian Hill—and come together to put the report in a way so that we can move forward and accept the report as a whole. I thank the committee for its work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill goes right to the core of the problem with this government. This government has a problem with transparency. It has a problem with rorting taxpayer funds. It has a problem every time the parliament says that there should be more transparency, as those opposite reject those efforts. And so it is the case when it comes to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Improved Grants Reporting) Bill 2021. This bill is the private senator's bill of my colleague Senator Gallagher. Right there in the title is all we're trying to achieve with this private senator's bill, with this bill before the House that should be considered immediately. All it does is require the government, where a minister has made an allocation of money that is contrary to departmental advice, to notify the finance minister within 30 days of that and for that to then be tabled in the parliament within five sitting days of that being received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an especially onerous ask for a government that isn't up to its neck in rorts. This is the most wasteful government in this country since Federation. It is a government that has a serial problem with serial rorting. We know why the government doesn't want a bar of this bill. We know why it wants to put it on the never-never. We know why it doesn't want it considered immediately. It's because the issues with this government—with rorting, with a lack of transparency—go all the way to the Prime Minister and his office. That's one of the key lessons we've learned from all the interrogation in the Senate—again, a credit to Senator Gallagher and the team over there in the Senate; a credit to the member for Ballarat when it comes to the car parks program, and a credit to the member for Scullin and others who have done their best to shine a light on the serial misuse of public money that we see on a regular basis when it comes to those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Ballarat said in question time today, when she was asking the Prime Minister to justify all of this rorting, particularly when it comes to car parks, this Prime Minister said five times in a 50-second span that the ministers make decisions about the allocation of this public money. If the ministers make those decisions, then surely the Australian people need, deserve and have a right to expect that those decisions are reported in a timely way. The reason this Prime Minister and this government don't want that to happen, whether it's in this House or in the Senate, is that they know the Prime Minister himself is up to his neck in these rorts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister was answering the member for Ballarat's question, he talked about a hunting licence. A hunting licence is a budget term for when an expenditure review committee delegates a decision to a minister. It's called a hunting licence for the minister to go away and make a decision and to justify that decision to the ERC. What we're really talking about here isn't a hunting licence; we're talking about a licence to rort. The current arrangements—encouraged, given succour by this Prime Minister—are a licence to rort. All we are trying to do here, with this legislation, with this bill, is to say that, when a minister makes a decision contrary to departmental advice, it is reported in a timely way so that the parliament can consider it—in the hope that a minister who is about to make a dodgy decision of the kind that so many of those opposite have made on such a regular basis would think twice about it if they knew it would be reported to the parliament. Those opposite don't want a bar of it because of the Prime Minister's own involvement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not talking here, unfortunately, about a nod and a wink or anything like that. We know from our questioning and from the forensic work of our colleagues here and in the other place that a lot of this work—the colour coded spreadsheets, the marginal seats, the shovelling of money in the direction of vulnerable sitting members—has been a climate, an arrangement, which has been fostered by the Prime Minister from the beginning. That's what we're discovering more and more about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has never seen a bucket of public money that it didn't want to rort. The list now is getting embarrassingly long for those opposite: sports rorts; dodgy land deals; the rorting of the Safer Communities Fund, if you can believe it; billions of dollars of JobKeeper money being sprayed around on already profitable companies that didn't need help, at the same time as the government was refusing to step in and help those small businesses that genuinely needed help. When you think about the most egregious revelations—in recent times, anyway—about the car park rorts, then you do see a pattern of behaviour here. The parliament needs to take steps to rein in this kind of rorting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lest the public think that this is a problem limited to one minister or another minister, that it's maybe now the education minister or maybe Minister Fletcher and not a widespread problem—I've already talked about the Prime Minister's own involvement—then think about the Treasurer. When the Treasurer was under pressure, or thought he was under pressure in his own seat at the last election—this has been uncovered in the last couple of months—he promised millions of dollars for a train station that shortly wouldn't exist. This is the kind of madness that has prevailed amongst those opposite as they clamber all over each other to try and rort these buckets of public money for their own base electoral and political benefit. That's why this bill is necessary, and that's why the second reading should be considered immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to be long in this place to hear the lectures, the rubbish in lecturing tones, from those opposite about the fiscal position, about the budget position. Those opposite printed the mugs that said they were back in black, despite the fact that they have delivered eight deficits now and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> says there are going to be 40 more, consecutively, and despite the fact that they multiplied the levels of debt so as to describe them as a 'debt and deficit disaster', when they were a mere fraction of current debt levels. We get all these lectures from those opposite about economic responsibility and budget responsibility at the same time as they're shovelling out money, spraying money all over the place in the least responsible manner in order to protect their own political prospects. With this kind of rorting and this kind of spending, it's no wonder this country is a trillion dollars in debt for the first time in his history. With this kind of wasteful spending, this kind of irresponsibility and this kind of rorting, no wonder this country doesn't have enough to show for the trillion dollars of debt that those opposite have racked up. So spare us the lectures about economic responsibility, when it seems like day after day after day we hear a new revelation about the wasteful rorting of taxpayer dollars for base political purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we want this considered now is that the time has long passed since this government, and future governments, deserved a dose of transparency to try and prevent the kind of situation that, under those opposite, we are seeing emerge with the encouragement of the Prime Minister. Whether it's sports rorts or land rorts or safer communities or JobKeeper or car parks, the pattern of behaviour that exists in this government puts at risk public faith in this place, public faith in politics and public faith in Australians' own democracy. That faith, that trust, is not exactly thick on the ground at the moment, as you might have noticed, Deputy Speaker Andrews. What we need to do in this place is work out what meaningful changes we can make to make sure that this spending is a little bit more transparent, that people have to justify decisions when they knock back departmental advice, so that ministers will think twice before taking the kinds of decisions that we have seen come to light in recent weeks and recent months—really, since the Prime Minister took office a couple of years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It says it all about this government that they don't want a bar of this bill. It says it all about this government that they are trying their best to protect their Prime Minister, their cabinet ministers and others from the kind of scrutiny that Australians have a right to expect and that Australians deserve. It's their money. Their money should be directed towards the right kinds of purposes in the national interest and not just in the political interest of a government which has become addicted to rorting taxpayer funds.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:50</span>):  I second the amendment. This is an important debate, and I think it is telling that the government is so unwilling to actually have a debate about the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Waiver of Debt and Act of Grace Payments) Bill 2019. It is telling because we know the reason the government doesn't want to debate this bill, doesn't want to see greater transparency in its decision-making and doesn't want an independent anticorruption commission, is that it is up to its neck in rorting. That is what we have seen over the course of the last eight years of this government, in particular, through the efforts of the Australian National Audit Office, an incredible, important institution in this country's democracy which the government has sought to reduce the funding for. What we've seen from the Australian National Audit Office is that there is a very significant problem that this government has with the way in which it uses taxpayer funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we are seeking to bring on for second reading debate here makes a minor change. It's not a massive change in terms of transparency, but it is an important one. The change it's seeking to make is that, where ministers make a decision to allocate funds to a project in their own electorate or they take a decision that is against the recommendation of their own department, within 30 days they report that to the Minister for Finance—they are actually required to report that now, but there's no time limit on when they need to do that—and the Minister for Finance then, within five sitting days, tables that report in the parliament. It's an important way of getting transparency, because it provides a bit of a handbrake on ministers to think. If you are going to make a decision like that, which benefits you personally in your own electorate, as we've seen in the cases of airport rorts, sports rorts, community safety rorts, regional rorts or car park rorts; if you are going to make a decision that goes counter to the recommendations of your own department; or if you are going to make a recommendation that significantly advantage you electorally then you need to be accountable to the parliament for that, because it can take months and months and months for those letters to the Minister for Finance to ever see the light of day. Sometimes it's literally years before they see the light of day. By shortening that time frame, it is saying to ministers: 'If you're going to make that decision, that's the decision you're going to make. But you need to tell the parliament that you have made that decision within that shorter time frame—within the month to five days in terms of the sitting period.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reasons we need to see these sorts of changes, the reasons we need an independent anticorruption commission and the reasons this bill itself is so important are the lengths this government has decided to go to in order to rort taxpayers' funds. We saw it in the portfolio I represent. It started with the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, basically a program, again, with no guidelines, millions of dollars of money going out the door, no process for application and no clear transparency about why decisions were being made. There were some questions the Audit Office started to ask about that program. We've all seen it in the Building Better Regions Fund, a program that the Audit Office is currently investigating and due to report in May next year. We've seen the way they've used that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to listen to the speakers on the other side of the chamber when it comes to budget time. They get up time after time and they say, 'I want to thank the minister for this project, this project and this project.' Have a listen to some of our people who can't say the same things, because they know that that money is constantly going into Liberal Party and National Party seats at the expense of Labor Party and other seats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then, of course, you look at the Urban Congestion Fund. This isn't just a small amount of money. Sports rorts was bad enough—the colour coded spreadsheets. A minister lost her job over it but now has been rehabilitated. You really have to question how on earth that's happened—seriously. We saw that with sports rorts, but what we've seen with the Urban Congestion Fund is that the government didn't learn from that. 'Okay, we've got a lesson here. We need to be more transparent, we need to be more careful about how we are making decisions, we need to be more equitable about how we make decisions across geographical areas in the country.' What they learned for the Urban Congestion Fund is 'let's not have any process at all'. There's no process at all. Blatantly, before an election campaign, they used this funding as a way in which to garner votes, particularly in seats that they were worried about or seats that they were targeting. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fund in particular, the Urban Congestion Fund, is $4.7 billion worth of funding. It's not the $200 million that we saw in sports rorts. It's not even the $250 million we see in the Building Better Regions Fund. It's a $4.7 billion program that the government have made 177 decisions under. Part of that program was the subject of the audit report—the car parks rorts. What we saw in that is that, despite the fact that Treasury officials were telling the government, 'You need to have a proper set of guidelines, you need eligibility criteria, you need to actually run a proper process for this,' the government ignored all of that advice and basically took a decision on 20 marginal seats. It canvassed those projects between the Prime Minister's office and Minister Tudge. It went out to Liberal Party candidates in the election campaign and asked them what car parks they wanted in their seats; went to patron senators, as the Liberal Party calls them, and asked them what projects they wanted in their seats; and targeted these 20 marginal seats. There were multiple emails between the Prime Minister's office and the minister, deciding on these projects. The department recommends a number and says, 'We haven't talked to all the states. We've talked to New South Wales; they've said there are a couple of car parks here. From what we've seen in the public domain about where urban congestion is, these are some areas where the fund might help.' The government ignores all of that and basically decides on these 20 marginal seats for the projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes to the heart of the Prime Minister's office's decision-making. It goes absolutely to the heart of the corruption that sits within this government. This is rorting on an industrial scale, and they will keep doing it unless we put measures in place such as those in this bill and we have an independent anticorruption commission—because what have they learnt in the course of the last eight years? They've learnt that this works. 'If we keep pork-barrelling and rorting into these seats, we might win some of them.' That's what they've learnt. The only way we can teach this government the lesson that this is not okay, that this is fundamentally undermining the democracy that we so care about, is to vote them out of office. But, until we can do that, putting in place measures such as this bill, sensibly moved by Senator Gallagher—and it should be debated and voted on in this place now—is the only opportunity we've got to say to this government, 'You need to do better and there needs to be greater transparency in your decision-making.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government had spent as much time getting the vaccine rollout right as it has rorting public money, we wouldn't be in the sort of mess we're in when it comes to getting out of COVID-19. There is a saying in public health and in the medical sphere—and, more broadly, about transparency—that the best disinfectant is sunlight. And that is what this bill tries to do. It tries to shine a light on the decision-making of ministers and make them accountable for the decisions that they're making, make sure that they're not seeking to hide decisions around recommendations that they're making and make sure that the parliament has an early opportunity to know about those decisions that are against departmental recommendations, in a way that hopefully puts a brake on some of the excesses that we have seen. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />We're not talking, as I said, about a small number of projects here or there; we are talking about billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Whether it's $30 million in the Leppington Triangle scandal, whether it's the $600 million in the car parks scandal, whether it's the $4.7 billion that I can bet your bottom dollar this government is going to rort again as it comes up into the next election or whether it's the millions of dollars of the community safety fund, this government is addicted to rorting public money, and we need to shine a light on it now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  In continuation, I mentioned earlier that we support these bills and the reasons why we support them, as well as the reservations that we have around the setting of most of the detail of these bills through regulation. I mentioned then that I would also continue, in my contribution today, to speak specifically about higher education and universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago—in fact, the Friday before the last parliamentary sitting—I attended the 30th anniversary of Edith Cowan University. I have three degrees from Edith Cowan University, and my brother gently reminded me that he also graduated from Edith Cowan University, so I must say that it is the Aly family university of choice. It is such a feat for the university to celebrate 30 years in the same year that we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Edith Cowan being elected to the parliament of Western Australia. As part of their celebrations, I attended a gala concert at the Perth Concert Hall that was put on by students of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts at Edith Cowan University. It was such an amazing event. It was a fantastic event. The closing piece of that evening was a spectacular performance put together by a WA Academy of Performing Arts student. The title of the piece was <span style="font-style:italic;">Transformation</span>. It reminded me of how my own life, as well as the lives of many of the young people I meet, has been transformed by education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate Edith Cowan University not just on that event but on reaching 30 years and really growing to the extent that they have. But juxtaposed against that wonderful celebration of 30 years was an announcement made just before that by the University of Western Australia that they were effectively cutting their social sciences offerings, meaning they would no longer be offering anthropology or sociology, among other social sciences, either as a degree or as a research area. The result of that will not just be felt in the 16 or so full-time jobs to be lost at that university. I was moved by the number of people who contacted me about this: academics, of course, especially those who come from the humanities; former graduates, of course, who understand the value of a humanities degree; students who were studying anthropology and sociology; and would-be students—young people who aspire to study a degree in the humanities and have a clear talent and passion for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to that, I wrote an opinion piece that was published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span>. In that opinion piece I drew attention to this government's eight-year-long undermining of universities and, in particular, the humanities. There has been absolute destruction of higher education—our universities as well as our TAFEs—and, specifically, ideological shadow boxing against the humanities. I was shocked when I found out that the former Minister for Education had taken it upon himself to veto ARC grants in the humanities, placing himself above a panel of discipline-specific experts—many of whom are professors, many of whom have done decades of research and earned international reputations in their own right—and placing himself above a college of experts, who deemed those grants worthy of funding, to veto those grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite seem to think that anthropologists and sociologists engage in navel-gazing activities where they clamour to write dissertations and study frivolous things like the migratory patterns of Argentinian ants or the relevance of the apostrophe in modern-day Tajikistan. That's not the case at all. Anthropologists and sociologists contribute so much. Their work is absolutely central, and has been central, to the management of pandemics. They played a vital role in the management of the Ebola virus outbreak. They understand human behaviour and human responses to pandemics, to government messaging and to policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me to not stand and speak on these bills that we support, because they make it easier, because they make education more accessible, specifically for our overseas students, and because they give some relief to those education providers. But we stand here and support these bills against a backdrop of a continuous eight-year attack on universities—one that has seen $3 billion in revenue lost. By the end of this year there will be $18 billion lost from our economy, from our education sector. Education has gone from being a $40 billion export to being a $22 billion export.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true that we have always been faced with harsh competition from like nations such as the UK, Canada and the US in attracting overseas students to study in Australia. For as long as I can remember, from my days of teaching ELICOS and attracting students to come to Australia to study English as a pathway to a university degree in Australia, we've grappled with these questions about how we make Australia a competitive nation for overseas students, and we have proven our place in the world landscape as a destination of choice for international students. We currently have 200,000 students stuck overseas with little or no hope of getting here and completing their degrees because we don't have proper, fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities that would enable that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice that many speakers who have contributed here have talked about universities pivoting to online learning. When I was teaching I always taught online as well as face to face, and I know that you cannot completely replace face-to-face learning with online delivery, particularly for some courses where students need to be in a lab. You also cannot deliver quality teaching without quality research; you simply cannot. If we want to grow and develop the minds of the future that will go on and contribute to the industries of the future, we need to make sure that our teaching at universities is up to date with industry trends and world trends. You simply cannot expect our world-class education system to remain world class if you cut research, if you undermine ARC grants or if you take away ARC grants that were justly assessed by a college of experts because you don't like the title of the grant and you have no understanding of the content of that particular research program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end on a point that was made by previous speakers. This point really demonstrates the government's contempt for higher education, particularly for universities. It's demonstrated not just in their undermining of the humanities. It's demonstrated not just in their ideological battle against the social sciences and the humanities. It's demonstrated not just in their cuts to universities. It's demonstrated not just in their failure to ensure quarantine facilities are there so that overseas students can return to universities and it can be back to business as usual. If there is anything that demonstrates the government's contempt for higher education and for universities it is the fact that they changed the rules for JobKeeper three times so universities could not get it. It is the fact that, since the pandemic began, they have presided over 18,000 job losses in one sector alone—and not in just any sector but in one of our largest export sectors, a sector in which Australia has enjoyed a very proud and strong international reputation. So, while we support these bills, we will continue to hold the government to account for their absolutely disgraceful undermining of the university sector.</span>

                    <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  [by video link] I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, because of the importance overseas students play not only in my electorate of Corangamite but also across our nation. Overseas students are so important to Deakin University and to my region as a whole. This bill does a number of things around cost-recovery, charges and the associated regulations for overseas students. Amongst other things, the bill updates the registration charges to recover costs for certain regulatory activities under the ESOS Act. The bill also establishes new registration charges consistent with the Australian Government Charging Framework. But there is a sad irony associated with this bill and its timing, because, on the one hand, the Morrison government wants to streamline the charging framework for overseas students attending Australian universities but, on the other hand, it makes it almost impossible for these overseas students to attend our universities. I will return to this point, but first I want to detail some context around overseas students in our region and the importance of Deakin University.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deakin University had over 13,000 overseas students. I said 'had' because, of course, this number of overseas students has been slashed. It's been decimated to virtually zero by COVID and the actions—or should I say inactions—of the Morrison government. In large part this has been due to the hopeless failure of the Morrison government to establish a robust quarantine system that would facilitate an early re-entry of overseas students. Overseas students are vital to my region's economy and to many regional economies, to our diverse cultural life and to getting the world's best and brightest people to stay in our region into the future. The education of overseas students is a major job creation engine in our region. This bill adds a whole lot of detail around the regulation and charging of overseas students, but what is the point of it if there are no overseas students? I ask all members to think about that question. The real tragedy is that all the job losses didn't have to happen. All these university job losses resulted from a deliberate decision by the Morrison government not to take responsibility for quarantine and not to support Australia's university sector overall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government, astoundingly, decided that the university sector would be excluded from JobKeeper but that the likes of Gerry Harvey, or Harvey Norman, would be included. How could any responsible government do that? How could they? I note recent figures from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office which show that 157,650 Australian employers who received JobKeeper support had turnover rise during that period compared to the same in 2019. In just three months these employers accrued $4.6 billion in taxpayer funded wage subsidies. If just half of that $4.6 billion had been supplied to the university sector, there would not have been job losses. This massive brain drain and the huge economic blow to Australia and our region would have been avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge Dr Alison Barnes from the NTEU, who said recently:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a small portion of the JobKeeper money that was wasted on corporate handouts to profitable companies, we could have saved the 21,000 jobs lost from higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes indeed. I want that figure on the parliamentary record: 21,000 jobs lost in the Australian university sector because of some weird agenda by the Morrison government to punish universities—21,000 Australian jobs lost. And that is not the end of it; it continues. Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, has said that the sector is estimated to lose a further 5.5 per cent, or $2 billion, in 2021 alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is not where punishment of the Australia university sector by the Morrison government ends. There's even more—a lot more. Everyone in this chamber would remember the tortuous path of the higher education support amendment bill. The bill cut another billion dollars in Australian government expenditure to Australian universities. And of course it hugely punished Australian students interested in pursuing careers in the arts and humanities, doubling already-high fees and saddling our youth with even higher levels of debt. Overall, that piece of legislation increased already-high costs to students by seven per cent. Forty per cent of students had to cop increased fees, some by as much as 113 per cent. Arts and business students will now leave university with debts averaging between $40,000 and $50,000 for a normal degree. What a disgraceful attack on students because they wish to pursue a career in humanities. The respected academic and university policy analyst Andrew Norton put it very simply:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">A future education minister is going to have to fix these problems</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian university sector is bleeding profusely, and Deakin University is no exception. This is largely due to the Liberal government's funding cutbacks, the absence of overseas students and the refusal of the Morrison government to provide support to the sector when they desperately need it. JobKeeper was the sad example of this. The Morrison government has been consistently rigid in its refusal to allow universities to access JobKeeper, and it makes no sense. We are proud of the quality education our universities provide; they are the engine room of regional employment and an important economic driver. Instead, under the Morrison government we see universities hurting and shedding jobs. For Deakin University, this has resulted in more than 300 jobs lost. At the time, I spoke out about these job losses in the local media. These job losses have devastated morale for many at Deakin University and have left many local families facing difficult times during this pandemic. Casualisation of the university workforce makes it even harder to keep your job, because those who aren't tenured are the first to lose their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is sad that casualisation of the workforce under the Morrison government has escalated to alarming proportions—it is really staggering. I do want to give a shout-out to all the employees at Deakin University. You are doing an amazing job in these very challenging times. What you need is a federal government that cares about you and cares about our education system, our university sector. While this bill deals with a lot of the detail about the regulation of overseas students, there are virtually no overseas students to apply this bill to. To me, it feels exactly like fiddling while Rome is burning. I will leave you with that thought. We on the Labor side will support this bill, but we do not support the attack on the university sector. We are alarmed by it. We will fight it. When we come into government, we will fix it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the struggling university sector is just another pointer to the Morrison government's fundamental failures. A pointer to one of their fundamental failures is the two tasks they had during this COVID crisis. The first is the failure to effectively roll out vaccines. The second is the Morrison government's failure to establish a high-quality quarantine system. That's what we need to get the university sector back on its feet, that's what we need to get overseas students back into our universities, and that's what we need to help our regional economies to get moving again. This is what the Prime Minister should be focused on. Instead, the Morrison government is totally failing Deakin University and the whole Australian university sector. This is not vision. It's not leadership. Universities need a government that believes in their vitality and the significant role they and our TAFE sector play in equipping us all for the future. Only a change of government will deliver such an outcome. It is certainly time for that change.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 is part of a set of cognate bills and other so-called reforms to impose a cost recovery model on the sector. As has been said in previous debates and again in this debate, this is the very worst possible time you could pick to shift a sector to cost recovery. In the previous debate, on the related TEQSA bill, even government speakers acknowledged that providers are paying about 15 per cent of the costs. At the very time that students are not able to come to Australia and university revenues are being smashed, the government wants to move the sector to 100 per cent cost recovery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill—no doubt the government will try to tell us this bill is a great thing—throws a tiny, tiny crumb to the international education sector by fiddling around with the charges, which should give them the princely saving of about $7 million a year. That sounds nice, doesn't it? But, firstly, the impact is largely irrelevant given the scale of damage to the sector; it's lost literally billions of dollars of revenue. Secondly, the impact is actually unknown. Peak irony: the government, in this bill, is giving $7 million of fee relief through the CRICOS registration charges and yet, in the other bill, is increasing charges for full cost recovery by a much larger and indeed unknown amount. So I don't know how any provider or university, private or public, could bank this saving without having a clue what's coming down the pipeline in the TEQSA changes. It's truly ridiculous. The sector has unprecedented financial challenges. The government is giving on one hand and taking more with the other. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">International education was—I say 'was', sadly, in the past sense—Australia's fourth biggest export sector, worth over $40 billion to our economy. More than that, international education has enriched our cities and regions; it's made our campuses more vibrant and diverse. It's been an incredible national success story, something we as a country should be so proud of—that hundreds of thousands of young people, at that time in their life, have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases, to come and study and live in our community. It's increased our soft power, over decades, incalculably.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID has decimated this sector—our fourth-largest export sector, decimated by COVID. Some damage, of course, was unavoidable, with the borders shut. This is a sector—one of the service sectors—that relies on the movement of human beings and was always going to suffer damage. But the scale of the damage has been exacerbated and made far worse by deliberate actions and neglect by this government. As I said, the sector was worth $40.3 billion before COVID. The latest ABS stats saw that fall last year to $31.7 billion—a loss of 25 per cent of the value of this sector. The latest Mitchell Institute modelling projects another $10 billion loss in 2022; so we'll be down to half of where we were, and that will keep going. It will possibly actually start falling exponentially, for reasons I'll touch on. This is a devastating impact. This is billions of dollars of lost revenue for our universities and TAFEs and also an existential crisis for our independent providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember—and I say this to bust an urban myth—that international students do not take our domestic student places, as too many Australians think and indeed some government members seem to imply or think. They create places and opportunity for Australian students. They fund our classrooms, our capital works programs at campuses and indeed a significant share of our research effort. To be really clear, the impacts of this devastation that has been wrought on this sector include research. As a member for Cowan so eloquently spoke about, billions of dollars cut from international education means billions of dollars lost for our research effort. In an environment of the first recession in 30 years, when we should be thinking about economic recovery, that's the very time we need to be investing more in research and innovation, not less, and yet research funding is falling. The government's cutting research funding this year. This will also, over time, impact our ranking, because our global rankings for universities, which in turn help drive our attractiveness as a student destination, are significantly driven by research. So we're going to see a very nasty cycle emerge over the next two to three years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen thousands of jobs lost at universities, with the government doing nothing. The latest estimate of jobs lost directly is between 18,000 and 21,000—and they're just the jobs that show up in the org charts in the universities. Untold thousands more casual teachers, sessional teachers, casual researchers, administrative staff, cleaning staff and so on have been lost. The ABS estimates this year say that 30,000 fewer people are working in higher education than were working the year before. These are avoidable losses. The government changed the JobKeeper rules three times to stop universities being eligible for JobKeeper. They didn't just stand by passively; they actively made sure that these jobs would be lost by refusing to extend the support to the sector. The economic impact has been felt on jobs in the cities and in the regions. I think the ABS stats said, before the crash, over 240,000 jobs were supported by international education in Australia. That's actually more jobs than are created in the entire mining sector. It's more jobs than are created and supported in the entire agricultural sector. The government has nothing to say on this. They're just happy to stand by while tens of thousands of jobs are lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also impacting our reputation. This is where the government is culpable. The Prime Minister actually stood up last year publicly and told students, 'If you don't like it, go home.' How do you think that resonated in a market where word of mouth is everything? Can anyone imagine the Prime Minister saying that about another one of our big export sectors? 'If you don't like our iron ore, don't buy it. If you don't like our agricultural produce, then nick off. Buy someone else's.' Why on earth would the Prime Minister say that about this sector? He's got a pattern of hostility. Remember, he blamed them the year before for congestion. It wasn't his failure to invest in infrastructure or rorting every infrastructure dollar he could find to push to marginal seats that was causing congestion; apparently, it was international students trying to get a bus to the university. Pathetic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do call on the government to extend the 485 visas. One positive thing which they could do right now would be for those thousands of students who are stuck offshore with a valid 485 postgraduate study visa. They were made a promise by this country, they invested thousands of dollars and years of their life to study here, they happened to be home when the borders were shut, and they're unable to come back and use that visa. That was a promise our country made them. We can't bring them back right now, because of the government's failures on quarantine, but we could at least do the decent thing—the smallest thing—and say, 'When the borders reopen, we will honour the promise as a country we made you and we will let you come back and have your one year or two years of post-study work rights.' That's in our national interest as well, because they form such a wonderful part of our pipeline of highly skilled migrants, in regional areas as well as in cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final thing I'd note is the human impact on students is incalculable. As I said, they've invested a lot. For some students it's a case of, 'We enrolled, we're studying online and we'll be able to come at some point.' That's not a positive thing, a positive experience. But for some of these students, the government has to talk to them and at least say, 'We will prioritise you as soon as we can bring back any students.' Take a student who's invested hundreds of thousands of dollars doing a dental course. They've had five years in Australia, and they're stuck offshore unable to do their sixth year. They've gone into debt, and they see their life dreams evaporate. The government has had nothing to say to those students who've invested so much in our community. It's not a matter of trading them off against stranded Australians, which the government tries to do every time you raise this, but just being decent and human and understanding that these are people. They're human beings, they're young people who've invested in our country. We could at least have something to say to them: that we understand the sacrifice that they're making, that we understand the difficulties that it's causing. We understand that some have partners living in Australia. I've tried to help some students whose partners are living in my electorate. They are not able to come back and have never met their own child. Their own child has been born, they've only met their child on WhatsApp, and the government has nothing to say to these people. We can do better than this as a country and we can do better by our fourth-biggest export sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I'd make about the impacts is that without action business failures are looming. The university situation is bad enough—the impact on research, capital works and so on—but the situation facing independent providers is existentially grim. This is a sector that works on pipelines, let's be clear. As current students leave, if there are no students coming through the borders to replace them, the student cohort shrinks. In the short term last year there was relatively little pain. Providers could adjust to some ups and downs and they still had a good stock of students who were in the country. But there's no JobKeeper eligibility for most of these providers because they couldn't show the drop in turnover at the critical time when JobKeeper was around, so they didn't get support at that point because they didn't need it. But for this sector, unlike most other sectors, the fiscal cliff is looming because their stock in the pipeline, if you like, the students coming in, has dried up. If you sit down and talk to them—the government doesn't talk to them—they'll tell you they can look down the pipeline and the next six months are going to be hard and they will hurt. A lot of providers that could with their balance sheets have stuck away a bit of money to try to get through to Christmas. That's when the government suggests that students will start to come back. But by the time we get to January or July next year, we'll be at serious risk of significant business failure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no exaggeration to say that for independent providers—not dodgy providers; most of them will go out of business because they don't have reserves, and good riddance to the small number that are dodgy—reputable businesses that have run a quality product and have been in the market for decades are facing a valley of death that is looming over their business. The government won't say it, but it seems unlikely that students are going to return before mid-next year at least. Oh, what could have been: if the government had invested in purpose-built quarantine facilities, hadn't turned its back on the sector last year and rejected every plea for help and every creative idea, we could have had thousands more students at least onshore and we could have had 38,000 stranded Australians back onshore. But the government decided it was fun to play politics and blame the states for everything, instead of taking responsibility and putting in place a safe national quarantine system. We are where we are, but they've wasted our island continent advantages and they've set up this impossible conflict between students and stranded Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course people understand that citizens are going to get priority, but we should not be in this situation where we've seen the scale of devastation in our fourth-biggest export sector. So we're going to need—and I call on the government to do this—to provide more business assistance and to sit down to talk with the sector. If the government know that they're not going to be bringing students back for 12 months—if that's what the government are prepared to say and actually prepared to state as a view—then they have to give some comfort by working with the sector and businesses now. This is a sector that knows exactly what's going to happen. You tell them where the student pipeline's going to be, they will tell you at what point their businesses will fail and we'll see more closures and more loss of jobs. The government says it's put in $53 million. It's not nearly enough and it's not targeted. A lot of that went to universities; that's a different problem. Some of it went to ELICOS, English language teaching, and quite rightly so, but the VET and higher-ed providers need help and they need engagement now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we need is a plan to rebuild the sector from the ground up. I hate to say this, but there's no choice but to hope that the minister for education will champion it. That was the minister who gave us robodebt, the minister for car park rorts, the minister who made a mess of immigration. And so, for that brilliance, they promoted him to education. But unfortunately it's this man, the minister for education, on whose competence and ability to get something through cabinet the future of our fourth biggest export sector rests. God help them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't rely on the Prime Minister. He weirdly hates international education. As I said, he told the students to go home, blamed them for his own failures on infrastructure and congestion, gave no help or care—verging on sociopathic kind of lack of empathy, time after time. He wouldn't treat any other sector like that. The lobsters even got their own plane, but there is not a word of care or concern for international students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for education has a strategy. I understand he got it a couple of weeks ago. It's a bit constipated in the department. The department of education's not going that well. They've had three or four people in charge of this strategy. Apparently the international education person is acting up in a job. But, anyway, the minister's finally got a strategy, with a road map to recovery. I urge him to get it out and give some hope to the sector. Hope is not a strategy, but it's a good start. At least he can say what his plan for recovery is and then try as best he possibly can not to do a robodebt, not to do a car park rort, not to make the mess like he did in immigration. He can try to get something through cabinet to actually repair some of the damage in our fourth biggest export sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've outlined a few positive ideas. The government are going to need to help the independent education providers. They're going to need to send some messages to the students and start to repair the market and reputational damage and show that we do care as a country. They're going to have to start putting some money into marketing and get a bit more focus across the bureaucracy. Time doesn't permit me to go through all the solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to seeing the strategy and I hope it's a good one. I used to look after international ed in the Victorian public service and worked under Labor governments and Liberal governments. I travelled with Liberal premiers and Liberal ministers to China. This should be a bipartisan portfolio. It should be a bipartisan sector. I've never before seen this lack of care for this sector from a Liberal government, ever. It's time it stopped. This sector has been a wonderful thing for our country and it deserves more attention from the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  [by video link] It's always a hard act to follow the member for Bruce, and I commend him on his strong speech on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and the related bills. Like so many parts of Australian society, we are feeling the effect of last year's negligence and last year's inaction by the Morrison government. It is nowhere more stark than in our university sector, where, last year, not only did they exacerbate the problems that our university sector is facing by not building purpose-built quarantine facilities, but also they've systematically attacked our educators and made university more expensive for Australians to go to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Labor Party have always championed our university sector. From the Whitlam reforms, many of my parents' generation went to university for free. Within a generation, the life and the living standards of Australians, including our family, were turned around. Because of the Labor Party's longstanding commitment to access to education, it is through university, it is through higher education, that Australians have had the social mobility to be able to do whatever they want within this country. But that dream is slowly being chopped away at and undermined by the efforts of this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, due to this pandemic, we have seen our university sector on its knees. For too long, the university sector has been underfunded by this government and by successive Liberal governments. Instead of being funded properly, the university sector has been forced to rely on international students to make up a lot of the revenue that the government and successive Liberal governments have cut from courses. So the university sector has a financial model where it absolutely relies on international education. Because of this pandemic the sector has had a huge reduction in revenue to subsidise and support Australian students and quality Australian education through having a reduction in the number of international students coming here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that, for Australia's fourth-largest export industry—it is Victoria's single largest service exporter—the federal government would be doing absolutely everything in its power to help ensure that our universities are supported throughout this pandemic. You would think that it would do everything in its power to ensure the key revenue of international education coming into this country. It not only supports our university sector but supports businesses and accommodation and is a huge benefit for our economy. You would think that the federal government would be doing everything in its power to help ensure that our university sector could survive. But it's not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has consistently been attacking our university sector. It has been undermining our university sector. You need to look only as far as the JobKeeper reform to see how much the university sector in Australia was never a priority for the Morrison government. You couldn't have designed JobKeeper in a way that excluded universities more directly than the way in which this government designed JobKeeper. To create a JobKeeper program that specifically excluded the university sector was literally a design of the Morrison government. Despite the urging and the amendments put forward by Labor, it was the federal government that flat out refused to support the university sector through JobKeeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw were massive job losses across the sector. Monash University proudly has one of its campuses in my electorate of Macnamara. It also produces some of the finest people in this country. The great Monash University lost over 250 jobs. A total of 277 jobs were lost in 2020, mainly because the federal government flat out refused to support our university sector with JobKeeper. We saw comparable job losses at the major Victorian universities of Deakin and La Trobe. Universities have been left behind by the federal government. It's so frustrating. Universities have gone through the really traumatic experience of this pandemic. Not having the extra revenue from international students has been compounded by the fact that they were left behind in regard to the JobKeeper scheme. Then you add to that the fact of the legacy reforms of the Morrison government, which are to make university more expensive for a lot more Australian students, especially those in humanities courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a humanities student. I proudly studied politics and history. Yet the consecutive attacks on our humanities courses, on creative thinking, on critical thinking, on independent thought, on history, on our society and on ethics have been pretty disappointing to say the least. It has been a reflection of the values of the Morrison government that they have constantly sought to undermine free and independent thinking if it doesn't comply with the government's thinking. Successively we've seen JobKeeper, the cuts and the lack of purpose-built quarantine put our university sector on its knees. We've then seen the federal government make universities more expensive for more students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this moment to reflect on the fact that, throughout this pandemic, our young Australians have missed out on so many milestones. Each and every day away from school and away from your friends is really difficult. Our young Australians have been asked to do so much throughout this pandemic. It's important to note every single time a young Australian misses a formal, every single time a young Australian misses a sporting event, every single time a young Australian misses a chance to go and hang out at their friend's house, every single time a young Australian doesn't get to leave school and hang out on campus and experience all of the joys of campus life after doing a tough year 12. It's important to recognise that young Australians have had to go through their best years, their formative years, the years when they could have grown and experienced independence and all of the joys of the world and of Australian society—travel, exploration and all the things that we all have fond memories of—having missed those milestones because of this pandemic. And what are they confronted with? They're confronted with a government that tells them that university is going to be more expensive for them, they're confronted with a government that tries to prescribe which courses they engage in, they're confronted with a government that clearly hasn't prioritised the university sector or prioritised the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be investing in our young people, because our young people are missing out on so much. Of course they've been left behind in the vaccine rollout. Our young people have been really forced to bear the brunt of this pandemic and have not had an opportunity to get vaccinated until very recently, and all the mixed messaging has been extremely confusing for young people. We should acknowledge it. But I also think that we really should acknowledge the fact that each milestone missed by a young Australian is important. It's something that we should be thankful of and thankful for, that younger Australians, with dignity, have managed to do that, making huge sacrifices for the betterment of Australian society. So the least that we could be doing, the least that the Australian government could be doing is saying to them, 'Thank you,' and investing back in their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the way in which the federal government has treated our university sector does the exact opposite. It says that we're going to make your university more expensive, we're going to leave you with more debt, we're not going to support the university sector in the way in which we could and we're not going to try as hard as we can to ensure the future prosperity of, and investment into, our university sector. And it's really disappointing, because that is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing at this time. Now is the time to be investing in young people, now is the time to be saying to young people that there is hope, you will get through this and we're going to invest in the opportunities that you're going to need in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would take this opportunity to say directly to the younger people of Australia: We appreciate all of the sacrifices you've made. Every milestone that you've missed is important. And whether it was a school formal, a sporting match, just a chance to hang out with your friends, a chance to hang out on campus life, a chance to just be a young Australian and to be yourself, the fact that you've missed out on that and made sacrifices is amazing, and it's important. It's helped keep people safe. The end of this pandemic is going to come, and you will have a return to some form of normal life. It will happen. Have faith, it will happen. In the meantime, in order to reward younger Australians, we should be saying to you that our university sector should be the best funded in the world, that our university sector will not be the source of constant cuts and undermining, that if we work to create a wage subsidy program our university sector shouldn't be missing out on that—they should be at the top of our funding pile—and that we recognise all of your sacrifices and we want to help invest in the future so that you can give back to this wonderful country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I say that we have seen a really disappointing few years for our university sector by the Morrison government, but it is true to form. We would hope that with a change of government it will give us the opportunity to right the wrongs, reinvest back in our university sector, reinvest back in our young Australians and reinvest back into the future, as a Labor government has always done and will do long into the future. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Children and Families and Assistant Minister for Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  I thank all members for their contributions to this debate in relation to the Education Services for Overseas Students legislation package. This package of four bills will give effect to the government's decision in the 2021-22 budget to implement updated cost recovery arrangements for registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS, from 1 January 2022.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 will allow the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to recover the cost of the efficient regulatory services it provides to the international education sector, including in its role as the regulator of schools that enrol international students. The new arrangements will result in a reduction in the department's CRICOS charges. The amendments are necessary to ensure the charging approach meets the requirements for the Australian government Charging Framework and to maintain the quality and reputation of our Australia's international education sector, positioning it for recovery and regrowth. Consequential amendments to the three other acts facilitate the changes set out in the registration charges bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I table an addendum to the EM. I thank members for your engagement on the bills and your continued commitment to the international education sector and I commend these bills to the House. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Moreton has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. So the immediate question is that the amendment be disagreed to. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. This is legislation that would amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to extend the free rate of customs duty to certain medical and hygiene products from 31 December 2022 until 30 June this year; provide for free rate of customs duties for goods for use in the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program; and for prescribed motor vehicles and motor vehicle components for research and development activities by automotive service providers previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that Labor supports, because the amendments will facilitate continued access to medical products and hygiene products for use in combatting COVID-19. There is, of course, an ongoing need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the Australian community, and the products that we are talking about here will include face masks, gloves, clothes or gowns, goggles, glasses, eye visors, face shields, soaps, COVID-19 test kits and reagents, viral transport media and disinfectants. Also, the amendments contained in this bill will support continued domestic research and development in the automotive sector, and ensure that previously registered automotive service providers can continue to access the tariff concession. This will help automotive service providers maintain an Australian presence, including through the engineering services design and product development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains three significant measures, as I touched on earlier. The first is to incorporate the Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2021, which was tabled in the parliament on 3 February. As has been made clear in the explanatory memorandum to the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The provision of a "Free" rate of customs duty for certain medical and hygiene products to 30 June 2021 is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $3.8 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure will also insert new items to provide a free rate of customs duty for goods that are for use in the program known as the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program. Under the memorandum of understanding for the development of the joint strike fighter, Australia has committed to achieving tax neutrality under the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program. This measure incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2021, which was tabled in the parliament on 17 March. The implementation for a free rate for goods associated with this will reduce receipts by $6.7 million across the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the third measure would insert a new item, section 39A, into schedule 4 to provide a free rate of customs duty for prescribed motor vehicles and motor vehicle components for research and development activities by automotive service providers previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme and where the time for working out duty is between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2025. This measure incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 3) 2021, tabled in May this year. The implementation of this free rate of customs is estimated to reduce receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures commenced respectively on 1 January, 1 March and 1 April 2021 through notices of intention to propose customs tariff alterations and related customs tariff proposals, necessitating the amendment to the bill we're dealing with now. We must ensure Australia's domestic manufacturing capacity and capability through this prolonged COVID crisis and we must also support our long-term recovery. We must support industries that are of strategic importance. Therefore I move the following second reading amendment to this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(3) further notes that the Prime Minister's refusal to secure a variety of vaccines in accordance with world's best practice has left Australians dangerously exposed against highly infectious COVID-19 variants".</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we will never forget, in the context of this legislation, that it was this coalition government that oversaw the destruction of our car industry.

As a result of this action and others, the coalition has presided over the permanent loss of more than 55,000 manufacturing jobs in Australia.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Perhaps you were aware of this matter when you were sitting around another table. The Morrison government has had more than a year to invest in new manufacturing capability and they haven't, once again leaving Australia missing out on new jobs and manufacturing opportunities. Government experts have since confirmed that the Prime Minister has never had a plan to create manufacturing jobs, just plans to create headlines. The secretary of the department confirmed at the 2021-22 budget estimates that the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy has not created a single job—not a single job!—saying that this fact is crystal clear and an inevitable outcome of the funding profile that no new jobs in manufacturing have been created under the strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we need to be a country that makes things, but this government has squandered this opportunity and has left companies that have supported the national effort in the lurch. There is one example which is particularly telling: an Australian company that supported our domestic production of medical masks at a time of greatest need, Med-Con. When the pandemic hit at the start of last year, as borders were closing and the immediate imports of some critical medical equipment were frozen, Australian health services needed masks immediately and Med-Con was the only surgical mask manufacturer in the country. It's a small, family owned business based in Shepparton in Victoria and it was critical to supplying our frontline health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government begged Med-Con to boost its supply and they did their bit—as all Australians have done throughout the pandemic. But they have been let down by this Prime Minister and left in the lurch. In April 2020 the Prime Minister, on his Facebook page, spoke of supporting Med-Con. He spoke at great length about this. But if we fast forward to 21 July of this year, this is what the CEO of Med-Con, Steven Csiszar, said to the ABC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All the people we've supported throughout the pandemic seem to have left us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cameras move on and so does this Prime Minister, which is just so revealing of his behaviour at every turn. He is all about the photo op and never there for the follow-through. Whether it's bushfires or the pandemic, he cannot move himself beyond base politics and beyond engaging with daily political tactics. He has proven himself incapable of governing for all Australians or for the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that the Prime Minister had two jobs this year: speedy, effective rollout of the vaccine and putting in place dedicated national quarantine arrangements. He has failed at both to the cost of all us. The economy is bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars every day and billions a week because he hasn't done these two jobs. Australians can't afford another three years of this kind of leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the provisions that are contained in the bill, which are of themselves uncontentious, but we must be on guard with what is happening with our broader policy settings. We can't afford to be caught off guard like this again. The pandemic has underlined how exposed we are to disruptions in global supply chains. The pandemic has taught us we need to be a country that makes things, and a state-of-the-art sovereign vaccine capability must be top of this list. Under Labor, Australia and Australians won't be left behind as we have been under this government. Labour has a plan for reconstruction that will rebuild our manufacturing base, create good jobs and safeguard our health and prosperity. It's all about creating the advanced manufacturing industries that will power good jobs and a stronger economy and provide ongoing sovereign capability for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is not on the side of Australian manufacturing and he does not believe in a future made in Australia—and, even if he did, he does not have the character, vision or competence to see it through.</span>

                    <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I rise today to speak about some important amendments to the Customs Tariff Act through the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. The changes we are proposing incorporate three proposals that have been tabled in parliament this year which provide for a free rate of customs duty for a range of imported goods. The measures contained in these proposals will continue to support the availability of vital health and hygiene products in the community, contribute to our ability to fulfil international defence commitments and facilitate continued research and development in the automotive sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Customs tariff proposal No.1 will extend the free rate of customs duty for imported prescribed medical and hygiene products that can be used to combat COVID-19. The coronavirus continues to spread around the world at an alarming rate. While our record on suppressing the virus here in Australia has been world leading, recent and ongoing lockdowns make it clear that we are not out of the woods yet. In fact, the delta variant of the virus has proved to be the most contagious and is responsible for our current state of lockdowns and community restrictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest data on COVID-19, at the time this speech was written, reveal there have been 280 locally acquired cases in the past 24 hours. There are currently 4,727 active cases and 433 people are in hospital. But Australia is rising to the challenge. There have been 168,120 COVID tests done in the past 24 hours. In my home state of Queensland there are currently 144 active cases. We have just come out of a five-day lockdown and many restrictions remain in place. Meanwhile, Australia's vaccine rollout is gaining pace. As of Saturday, there have been more than 13½ million doses delivered. The Australian government remains committed to protecting the health of all Australians and we are doing our part, along with the state governments, to suppress the virus as best we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the tools we have is to make it easier to import medical and hygiene products that will help us fight this terrible pandemic. The first amendment to the Customs Tariff Act is an extension of a temporary free rate of customs duty for a selection of imported prescribed medical and hygiene products to combat COVID-19. Specific goods covered by the measure include facemasks, gloves, clothes or gowns; goggles, glasses, eye visors or face shields; disinfectant preparations classified to heading 3808 in schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act, excluding hand sanitisers; soaps; and COVID-19 test kits, reagents and viral transport media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposal contains a measure that extends the free rate of customs duty for these eligible goods from 31 December 2022 to 30 June 2021. This tariff concession initially started on 1 February 20. Through consultation with stakeholders, including Australian businesses, the measure has been extended twice to continue to meet the needs of the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end date was previously extended from 31 July 2020 to 31 December 2020. This latest extension of the measure to 30 June 2021 is expected to reduce receipts by $3.8 million across the forward estimates. This extension to the free rate will ensure individuals and businesses continue to have access to the essential supplies required to keep themselves and other members of the community safe. It will also help ensure that Australia remains a competitive market for these essential medical and hygiene goods and allow the community to source these goods for those people who need it most, such as healthcare professionals and other essential workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment to the Customs Tariff Act that we are debating here today provides a free rate of customs duty from imported goods that were used in the F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program. This program is a plan for affordable next-generation strike aircraft weapon systems for our armed forces and our allies. The Australian government has already acquired around 30 of the Lockheed Martin designed Lightning II aircraft. We will eventually acquire 72 Joint Strike Fighters in total, along with associated weapons, spares, support equipment and infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The F-35A brings cutting-edge technologies to the battle space of the future and is critical to achieving the objectives set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Defence strategic update</span> to shape, deter and respond. Our fleet of F-35As will fulfil the functions of air dominance and strike capability currently provided by F/A-18A/B Hornets. The F-35A Lightning II, in concert with the Super Hornet and Growler aircraft, will be a potent air combat capability mix. This will provide the Royal Australian Air Force with crucial air combat power to meet Australia's needs beyond 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is acquiring F-35A as part of an international cooperative program led by the United States. Under the agreement, partners bid for and win work on the global program on a best-value basis. Australia has won over $2.7 billion worth of work, with more than 50 companies involved. In time, this will expand to include maintenance and repair for a range of system components in support of the global fleet. Australia will continue to work with the United States and our industry partners as more aircraft are delivered through to 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment to the Customs Tariff Act supports Australia's participation in the Joint Strike Fighter production, sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding. This memorandum was signed in 2006 and commits to achieving tax neutrality. This measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $6.7 million over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the third amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that we are debating here today incorporates a measure to provide a free rate of customs duty for certain imported motor vehicles and motor vehicle components. These vehicles and components must have been imported by an automotive service provider previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme. While registrations under the scheme have closed, the time for working out duty runs to 30 June 2025. These goods included under the amendment measure must be imported for use in the testing, quality control and manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia. This measure extends to the treatment previously provided to these goods during the operation of the Automotive Transformation Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme supports the Australian automotive industry and aims to encourage competitive investment, innovation and economic sustainability through financial assistance. Under the scheme, motor vehicle producers were covered for up to 15 per cent of the cost of eligible plant and equipment and 50 per cent of eligible research and development investments. With the end of the second stage of this scheme, this concessional item ensures that companies previously registered under the scheme can continue to access a customs duty concession and are not subject to additional regulatory burden. This measure is about supporting the automotive manufacturing industry, facilitating continued research and development in the automotive sector and supporting local jobs. It responds to concerns from the automotive industry that the end of the concession would significantly disrupt research and development activities. The measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that we are debating here today are vital to Australia's continued health and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our national security. The world in which we live is always changing, and we as a government need to change with it and support those vital industries that keep us safe and support our economy. One of the ways in which we can do this is by amending our existing customs tariff legislation to reduce import duties on goods that are so important to our future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282984" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONNELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  The current times have really forced us to assess where our priorities lie, as we rightly should periodically, and make adjustments where we need to. One of those areas has been in personal protective equipment, or PPE. We're all rolling with face masks at the moment in many places around the country and, indeed, the world. Along with face masks, gloves, gowns and the like are significantly high-volume disposables. So we have had to make some legislative amendments in order to give favour to the flexibility with which we can import PPE. The second priority I will touch on today as I speak to this bill is that of defence industry. I see the shadow assistant minister for defence, the member for Paterson, is in the chamber, and I know that she is incredibly passionate about defence industry, particularly the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as are we all. Supporting defence industry absolutely is another priority which as a nation we are absolutely getting behind. The third priority I'd like to touch on is lower carbon transport. There is an awful lot of innovation going into lower-carbon transport options. These include dual-cell vehicles, which have a traditional hydrocarbon power source mixed with electric, and electric vehicles. Some of the emerging research is going into the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transport. I highlight these three priority areas because they are captured in the intent behind this bill. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021, is set to amend the Customs Tariff Act by paying particular attention to three proposals around these three priorities, which have already been tabled in parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the first proposal contains a measure that has the effect of extending the free rate of customs duty for eligible medical and hygiene products which are capable of use as we combat COVID-19. This extends that eligibility from 30 June 2021. This tariff concession commenced last February. The Morrison government, through consultation with a range of Aussie businesses, recognised the importance of this measure, and so has extended it twice already. With infections still current in at least three states at the moment, it's more vital than ever that we continue to meet the needs of our community through the pandemic. We cannot step on or even contemplate applying the brakes any time soon. Indeed, we are powering ahead with the delivery of the vaccine so that we can suppress the virus. So far, and I congratulate Australians on their wonderful acceleration in the take-up of vaccines, 13.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. This takes our rate of fully vaccinated people to over 22 per cent and rising. Our rate of vaccination is well over one million doses per week. This weekend we hit another significant milestone when we saw 140,225, to be precise, people roll up their sleeves, marking a record rate for a Saturday. This government is overcoming hurdles that are thrown at us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much as all of us, I'm sure, would like to possess a crystal ball, nobody does. There have been changes in our plan throughout the pandemic as the situation has changed, even as the virus itself has changed. German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke commented, 'No operational plan survives first contact with enemy forces.' A learning that all young military offices, at least in Australia, are reminded of is that once you confront the enemy things are absolutely, guaranteed, going to change. That's what we've seen through this pandemic, and we will keep amending our plan as need be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we can celebrate a great deal of success. I look around OECD nations, for example, and if we were to experience the same rate of deaths from COVID on a per-head of population basis, we would have experienced 30,000 deaths. Whilst every single death that we have unfortunately experienced in Australia is an absolute tragedy, it is certainly a fortunate circumstance indeed that we have avoided tens of thousands more deaths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over three million Australians have also been supported through JobKeeper, and one million Australians are now back at work. This absolutely fits within the government's consistent mantra of focusing on saving lives and livelihoods. It is particularly pleasing that Lieutenant General Frewen has been appointed to oversee the vaccine rollout. I can attest to General Frewen's capabilities, having served as one of the officers under his command during my time as a military officer. He was a fantastic commanding officer and a wonderful commander of the joint task force in the complex environment of the Solomon Islands. He certainly has some great runs on the board. So it's wonderful to see him as part of the team fighting COVID here on our shores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're witnessing a significant ramp-up, as I said, in the vaccine program. Another measure of this is that we are now seeing the arrival every week of one million doses of Pfizer. Thanks also to the Prime Minister and national cabinet's agreed four-phase national plan, we're powering through this first phase by accelerating the vaccine rate. This does come at a price, though, and extending the tariff exemption for PPE over the forward estimates will cost in the order of $3.8 million, an investment I think we can all agree is absolutely well founded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this proposal relates to a free rate of customs duty on imported goods for use in the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF, program. This is the most advanced fighter jet in the world, and Australia should be very rightly proud to be a lead participant in this program. The use of the concessional item is limited to goods that are for use in the program and are not currently eligible for a free rate of customs duty. The F-35 has the capability to strengthen our national security, enhance global partnerships and power economic growth. This is a part of the Morrison government's commitment of $270 billion on defence capability over the next decade. This is of course in response to a complex and contested environment strategically, both in our region and right across the globe. Strong national security absolutely underpins also our economic prosperity and our ongoing social cohesion. We're living, as I said, in a contested region, and it is more important now than ever that we continue keeping Australians safe and sovereign, and investing in our military and our defence industry is how we are going to keep doing that. This measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $6.7 million over the forward estimates—again, a very appropriate expenditure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the third proposal is to provide a free rate of customs duty to certain motor vehicles and components imported for research and development activities by our automotive service providers. This tariff concession will be applicable till 30 June 2025. It enables automotive service providers who were previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme to continue accessing concessional treatment for eligible goods. This measure responds to concerns from industry that the end of the concession would significantly disrupt their research and development activities. As Australia looks towards more environmentally friendly modes of transport which are lower carbon, such as hybrid electric cars—and I mentioned emerging research into hydrogen powered vehicles—it's really important that we reduce the financial burden upon those who are undertaking this research and development and driving forward that leading edge of our lower-carbon future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target through a technology focused approach. That stems from our aversion to solving problems with taxes and preference for leveraging technology. That's where this bill absolutely lends a helping hand. Australia's Technology Investment Roadmap is expected to guide $20 billion worth of government investment over the next decade and drive around $80 billion in total new investment in low-emissions technologies in Australia by 2030. The 2021-22 budget includes $1.2 billion over 10 years for investments in low-emissions technology. This includes $565 million to establish international partnerships on practical low-emissions projects and $263 million to accelerate the development of carbon capture, use and storage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research shows that a hybrid vehicle can use 40 to 60 per cent less fuel and emit around 30 per cent less carbon dioxide than a conventional vehicle. Meanwhile, electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe CO2 emissions. If a 100 per cent renewable energy such as solar power is used to recharge the batteries, then the power is free and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Lower-carbon transport options are increasingly being selected by Australians. In fact, we saw the sale of EVs and plug-in hybrids increase by almost 300 per cent in 2019, to 6,718, compared to 2018, when it was 2,357. As I said, that is an incredible 300 per cent increase. That is why this government is investing in lower-carbon transport options, with the introduction of this proposal estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, we have shifted, and rightly so, in a range of priority areas, particularly those touching on PPE, defence industry and lower-carbon transport options. I commend this bill to the House, as it goes a long way to helping us achieve those objectives.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I don't agree with the amendment, although I do agree with the proposal put by the government in regard to the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. There are very few set-and-forget policies in government, particularly when it comes to tax and customs law. It is a scenario of constant change and adjustment. If it was Winston Churchill who said, 'When the facts change, sir, I change my mind,' he was completely on the money. Certainly, when it comes to issues of trade, we've seen many things change in recent years. The establishment of a number of free trade agreements—or freer trade agreements, as they probably should be referred to—moves by Australia in the field of antidumping, moves by other countries alleging dumping against Australia, those who take political positions and attack our trade status for, as the term would suggest, no better reason than pure politics are all things that we as a government have to face on virtually a daily or weekly basis. So, too, are the proposals that have been put up in these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia built a huge wall of tariffs in the early and middle parts of the last century. The dismantling of that great tariff wall began, of course, in the 1970s under Gough Whitlam, who moved for an immediate reduction of 25 per cent in all tariffs across the board. It was the beginning of a very long, drawn-out process of general tariff reduction by both sides of politics, which came to a halt, I suppose we should say, in the early 2000s, when the remnant tariff—and many would say Australia doesn't have any tariffs—was at five per cent, where it remains, on around 50 per cent of those goods that are termed to have a rateable tariff assessment. That's not to say that's on 50 per cent of the goods we import; it's nothing like that. It's that 50 per cent of tariff items still retain tariffs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It probably begs the question of why those remain, but I think the removal of tariffs generally has been good for Australia. There would be others that would argue differently, but certainly right back in the 1960s Bert Kelly argued strongly that one man's tariff is another man's job. It was Gough Whitlam who said at the time of Bert Kelly's passing that no one man from the backbench had ever done more towards a long-term Australian policy than Bert Kelly. Through those years, they have been reduced and Australia has flourished. People have said that there would be no jobs here, but in fact even today, in the midst of a COVID crisis, we have below five per cent unemployment, so it has been good for Australia and it will continue to be. While we might beg the question, as I said, why these five per cent tariffs remain, that is the status quo and has been the case for the best part of 20 years now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill deals with three different items under that tariff regime, and they're different from each other. The first item concerns medical goods, which of course provide hygiene and safety for us in dealing with COVID-19. I think the member for Longman went through the details, but the list includes masks, gloves, clothes, gowns, goggles, visors, protective glasses, disinfectants—but, I point out, not hand sanitiser—soaps, test kits, reagents and things of that nature. A decision was made in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, which was right back in February 2020, that, on a temporary basis, free status, which means no tariffs, should be applied to these goods to ensure that we do have supply in Australia. There's been a great ramp-up of manufacturing capacity in that time not just in Australia but also right around the world, and those things that are the first form of defence at the moment, being masks and other things, are in plentiful supply at least in a place like Australia. We'd already extended this exemption once. One would have hoped that by now perhaps the COVID crisis would be in retreat, but it's stubbornly refusing to go and is adapting itself and making itself more dangerous to society generally, so we need a further extension. I don't think there's any argument about any of the amendments in this bill for that matter, but I think that's a fully justifiable case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Joint Strike Fighter—the Lightning II, as it's called—Australia worked very hard to become a part of the global supply line for the JSF. We are one of nine nations that have won the ability to bid for content in these Joint Strike Fighters. We have 30 of them already in Australia of the 72 that we've ordered. Already that ability to bid to get into that supply line has been to the net benefit of Australia of around about $2 billion. That's quite a boost to our economy, but I think, even more than that, it integrates us into one of the very high-technology lines of the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of South Australia there's been a lot of investment by US, largely, and European defence contractors establishing bases here in Australia because they can see that the Australian government is committed to a higher budget level in this uncertain world for the development of technology and the supply of equipment to our defence forces after a historic low. They are here on the ground, and of course being a participating partner in the production of the Joint Strike Fighter has been of great benefit. We will see similar things—in fact, even better things, I think—when it comes to the construction of our frigates at the moment and our submarines in the medium-term future. We are also designated to become an assigned product supply provider, so we will be like the parts shop for the JSF in the Pacific region. That will be important—by definition, that is a highly specialised supply line—because, as a part of our obligations under winning those contracts, is a guarantee to our partners of neutrality on tax, and this exemption does exactly that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I was on a delegation in the US in 2015. We didn't get to see a JSF up close, and I still haven't, even though now they're in Australia. The member for Franklin and I sat in a simulator of the cockpit in Washington. I can fly an aeroplane but maybe not a JSF, I'd have to point out. The thing that got me was a pilot still relies on vision. You could sit in this cockpit and look through your lap. I thought, 'Gee, I forgot to bring my legs, the seat and the bottom of the aeroplane!' It's a surreal thing that the cameras that sit around this hi-tech operation give you the ability to look straight through yourself as it were. I found that a bit of a surreal experience, but the technology looked pretty good to me. I'm not an assessor of aeroplanes, it would be fair to say, but the fact we were involved in its production and are going to be the parts shop for the Pacific region is very important for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third set of items that we're dealing with today under this free status for tariffs is around the automotive supply industries. As we all know, we don't make any cars in Australia anymore. I heard from the shadow minister earlier that it was all the Liberal Party's fault, but he neglected to mention who was in government when Ford and Toyota exited the scene—actually, I think that was Ford and Mitsubishi, so I should be careful about throwing stones. We don't make cars anymore but we make components. There have been a number of components suppliers that have been able to swing over to international supply. To do that, they need to stay current with modern technologies and develop a new technology for the supply of these vehicles. It's very important they are able to import the particular products they need for testing and development. This was an exemption that they enjoyed under the previous car transformation plan, so this new addition is really a continuation of the status quo. Once again, it just makes sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These three items that we're addressing in this amendment all make sense. It's all good policy. It's just another show of governments being able to, as I say, chew gum and speak or walk at the same time. I don't know about chewing gum and speaking at the same time; maybe that's not etiquette. But either way, it is just the mechanics of government in getting on with the job. I commend the amendments.</span>

I also acknowledge my own country, the Noongar people of Western Australia, and say in our language, kaya wanju—hello and welcome. I acknowledge my Aboriginal parliamentary colleagues, the Hon. Linda Burney, Senator Pat Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Senator Jackie Lambie and Senator Olivia Thorpe. I also want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, who last week renewed his commitment to walk together with Indigenous Australians; to continue to listen, to learn; and a commitment to work together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago, the Commonwealth signed a new partnership agreement with the states and territories, the coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak organisations, and the Australian Local Government Association. That document said, 'From now on we will work together, no matter what,' and we are. From that partnership, our new national agreement was born, setting out our new priority reforms and the 17 outcomes and targets agreed to by all and ushering in a new era of action, evidence and accountability. Governments can do a lot, and we will, but we can't do it all. I acknowledge the work of Pat Turner and the other leaders of the peak bodies and note how critical our partnership and their efforts will be in this new era. I acknowledge the work of the National Indigenous Australians Agency and the incredible staff in that organisation, particularly the former CEO, Ray Griggs, and all public servants who were involved in the agreement's preparation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each of the states and territories and the peaks and the Commonwealth presented their own implementation plans last Friday, when we met as the Joint Council on Closing the Gap. Each one of those plans directly responds to the new priority reform areas and the new outcomes and targets. All governments will report to their respective parliaments on their progress towards achieving the targets and, critically, all of our efforts will be scrutinised more closely than ever before—not by us, ourselves, as we've done in the past, but by the independent Productivity Commission and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander led reviews that will occur. We're not going to waste this opportunity. We will build on the past. We'll be guided not by what we think works but what the data tells us. We will only continue to fund initiatives that we now know can deliver, ensuring the money spent goes as far as it can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was sworn in as Minister for Indigenous Australians, I promised that policy would not be made solely in my office; instead, I would only develop policy in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and I meant that. From visiting communities and speaking with elders around the country, this has become clear and urgent. Last year I had traditional owners at Katherine ask me, 'Why do you insist on acknowledging traditional owners and elders but you're not involving us in everyday things to do with our country?' They said, 'You as governments acknowledge us, but we don't see us sitting at the table talking about the importance of country and why we are the rightful owners and why we shouldn't have a say. So why do you acknowledge us but don't include us?' It's a simple question, one that governments have struggled to answer for far too long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, I've been challenged—challenged to think more deeply about how to honour my original promise, how to make our partnership's efforts more than just words in a report or ideas in a speech, how to make them real for our people. To make them mean something to every person in every community, what we need most in Indigenous affairs is pragmatism and real outcomes, practical actions that result in meaningful change for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and change through working in genuine partnership. That is our paradigm shift, which is now embedded in the Commonwealth Closing the Gap Implementation Plan. We are being rigorous with the evidence, we are listening, we are learning and we are pursuing what works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the latest step to do away with the old top-down approach without losing or downplaying the heart and intention of the commitments made by Prime Minister Rudd 13 years ago. But much has changed since then. What hasn't changed is the collective aspiration of our people to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children getting the best start in life and the same opportunities—schooling, health care and life outcomes—as their peers; to see more children in school and fewer children in custody; to see more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living healthier lives and fewer dying young. We want to see more opportunity and optimism, and more freedom to hope and to heal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to reflect on the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme the Prime Minister has just announced. I want to acknowledge Fiona Cornforth—who has done a brilliant job—Maisie Austin, Eileen Cummings and the Healing Foundation for their work to address trauma passed from generation to generation, in too many cases caused by the forced removal of children from their families. When I spoke with them, on several occasions I recalled my mother and her siblings who were members of the same experience. My mother spent her childhood years in Roelands mission out of Bunbury. Not only were all her siblings taken away from their parents, they were also separated from each other and spread hundreds of kilometres apart. As a child, and as a child of anybody who has been in an institution, I used to listen to their stories that they shared between themselves, and they expressed how they felt. I've read my mother's native welfare files, which include letters from her parents which make it very clear that her mother and father had not given up on wanting them back. They had not relinquished their parental rights. They'd never given her up. They continued loving and yearning for her all those years, and her for them. When I was talking with Maisie and Eileen, it brought back those memories of what they went through, and that's why we've done the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new redress scheme represents an important practical step forward to healing in this country and reflects our government's commitment to support a process of truth-telling as part of our nation's journey to reconciliation. All of us in cabinet share responsibility to create a better future for Indigenous Australians. In a sense, we are all ministers for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my hope that over the 10 years of this new Agreement on Closing the Gap, as well as through our efforts to co-design the Indigenous voice, my colleagues and I can work even more closely together to acknowledge the past, to build a better future as one, but, more importantly, to implement all of the initiatives that are outlined in the $1 billion commitment in the Commonwealth's implementation plan. I think the strength of this approach of a partnership with 51 peak organisations, with Indigenous communities, but where state and territory governments are now accountable in their own parliaments, makes our task as a Commonwealth to be facilitators for a better future, that it addresses all those elusive areas in which gaps have continued to exist. Out-of-home care, incarceration rates and the general ones that we've always focused on are all critically important. And, whilst the challenge in some of the circumstances that people live in remote and isolated communities will be tough, nevertheless I know that both sides of this chamber are committed to ensuring that we collectively close the gap that exists. It gives us an incredible opportunity to work in a bipartisan approach over the next 10 years to see a future in which a child born today at the age of 10 will have better opportunities, better pathways and enjoy the same privileges that an Australian child does in any other context.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the contribution of my long-term friend Linda Burney for the work that she has done over our years of being advocates in a number of areas, and the member for Barton knows full well how important these gap closures are if we are going to see a change in the quality of lives. Even in capital cities, those gaps exist. What we have to do is look for solutions that will ensure that the challenges are addressed and we see the outcomes that we seek through all of the implementation plans and the Closing the Gap implementation agreement. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Prime Minister delivered the latest Closing the Gap update. Sadly, and unsurprisingly, the data shows that disparity and disadvantage remain. It has been more than two years since the Prime Minister promised the new approach to closing the gap that Minister Wyatt spoke about. There were three targets—target 13, family violence; target 14, suicides; and target 17, Indigenous inclusion—that do not have any comparison data for non-Indigenous populations. Even if the adult incarceration goal were to be met, a reduction of 15 per cent by 2031—a goal that Labor has consistently argued needs to be more ambitious—the rate would still be more than 11 times higher than that for the non-Indigenous population. Even if the youth incarceration goal were to be met, a reduction of 30 per cent by 2031, the rate would still be more than 12 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. And even if the out-of-home-care goal were to be met, a 45 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be five times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. We can't allow ourselves to become desensitised to this deprivation. Hearing Minister Wyatt's story of his own family brings that home. These are not just statistics; these are people's lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week Labor has sought to break this cycle of policy stagnation. Our leader charted a practical and sensible way forward for closing the gap through empowering First Nations people. Listening to and empowering First Nations people is at the very heart of Labor's approach to closing the gap. We remain committed to a constitutionally enshrined voice and we will put a referendum to the nation within the first term of an Albanese Labor government, but we will also make makarrata—treaty and truth telling—a priority. I say to all Australians: truth telling is not about shame or guilt. It is about moving forward. But we can't move forward by pretending that one part of the country has not been subjected to structural, industrial-scale disadvantage for centuries. If we want to understand the challenges, the disadvantage and the inequities of the present, it is crucial that we understand the roots of past trauma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trauma of the past does not simply stay in the past. It has transcended generations, and we all see that. This is one of the fundamental and very practical functions of truth telling. A makarrata commission will be independent and have responsibility for truth telling and treaty making. It will work with the voice to parliament when it is established. It would oversee the establishment of an effective model of local truth-telling, including the support of local communities. It would inquire into matters of overarching national significance, including the causes of inequity from colonisation to the present day. It would recall and tell positive stories of survival and culture, as well as making an official record of colonisation, massacres, discrimination and resistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to treaty, it would recommend a framework for federal treaty making, taking into account the good work that has already been undertaken on this by the states and territories. It will consult with First Nations communities and will report within the first term of a Labor government. There can be no real progress on closing the gap and there can be no reconciliation without treaty and truth-telling. Labor's commitment to making Makarrata a priority will realise these crucial elements of the Uluru statement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we also saw the Prime Minister rule out a First Nations voice to the parliament before the next election. One of the desires expressed by First Nations people through the Uluru statement was a greater say in decisions, policies and laws that affect us—a generous and reasonable ask from a people who have survived centuries of dispossession, massacres and the destruction of families and communities—a new iteration of self-determination, not binding and certainly not a third chamber, but safe and secure from the whims of political interference from the government of the day through constitutional enshrinement. The Australian government asked First Peoples for their vision of constitutional recognition and reform, and this is it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few remaining minutes that I have, I want to quickly touch on the fact that Labor welcomes the establishment of a stolen generations compensation scheme. It was Labor that took stolen generations reparations to the last election: $75,000 in compensation plus $7,000 in auxiliary payments. We welcome the government coming onboard with this, never forgetting that there are members of this chamber today who walked out on the National Apology to the Stolen Generations 13½ years ago. We know that the Rudd Labor government's commencement of the national effort to close the gap as part of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations was in recognition of the issue of stolen generations. It recognises that the disparities and inequities we see today are inexplicably linked to the deprivation that arose from those paternalistic and misguided policies that the minister has outlined with his own family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will charter a practical and sensible way on closing the gap. This is why in the past week Labor has committed to a national process of treaty making and truth-telling. A clear and accurate telling of Australia's story is essential to helping us better understand and explain the causes of inequity and injustice. We have committed to strengthen economic and job opportunities for First Nations people, particularly through the Indigenous rangers program. Economic equality is absolutely fundamental. We can't have an addressing of structural disadvantage more broadly otherwise. Listening to and empowering First Nations people is clearly reflected in Labor's approach to closing the gap. I recognise my party, I recognise the minister in the chair, and I also commit on behalf of Anthony Albanese to the many issues he raised in closing the gap last week.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  [by video link] It's an honour to follow both the minister and the shadow minister and to be followed by my good friend the Member for Lingiari in this debate, all three of whom have done much to educate me and share their knowledge of Australia's Indigenous people and have committed their lives to the betterment of our First Nations people. I'd like to start today in speaking about the important work of the Commonwealth Closing the Gap implementation plan by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land in my electorate where I'm coming from today, the Dharug and Kuringgai people, and paying my respect to their elders past and present. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a different Closing the Gap statement. It acknowledges we've entered into a new era of partnership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through the Coalition of Peaks and governments, and, in saying 'governments'—plural—I mean Commonwealth, state and territory. There are two firsts in this process: the involvement of Aboriginal people in setting and delivering against the targets, and the involvement of all governments. One of the things I think is poorly understood is that, although in 1967 the people gave the Commonwealth power to make laws about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the truth is that most of the laws and policies which affect our First Nations people are made by the states and territories. So bringing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all levels of government to the table is something of a watershed moment in our history. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the leadership of the minister, the Prime Minister and Pat Turner in bringing this about. The way this Closing the Gap process has taken place is, in my view, a harbinger of what the voice can potentially achieve. It shows that real change can be achieved when you listen to and involve Indigenous people in the decisions that affect them. Speaking of watershed moments, I note that the Prime Minister in his remarks in the Closing the Gap statement added that 17 August marks 50 years since Neville Bonner delivered his maiden speech to the senate and became the first Indigenous person to serve in the parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to say something about Neville Bonner in these remarks as I had the privilege of getting to know Neville in February 1998 when we were both elected ACM—No Republic delegates at the constitutional convention. He was No. 2 on our Queensland senate ticket behind Sir James Killen. Like the other ACM delegates, we stayed at the Garden City Premier Inn at Narrabundah during that hot February fortnight. Neville wasn't well. He was suffering from the cancer that ultimately killed him. At night he'd join other ACM delegates for a drink and dinner and he was often found outside having a smoko. He was warm, friendly and encouraging of this young bloke, and I remember the many distinctive rings he had on his fingers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neville and I served on an important subcommittee of that convention: a cross-party grouping comprising both republicans and monarchists on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It was the only truly bipartisan recommendation of that convention and was about having a referendum on Indigenous constitutional recognition regardless of your position on the republic. The committee was the genesis of my personal involvement in that issue, and I still regard constitutional recognition as important unfinished business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neville Bonner made one of the two truly remarkable addresses to that convention, the other made by Sir James Killen. These two great parliamentarians—giants of our postwar politics—followed one another, and I was privileged to be in the chamber to hear these great orations. Bonner raised issues that day 23 years ago which are still with us and remain central to closing the gap. He said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From the bottom of my heart, I pray to you: stop this senseless division. Let us work together on the real issues. Let us solve those problems which haunt my people—the problems of land, of health, of unemployment, of the despair and hopelessness which leads even to suicide. Let us unite this country, not divide it ever—that toy of those who already have too much: mere symbolism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He then said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end what I have already said by singing my Jagera sorry chant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he left us spellbound with that awe-inspiring chant. Even now I get goosebumps thinking about it. That chant provoked a long standing ovation—the only one of the convention. Reflecting on the day of his own maiden speech on 17 August 1971, Bonner on another occasion had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As they were leading me up, I looked up and around the galleries and I could feel the whole Aboriginal race, of those who had gone before, were all up there, and I could visualise, I could hear voices and amongst those voices was the voice of my grandfather saying, 'It's alright now boy, you are finally in the council with the Australian Elders. Everything is now going to be alright.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't make the promise that everything is going to be alright now, but we can promise to honour the memory of Neville Bonner by working to make this Closing the Gap Commonwealth parliamentary implementation plan successful in what it seeks to do. It seeks to address disadvantage, to build opportunities for Indigenous Australians and to build partnerships for working together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed a billion dollars to support new measures delivering on its commitments to co-design and work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and I think it's worthwhile mentioning some of those measures. I want to say something about the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme, and I think the shadow minister has already mentioned the financial compensation elements of it. I think there is actually a deeper and more important part of the redress scheme—that is, the opportunity for each survivor to confidentially tell their story about the impact of their removal to a senior official within government, and to have it acknowledged and receive a face-to-face written apology for the removal and resulting trauma. Too often in our country, people feel they are not being listened to by government and have nowhere to go to tell their story. So I think that this aspect is very important. One only needed to hear the voice of Pat Turner at the press conference, talking about her own mother's circumstances, to see how powerful such a measure will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several measures in relation to closing the gap around child care and education which I think are important. There is $120 million to improve the lives of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through better access to early childhood education. As we know, one of the best ways to improve people's lot in life is to ensure they have a good start with quality early childhood education, particularly for people who are disadvantaged—whether it is through the $81 million for an extra 27 new Connected Beginnings sites benefiting around 8½ thousand children, or money to fund up to 20 new childcare services in remote communities, or $9 million to create four new early years education programs in Queensland and Victoria. These will be significant measures. Importantly, there will be a $2 million trial of a new early learning teaching model to strengthen literacy and numeracy through explicit instruction. Evidence shows that play based learning alone may not be enough for some children and that explicit instruction can be more effective. The plan focuses not only on early education; it also focuses on greater investment in secondary schooling. There is $75 million to improve options for secondary schooling for Indigenous children in remote communities and a $25 million investment in Scaling Up Success, a program that ensures the best evidence based programs are used in our primary schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the privilege of chairing the House Indigenous affairs committee and I want to say how important it is that we focus on Closing the Gap target 8, which is that by 2031 we will have increased to 62 per cent the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 25 to 64 who are employed. That number currently sits at 51 per cent. The Indigenous affairs committee is currently undertaking an inquiry looking at pathways to economic opportunity for Indigenous Australians around employment and small business. Our committee has heard evidence from a number of businesses that are working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to build partnerships and identify opportunities for training and employment, and I want to revisit some of the evidence we have heard. Voyages is a company that, prior to COVID, employed 1,100 people in Central Australia, 400 of whom were Indigenous. They are the largest employer of Indigenous people in Central Australia. They run the National Indigenous Training Academy in partnership with the William Angliss Institute and Charles Darwin University. They are a training-to-employment organisation providing people with great opportunities in the hospitality and horticulture sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from Woolworths, one of the largest employers of Indigenous Australians, employing 5,000 Indigenous people across the country, about their important cultural training and mentoring initiatives. We heard from the Accor hotels group, who have targets for the number of contracts of value procured from Indigenous businesses. Since the imposition of those targets, they have reported seeing an upward trend in their engagement with Indigenous business. We heard from the Minerals Council, who said they are working in partnership to provide pathways for skills training and business development. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up about 3.8 per cent of the mining workforce, and the number of Indigenous employees directly employed in mining has more than doubled in the decade to 2016. We also have heard much about the growth in Indigenous business, especially but not exclusively from the success of the government's Indigenous Procurement Policy, and the important links between Indigenous small business and Indigenous employment. An Indigenous businesses is 100 times more likely than a non-Indigenous business to employ other Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the focus of this new Closing the Gap initiative is on partnerships. Partnerships are essential. They build connections between governments and our First Nations people and build opportunities across the country. We will continue to work to build those opportunities until we reach the day when children can grow up and, regardless of whether they are Indigenous or non-Indigenous, have the same expectations as any other Australian.</span>

                  <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  Firstly, let me say what an honour it is to be able to speak in this debate. I want to acknowledge the contribution just made by the member for Berowra, someone I've come to call a friend, even though we have diverse—I would say, very different—views on a range of matters. We've been working cooperatively together and in concert, along with my colleague the member for Newcastle, on the Aboriginal affairs committee. It's been a pleasure to work with him. I know I've learned a bit, and I hope he's learned something along the way as well. Thank you very much for your contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Hasluck for the work he's been doing. We don't agree all the time, but his intentions are clear. I want to give him whatever support I can in his role. I would like to commend the member for Barton for her contribution, following on from the Leader of the Opposition's statement last week. They are significant statements in themselves and they bring to mind many of the things we need to properly comprehend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been in this place for some time, I've been able to observe and be part of decisions and discussions which have caused hurt and heartache. I vividly remember 13 February 2008 and the apology by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. I'm sad, though, because the previous Prime Minister refused to apologise and referred to the 'black armband view of history'. When we contemplate the insult that that means, and where we are now in Australia when we discuss these issues, we must acknowledge how wrong he was. Those members of this chamber who either didn't appear at or walked out of the apology by Kevin Rudd are shamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the government for the reparation scheme they announced for the stolen generations last week. As the member for Barton said, it was a commitment made by Labor at the last election, and I'm glad the government have picked it up. Following Kevin Rudd's apology, there were many people who had tears of relief and hope. But so many of those people who applauded, acknowledged and were part of that decision and who saw the fulfilment of that apology have passed, so they will not be beneficiaries of this new scheme. That's sad. I just hope we can get the current government, with great respect to the member for Hasluck, and the current Prime Minister to listen to people and to hear their advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the role of the wonderful Pat Turner and the Coalition of Peaks. Pat is a friend and was a neighbour in Alice Springs. I know she's a formidable individual and someone with a great deal of experience but who is grounded in her family and in her community. I commend her for the role she's had in this Closing the Gap approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noted the Prime Minister's foreword in the report, in which he said, 'Too many opportunities have been missed to listen and to learn.' Can I say, Prime Minister, there is no point just having selective hearing. We heard from Uluru, from the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We heard what people around this country want: a constitutionally entrenched voice. And now, as a result of the statement from last week, it is clear that we won't have a voice legislated during the course of this parliament, let alone any commitment to enshrine a voice in the Constitution. That's why it's important to contemplate and understand the merit in the three parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart: the entrenched voice, the makarrata and truth-telling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Truth-telling goes to the heart of where we're at. We as a nation have to appreciate and understand the extent of the institutionalised racism that has been the driver of our governments for over a century. That has to go. If that has to go, it means the Prime Minister not only has to say we've missed opportunities but now has to listen, learn and appreciate the intelligence and charity with which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders speak to us, the government, as a parliament. They speak with respect, but that respect needs to be returned by way of action. I note the priority reform targets within this new statement, the partnership and shared decision-making, the building of the community controlled sector, the sharing of access to data and information at a regional level and the transforming of government organisations. These are commendable objectives, but at their heart they mean listening to people and responding in a serious way to close the gap in health, education, employment, housing and so forth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Leader of the Opposition for the announcements that he made last week and the commitments that he made on behalf of the Labor Party not only to the voice but to the issues that were raised by the member for Barton about education and health. If I may, I want to make one observation about the member for Berowra's contribution and the money that, as a result of last week, has been promised by this government for boarding facilities for remote communities. I ask the government to look at the reports of this parliament. The House of Representatives committee for which the member for Berowra is chairman brought down a report on education specifically around the issues to do with boarding schools. It has clearly not been read, appreciated or understood by this government, just as it has made observations about explicit instruction, particularly direct instruction. I ask the government to look seriously at these reports. The member for Berowra, the member for Newcastle and I are involved in the inquiry, as was the member for Durack. Look! We've got them all here! They will understand what I'm talking about. I say to you: please, please listen; read what has been researched and the advice that has been given by that committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I travel around the bush, which I do often, there are a number of driving requests that I have constantly, but there are two that are most important: housing and employment. We hear of housing because of the inadequacy of it and the failure of governments to properly respond in terms of making allocations that will address need. We think there's a shortfall of some billions of dollars, perhaps $5 billion, in housing alone in the Northern Territory. The other area is CDP. I know the member for Durack appreciates and understands what I'm going to say here. Labor is committed to scrapping the current Community Development Program. We are committed to developing a new community based program, possibly designed on the principles of the old CDEP system. That's what the community are asking for. I say to the Prime Minister and the member for Durack: if you think it's time to listen and learn, well, listen, learn and act. That's what we require you to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (18<span class="HPS-Time">:39</span>):  Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and their elders past, present and emerging. I was very pleased last week to see the Prime Minister announce this government's latest Closing the Gap implementation plan, along with the redress scheme. It was extremely pleasing to see that language was specifically recognised as part of the rich inheritance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—it's something I have been working with Indigenous people in my communities to expand—an inheritance that Closing the Gap, in that respect, specifically seeks to protect. There are 123 languages across our country, but only 14 of those are considered to be strong. This government's target, between now and 2031, is a steady increase in the number and strength of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community languages being spoken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to see, having spent 12 years enforcing the law and 18 years defending the law, a new focus on justice with new targets set so that, by 2031, we will reduce the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults in custody by 15 per cent and juveniles by 30 per cent. There are far too many young Indigenous people in custody, and the low-hanging fruit here is to look at those offences that send people to jail that don't involve public safety, such as traffic offences that involve an administrative component. There are people in custody right now serving terms of imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified. That potentially could have started because that young Indigenous man or that young Indigenous woman didn't have a birth certificate, so therefore they couldn't get a licence and, therefore, they drove without a licence on multiple occasions. It's not so much a public safety offence as an administrative offence, which can see them in prison for up to two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very pleased to speak with former Aboriginal affairs minister Robert Tickner, who is now serving as the chair of the Justice Reform Initiative. I know that he has done a lot of work, both in his past life and since leaving this place, for the advancement of Indigenous people and their culture. If he requires any assistance, I look forward to offering him that assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the Commonwealth doesn't manage those justice systems, but where we can make a difference is in bringing people together and the provision of additional funding for support, such as the $9.3 million for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services to better manage complex cases and coronial inquiries. I have seen how stretched that they are in their funding, so it was pleasing to see that. A further $8.2 million in funding is for family dispute resolution programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this Closing the Gap implementation plan is a commitment by the government to work in partnership with and to listen to Indigenous peoples. Quite clearly the key two words in my last sentence were 'partnership' and 'listen', because that is exactly what this government—all governments at all levels—must do: that is, partner with our Indigenous people and listen, really listen, to our Indigenous people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Cowper, we have a significant number of Indigenous people through Coffs Harbour, Kempsey, Bowraville and the wider Nambucca area. I acknowledge the Birrbay people and the Dhanggati-Thangatti and Gumbaynggirr nations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month the government announced $126 million to help improve education for thousands of Indigenous students. Education is a key part of our government's plan to close the gap. I accept that there is still that massive chasm. NAPLAN data shows that Indigenous students are, on average, more than two years behind their non-Indigenous peers in year 3. And that gap continues to grow over time. So this significant financial boost will hopefully help focus on scaling up programs that we know lift outcomes for our Indigenous students. The primary focus will be on important areas such as reading, maths, attendance at school and school completion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Coffs Harbour, in my own electorate, Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom School is looking to open in early 2022. I was very pleased to bring Minister Wyatt down and speak to him about that project. That project aims to establish the Gumbaynggirr Giingana school, an Aboriginal bilingual independent primary school, for Aboriginal students on the Coffs Coast. Clark Webb, the CEO, is a remarkable young man. He established the Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation, and he is the driving force behind this plan. 'Bularri muurlay nyanggan' translates to 'two paths strong' in the Gumbaynggirr language. Their footprint extends from the Nambucca Valley all the way up to Grafton, and they're currently engaged with over 200 people in cultural and educational programs each year. The organisation was formed 10 years ago, and it now includes three Goori learning centres, a Nyanggan tutoring program, Gumbaynggirr language and cultural revitalisation programs, the Wajaarr Ngaarlu dance troupe, cultural camps, the Nyanggan Gapi Cafe and a cultural experience tourism venture. Clark is a very proud First Nations man who was raised to never allow anyone to make him believe the Goori people are any less than anyone else. That great strength in his heritage shows that, when Indigenous children are strong in their identity, they engage much better in learning. Once operational, the school will provide a culturally strong, safe and thriving learning environment where the Gumbaynggirr world view and language drive and enrich the entire learning experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Closing the Gap Implementation Plan sets out the actions this government is taking to drive and embed real and positive change. Each relevant stakeholder must be part of a collaborative effort to achieve this desired outcome during this process. Importantly, the programs and policies to achieve our goals will be the responsibility of all involved—everyone. This is being achieved through the partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, a true partnership. This relationship is central to the design and monitoring of specific actions under the implementation plan, evolving the way we work together to better deliver the desired outcomes for the Indigenous community and Australians as a whole. The implementation plan will require significant change in how all governments work on all levels. Like previous efforts in closing the gap, socioeconomic targets have been set to measure whether efforts are being made to make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said last week, this announcement reflects the government's commitment to recognising and acknowledging the wrongs of the past as part of a nation's journey to reconciliation, and this scheme represents a major step forward towards healing. This is a journey for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  It is a great honour to be part of this debate on the statement on closing the gap this year. I want to make my own acknowledgement that we are meeting, as this parliament does every day, on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people. I acknowledge their contribution to our community and region and acknowledge their elders past, present and emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great honour to follow many of the speakers in this debate, who have devoted their lives to reconciliation and to closing that gap in the lives of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I want to acknowledge the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister, the member for Barton, who spoke before me, and also the member for Lingiari, who, in his many years in this place, has worked very hard on this issue. It is an honour to be on our Labor First Nations caucus committee with the member for Barton and Senators McCarthy and Dodson, and to work with them on these issues. It was a particular honour on Reconciliation Day here in the ACT to host a panel discussion on reconciliation with Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy and the member for Barton, and to hear their views on reconciliation and, very much so, the importance of the Uluru Statement from the Heart to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at closing the gap each year, the depth of the gap that is experienced between First Nations people and other Australians is a shame on this nation. This year is no different. Of 17 targets, only three are on track to be met. As the member for Grayndler, our leader, said in his statement:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A gap is something that is easily crossed or closed. The unflinching litany of lopsided statistics before us makes it clear that this is a chasm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Indigenous Australians are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated than their non-Indigenous peers and they make up 100 per cent of children in detention in the Northern Territory. Indigenous Australians are the most incarcerated group of people on this earth, and that is a shame on this nation and this parliament. Indigenous children today are being placed in out-of-home care at 10 times the rate of non-Indigenous children and make up 36 per cent of children living away from their parents, even though they represent only six per cent of all children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at the targets, even if the adult incarceration goal were to be met, which is a 15 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be more than 11 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. Even if the youth incarceration goal were to be met, a 30 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be more than 12 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. And even if the out-of-home-care goal for children were met, a 45 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be five times higher than that for the non-Indigenous population. And there isn't even a defined suicide reduction goal—there's a range of trajectories, from a 20 per cent to a 75 per cent reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Barton has said, we must not become desensitised to this level of deprivation. As others have also talked about, what is central to solving these problems, which we see after years of looking at the Closing the Gap targets every year, is that we need to do this differently. We have listened to First Nations Australians through the process of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and they have said what it is they want to change. They have respectfully asked this parliament for voice, treaty and truth, but that respect, at this point, is not being returned. We are not truly listening to First Nations Australians until we implement this in full, and that will help to address these problems. We, as non-Indigenous Australians, cannot begin to fully understand the intergenerational trauma that is experienced as a result of the settlement of this country. But what we can't ignore is that the dispossession of First Nations Australians is fundamental to the establishment of Australia as we know it today, and that trauma continues in these statistics that we look at each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru statement has asked for truth-telling, for a process in order to come to terms with our very dark history in this country, and to move on from that. As the member for Barton also said, truth-telling is not about shame or guilt, but about moving forward, and that is something that we need to do together. The statement has asked for a voice to this parliament, a constitutionally enshrined voice to this parliament so that the answers to some of these problems can be found independent of the government of the day. This is incredibly important, and this is something that I'm proud that Labor is committed to in full. I call on the government and the Greens party to follow us in this. It is incredibly important to address these issues and have a voice enshrined in the Constitution to give a meaningful voice to this parliament on how to address the trauma and the issues facing First Nations people today. The Uluru statement has asked for a treaty, a makarrata commission, and a Labor government would be committed to establishing this with urgency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we saw the Prime Minister announce a $380 million redress scheme for survivors of the stolen generations in the ACT, the Northern Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. Labor welcomes this, of course, and I particularly want to welcome it on behalf of my Canberra community, many of whom will be impacted by this. I want to acknowledge that, while there is a financial payment in recognition of the unthinkable treatment that people endured, an important part of this scheme is also the opportunity to tell their story, if they would like to, and to receive an apology. I acknowledge how important that is for the broader addressing of this. We welcome that, but we need to do so much more. We need to be listening to First Nations people about how to address some of these issues, and that is exactly what a voice to parliament that is enshrined in the Constitution, a makarrata commission, would enable us to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are proven ways to reduce the causes of incarceration and deaths in custody. It has been more than 30 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its findings and 339 recommendations. But, tragically, hundreds of First Nations Australians have died in custody or in police pursuits since then. I commend the Change the Record movement for what they have been doing on that. A key issue linked to the incarceration of Indigenous people in Australia is the age of criminal responsibility. I'm proud that the ACT is the first jurisdiction to commit to lowering this, as the UN has recommended, because at the moment in this country children as young as 10 can be incarcerated. I think that is clearly wrong. I'm proud that the ACT has made that commitment, but it is something that all states and territories will hopefully move towards, and it is something we should address with urgency. There are proven ways to reduce the causes of incarceration and deaths in custody, and Labor has announced a plan to turn the tide on incarceration and deaths in custody by building on the success of the existing justice reinvestment programs in Bourke to tackle the root causes of crime and reoffending. These include rehabilitation services, family or domestic violence support, homelessness support and school retention initiatives. Where we see programs that are working, we should try to replicate them. Labor will provide specific standalone funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services to ensure First Nations families can access culturally appropriate, timely and fair legal assistance before, during and after all coronial processes, and Labor would ensure that deaths in custody are nationally reported in real time. It is extraordinary that in 2021 this counts as innovation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1967 First Nations people asked to be counted, and in 2017 they asked to be heard. I call on the government to implement the Uluru statement in full.</span>

Amongst other things, the work that the member for Parkes did has been noted and recognised in the fact that Indigenous Australians have not suffered a death, as was acknowledged by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Grayndler, during this global pandemic. The fact that we as a nation have been able to keep this deadly virus out of those remote Aboriginal communities is something we can all be very proud of, something where we can all say we've done a good job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, much more work to be done, as there is much more work to be done in this particular motion with closing the gap. Each and every year we stand here as members of parliament and acknowledge that the work continues. Certainly we can be pleased with some of the targets that we have reached, but we can also look at many of the others, including the incarceration rates, and say there is much more to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to be with the minister to attend the Barunga Festival in the Northern Territory in June and the following day go to Mornington Island. This followed a visit from the Mornington Island mayor, Councillor Kyle Yanner, and a group of his supporters and advocates for a better deal for his very remote shire, his very remote community, with a population just a tick over 1,000 in the Gulf of Carpentaria. They came to see me. I was Deputy Prime Minister at the time and I knew that I was going to be Acting Prime Minister in the not-too-distant future, so I thought what better opportunity to go to this island than in that capacity, in that role, and to hear and listen to those communities and their needs and wants. I think this strikes at the very heart of what we are addressing here with closing the gap. This is a community that has large gaps which indeed need to be closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pleasure to visit the island, to be shown around this small community and to hear the sorts of issues that they need dealt with, including overcrowding in their housing. This community was identified by the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Courier Mail</span> as a community that had been largely forgotten by the mainland, and I wanted to assure that community that it had not been forgotten, was not being forgotten and will not be forgotten in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I left the role of Deputy Prime Minister, there weren't many things that I did ask to follow up, because I'd done a lot of them. But one of the things that I really wanted to see ticked off—and I will follow it up and I have also spoken to Councillor Yanner—was that I wanted the Mornington Island issue supported. To that end, they have applied for a Building Better Regions Fund for a water park or a swimming pool. It is extraordinary that in the 21st century a community of that size in that area, with the heat and the climate that they deal with not just every summer but indeed every day, don't have a water park for their children. I really would like to see that as part of the BBRF, and, if their application is not successful for whatever reason, then I think we as a government have an obligation to support that in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to go to Barunga the day before, on 12 June in fact, as Acting Prime Minister. I was the highest ranked MP who had visited the festival since Bob Hawke in 1988. With more than 4,000 attendees, the cultural, musical and sporting festival they put on has to be seen to be believed. The Barunga Festival director, Mark Grose, said the pandemic has had an impact on remote Indigenous communities, many of whom have been unable to travel throughout the last year. He said, 'Nothing is more important than keeping people safe, and we are so glad that with the assistance of NT Health and NT Police a sense of togetherness could be reintroduced to start the mental healing of communities after lockdown. Barunga has once again shown the way.' Indeed it did. It was a marvellous festival. I know that Minister Wyatt and many other MPs; senators, including Senator Sam McMahon; and Northern Territory MPs from both political persuasions were there. I know the member for Lingiari was there. We shared in some fellowship but we shared in the common goal of ensuring that this festival remains a feature of the Northern Territory calendar and that we need to do everything we can and will in the future for Closing the Gap measures and interventions and for Closing the Gap togetherness, as MPs, above the political partisanship that we often show. This needs to be done on a bipartisan level and there was certainly a lot of bipartisanship at the festival.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that these communities require more infrastructure, and the road leading to this site and this particular camping ground also needs to be fixed up. I would like to see that done as part of the enormous amount of money that we are spending on Northern Territory infrastructure. I know that we as a government will work closely with the Gunner government in the Northern Territory to see if we can do that in the future, because it would be money well spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 35 years the Barunga Festival has been a special event not just for the Northern Territory but indeed for Australia. It brings Indigenous communities together to meet, to compete and to share. The invitation is always there for non-Indigenous Australians to experience a unique window into this remote community and its unique way of life. It is celebrated for the community rather than politics. Its simplicity, potency and focus on people has created a natural case study in reconciliation. Those words come from the Barunga Festival promoters. They are words very well spoken, because what that weekend again highlighted and showed to me is that Indigenous communities do want to take a lot of responsibility for and leadership of their own destiny and their own future. What is done by the Barunga Festival promoters and the Mornington Island community and its leaders, led so very well by Councillor Yanner—he's only a young bloke, but he's doing some mighty things and I know he's got the community's heart and belief very much at the core of his being. They will do some great things, but they will need the assistance of this government and of this parliament. I've given them the assurance that they will certainly  have that from me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to the home, I acknowledge the work that is being done around the Riverina and central west by Wiradjuri elders. I commend what Stan Grant Sr has done in ensuring that the Wiradjuri language has not been lost. The volumes of work that he has produced certainly feature in my home library. They are a good resource for the Wiradjuri language. It is important to acknowledge, and I know this fact was acknowledged by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition last week, that Aboriginal languages need preserving and protecting and to be taught in Australian schools for those students and by those schools who wish to do so. I know this is going to be an important fact going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is much more work that can, that will and that must be done to close the gap in terms of life span, in terms of health outcomes, in terms of incarceration rates and the like for Indigenous Australians. We need to make sure that we continue to do what we can. I know the 5 August declaration, the Commonwealth releasing its first Closing the Gap Implementation Plan, is a good start, but much more work needs to be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  Last week Australians learnt that, just a year after the Morrison government announced it was resetting the Closing the Gap targets, only three of those 17 targets are now on track. So I do welcome the government's announcement last week that it will now provide substantial resources to try to get these targets back on track, and all the more so if this is new money that is being allocated and not simply existing commitments being taken from one vital program and being redirected to others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I believe I join with the vast majority of Australians in welcoming the decision to at last fund a redress scheme for the surviving members of the stolen generations. I've had a long personal connection to many members of that group, having acted for them in the test case we brought to the Federal Court and the High Court, and which the Howard government then threw all the legal resources of the Commonwealth at in defeating. I hope that this new redress scheme is rolled out quickly and smoothly to deliver a measure of justice for surviving members of the stolen generations and to help address some of the intergenerational trauma those terrible policies of the federal government caused over those years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this redress program to be effective, it is important that the government does not repeat any of the multitude of mistakes it has made administering the redress scheme for victim-survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. With many members of the stolen generation already, sadly, having passed away and many others now approaching the end of their lives, I call on the government to recognise that, in this case, justice delayed is justice denied absolutely, and that the government must approach this redress scheme with a true sense of urgency. Labor made clear that, while we welcome justice targets, the justice targets set by this government are not ambitious enough. But to achieve even these unambitious targets will require significant action to be taken, because the relationship between First Nations people and the Australian justice system is an ongoing area of great difficulty. This government needs to start listening to Indigenous Australians about how to change that relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I note that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have long played a vital role in mediating and, to the extent they can, ensuring just outcomes for First Nations people who encounter the justice system. Until last year, ATSILS operated with a significant degree of autonomy in carrying out their vital role. But last year the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services were, against the strident objections of their leadership and the communities that they serve, folded into a newly established national mechanism by the former Attorney-General.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision directly contradicted not only the clearly expressed views of the Indigenous community but also the very first recommendation of the government's own review of the Indigenous legal assistance program that was commissioned and received by the government last year. That first recommendation stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To facilitate a sustainable, community-controlled Indigenous legal assistance sector, Commonwealth Government funding should continue to be delivered through a standalone, specific purpose funding program with minimum five-year funding terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous groups expressed outrage at this decision by the government. In an open letter, some 100 organisations stated that the Morrison government's decision to ignore the key recommendation of the ILAP review was 'disappointing', not least because the federal government has been committed to and responsible for the funding and administration of ATSILS since their inception almost 50 years ago. This began after the 1967 referendum in recognition of the Commonwealth's special responsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is important to retain this Commonwealth leadership. The organisations continued:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All evidence and research show that working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and ACCOs is the best way forward. The Federal Government should honour its long-standing commitment, keep ILAP and adequately fund ATSILS to close the justice gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that this misconceived approach to Indigenous justice shown by those actions last year is now behind us, and that the government will now seek to engage more respectfully and more constructively with First Nations communities on how to achieve the Closing the Gap justice targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I welcome the specific commitment by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Indigenous Australians of additional funding of $9.3 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services for expensive and complex cases and to support criminal justice reform through coronial inquiries, $8.3 million for culturally safe and appropriate dispute resolution for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and $7.6 million to establish and support the justice policy partnership between all Australian governments and Indigenous representatives. As always, we need to see this announcement matched with delivery and, if we are to even come close to reaching these new targets, for this money to be rolled out quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a great deal more I could say about justice targets and about the commitments that Labor has already made to improve justice outcomes if we win government, including through a commitment to expand and strengthen justice reinvestment programs. But justice is about far more than just court cases; justice is about far more than keeping people out of jail, so I want to say a little bit about what I feel is this federal government's betrayal of justice in its broader sense. In my view, in its undermining of meaningful action on all three of the requests in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, this government is betraying the hopes and aspirations of First Nations people and, in doing that, betraying justice in its broadest sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike this government, Labor is committed to honouring the Uluru Statement from the Heart and, through this, to working towards justice and a genuine reconciliation with First Nations people. Honouring the Uluru statement includes working with First Nations people to establish an Indigenous voice to the parliament enshrined in our nation's Constitution. We in Labor are committed to making that happen. The Morrison government is opposed to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru statement also calls for a national process of treaty and truth-telling overseen by a makarrata commission. Labor has committed to honouring that request by establishing in government as a matter of priority a makarrata commission. That commission's oversight of truth-telling would include inquiring into matters of national significance from colonisation to the present day as well as supporting local truth-telling projects with local government and community organisations. And the commission's oversight of treaty would include developing a framework for federal treaty-making, taking into account existing state and territory processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has shown no interest in progressing either truth-telling or treaty. Honouring all three parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is vital to redressing deep generational injustices that still impact First Nations people and communities. If the government is serious about providing justice for First Nations people, if the Prime Minister is genuine in what he claims is his desire to work respectfully with Indigenous Australians to close the gap in justice outcomes, he should start by honouring rather than trashing the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:17</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise in this House and speak on the Closing the Gap Commonwealth implementation plan. As I'm sure many speakers, already, in their contributions tonight have acknowledged, much work has been done but much work still needs to be done. I want to take this opportunity tonight to not only speak about some of the terrific work that's being done locally in my electorate of Forde but, at the same time, acknowledge that in our regional and remote communities there are some very, very difficult problems being faced in those communities that are not necessarily reflected in my local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are still many difficulties and many problems, whether it is in the youth justice system and engaging with the justice system; whether it is in the education system and being fully engaged in education; whether it is the opportunity to gain stable, secure long-term employment that provides the opportunity to build wealth, build families, build self-confidence or whether it's the opportunity to get appropriate housing. All of these issues still exist in my community of Forde and that's why I'm so pleased with the focus of the Closing the Gap, which is not only really starting to target these issues but, more importantly, is engaging with the Indigenous community in how we solve those problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that regard, at this point I would like to single out the work of the Beenleigh Housing and Development Company, led by CEO, Will Davis. They've been working for a number of years to develop a community-led housing project, and I fully support that project. I'd also like to thank Minister Wyatt for his willingness to look at that proposal to build a housing project that is designed to meet the needs of our local Indigenous community. Sadly, it probably won't be located in my electorate of Forde, but it will be located in the electorate of my good friend the member for Wright's electorate, probably down around Jimboomba or somewhere in that area. Our communities that we represent, whether it's the Yugambeh people in the south of my electorate, who also go into the electorate of the member for Wright, or the Yuggera to the north, are very much engaged in the discussion about how we resolve these issues for their communities. They include people like Uncle Ted Williams and Aunty Robyn Williams, both descendants of Bilin Bilin, who is frequently referred to as the King of the Logan and Albert rivers. I also reflect on the recent 50th anniversary of Senator Neville Bonner, who was a Yuggera man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that these communities have a rich history on which to build. If you have a look at the stories that are told through the Spirits of the Red Sand production at the Beenleigh Historical Village, you start to get a better understanding of the history of the interaction between the Yugambeh people and the original German settlers, and later, more broadly, English and European settlers. Sadly, there are stories that you hear from many places around Australia of massacres and people being treated extremely poorly. Even the story of the Spirits of the Red Sand tells us some of the things that happened to that community over that time. But, equally, it tells a story of the successes and integration of those communities, and at the end celebrates the success of where all of our communities have come from as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the important things in the Closing the Gap Implementation Plan was a focus on language. I think language is particularly important because it helps you to understand where you've come from. It is a vital part of culture, because it allows you to keep the history of your culture alive by understanding and keeping the language alive. Rory O'Connor, the son of Aunty Patricia O'Connor, one of the Yugambeh elders, wrote a book: <span style="font-style:italic;">Walan ya Nimbulima—Back From Lost</span>. It's about ensuring the survival of the Yugambeh language, and that it doesn't just survive but thrives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge some of the work being done at our local schools to do exactly that. At Beenleigh State High School, they have an Indigenous support unit, called Mibunn Jinndi, where they provide support for Indigenous students throughout the Beenleigh community. Eagleby South State School have a proud, strong focus on outcomes for Indigenous students, but a key part of that is ensuring they understand the language to acknowledge and respect their identity and their culture. Waterford West State School, my old state school, has a Yugambeh language program that provides students with the opportunity to see language as a means of real communication rather than simply as an object of study.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Marsden State High School, the Indigenous support unit, Deadly @ Marsden, supports the Indigenous students at Marsden State High School through mentoring, tutoring and connecting with external organisations and activities such as education support; social, emotional and cultural wellbeing; health checks through the Deadly Choices program; Indigenous camps; Beyond the Broncos; and an extraordinarily good rugby league and football program. Part of a recent discussion that I've had with Marsden State High School is to engage with Adam Sarota and Jade North, who have both played for the Brisbane Roar Football Club but who now have their own Indigenous business doing landscaping and construction, as a way to get kids at Marsden State High School engaged in the workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these practical measures that are being undertaken by our community in Forde are a practical demonstration of the fact that our community wants to help itself to be better and to resolve the problems that it faces—and they acknowledge those problems. But equally important was the funding that this government provided to Beenleigh Housing and Development Company—I think it was three years ago now—which has been very successful in allowing them to run mentoring and youth programs, and a range of other programs, to start to deal with some of these issues at the coalface.</span>

I commit to continuing to work with you through the implementation plan and other measures, to helping to continue to resolve the issues that you face in our community and to ensuring that the Indigenous youth of the community of Forde have the opportunity to realise their potential, just like everyone else.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  More than a year after the new Closing the Gap agreement was signed, this delayed report brings us grim news. First Nations people are still far more likely to be jailed, to die by suicide and to have their children removed than non-Indigenous Australians. Out of the 17 targets that have been set, only three are on track to be reached. In the Northern Territory we live proudly side by side with more than 60,000 years of culture, heritage and connection to country. We celebrate our First Nations' cultures and stories, but we also have a front-row seat to our nation's failure to progress on closing the gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government's announcement of a new $378 million redress scheme for people forcibly removed from their families as children. This is good news for my electorate, where stolen generation members have been fighting for compensation for decades. I'm thinking of those who were abused at the Retta Dixon Home in Darwin, and I thank all those who have fought for their compensation and for so many thousands of others across the NT who suffered in many different institutions and who have been fighting for so long to be recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to survivors like Eileen Cummings from the Northern Territory Stolen Generations Aboriginal Corporation. Eileen does not claim to speak for all survivors, but her words do tell a story. In 1948, when she was just four, she was taken off the Arnhem Land cattle station that she lived on and where her mother was a domestic servant. She didn't see her mother again for almost a decade and, shamefully, her story is all too common. Nationally, it's estimated that as many as one in three Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families under government policies from 1910 to 1970. Eileen said she was overjoyed to learn of the compensation scheme for survivors who were under 18 years of age when they were taken. Eileen said today: 'We've been fighting for such a long time. You keep asking us for reconciliation. How can we reconcile when the history of this country is denying these stolen children? If you want us to reconcile you have to take ownership of that injustice.' Eileen said of the compensation amount: 'Some say the money is not enough. But I don't care if it's not enough, it's something. To me it's taking responsibility and saying that something happened to us, and that's what I wanted all along.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eileen was planning to retire from the Northern Territory Stolen Generations Aboriginal Corporation committee in November, but says she will keep going until the money is paid out. She's worried the payments won't begin until March next year and that more survivors, like countless before them, might die before they and their families are compensated. She said: 'I'm fighting for the deceased and their children. They've waited so long, why do they have to wait even longer?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to echo what Eileen Cummings is saying. It is representative of so many members of the stolen generation who were forcibly taken from their families. Again, I welcome the government's move to announce this funding to provide compensation to those NT members of the stolen generation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  [by video link] My electorate of Fraser has been hard hit by COVID. Victoria is now in its sixth lockdown. These lockdowns have been necessary, but they have hit small and medium-sized businesses across Fraser hard. They have reduced the income of many casual and insecure workers, adversely affecting both them and their families. They have disrupted the education of students—those just starting prep all the way through to those trying to complete year 12. And, of course, too many residents of my community have also had firsthand experience of a family member or a friend getting sick or dying of COVID. In Fraser and in Melbourne's west more broadly, COVID isn't an abstract concept that only happens to people overseas. Fraser residents know the damage it causes and why vaccines are so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the ordeals endured in 2020, we ask ourselves: why has Victoria experienced six lockdowns? There are two reasons, and they are same two reasons that more than half of Australia is currently in lockdown. First, the Scott Morrison government has failed to put in place an effective quarantine system. Even after warnings, the Halton report in 2020 and many international reports pointing out that hotel quarantine is not fit for purpose, this government has not invested in quarantine facilities. It has relied upon state governments for proposals and has been completely reactive. Australia has experienced over 25 breaches of hotel quarantine. It is a system that is a not fit for purpose. These breaches have cause outbreaks and necessitated lockdowns. The other main reason, of course, is that Australia has one of the slowest vaccination rollouts in the OECD. Our lockdowns are more severe and more lengthy than they need to have been. These lockdowns are costing around $300 million per day across the country, as well as taking an incalculable human toll.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as much as it's important to point out the dire state of this government's performance, it's also important for me to point out that the people of Fraser have so much to be hopeful about when we do get through this pandemic. Labor has a plan to rebuild our country and our economy and to invest in our society. Firstly, I want to point to the Melbourne Airport Rail link. Fraser is located in the heart of the fastest growing region in Australia. It is close to the CBD, Melbourne Airport and regional Victoria. Improving our connectivity will be crucial to delivering the jobs and the growth that we need. Fraser will benefit from the massive investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail link. The Melbourne Airport Rail link is a-once-in-a-generation opportunity—an incredible infrastructure project that will provide transport opportunities for local residents to get to the CBD, the airport and other parts of Melbourne and regional Victoria. It will also be a catalyst for economic development, making precincts across my electorate a more attractive place to live in, work in and visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm keen to work with all three levels of government and with community stakeholders to ensure that the community gets the most out of the incredible opportunity of this major project. I've spoken with many residents about this project, in regard to both what they are excited about and also some of their concerns. Now is the time for individuals and community groups to come forward and add their ideas and input to make sure that this project delivers in the right way for our community. This project is a golden chance for the Albion area. We need to ensure that the station and the area around it are improved and that the area provides as much amenity for the local community as possible. It is critical that the federal government listens to the concerns and suggestions of the local community. The investments of the MARL can also help to realise the potential of the Sunshine precinct as a hub for jobs, education, training and health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to point out that, in relation to health, the Andrews government has delivered so much when it comes to health in my electorate and its surrounds over the last six years. This includes the brand-new Joan Kirner Women's and Children's Hospital and substantial investment in Sunshine Hospital. Of course, it is also building brand-new general hospitals at Footscray and Melton. Three new hospitals for one health authority is a remarkable achievement, indeed—and a transformative set of projects for Melbourne's west. This is a sign of what we as a federal government would do, working hand in glove with a pro-healthcare state government, when elected. With the Andrews government, we would build on these substantial existing achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Fraser are doing it tough, but I'm confident that we will defeat this delta outbreak. And, just as importantly, I'm confident that an Albanese government will invest in Fraser and ensure that families, workers, students and those in the healthcare services will all get more opportunities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I'd like to update the House on a significant business that's in my electorate of Parkes, at Narrabri. The business is called Australian Recycled Plastics, and it was started by Dale and Helen Smith back in 2013. Dale and Helen are very successful farmers in the Wee Waa area. They also have a significant trucking company that largely carts cotton to port on behalf of the growers of the Namoi Valley. Dale and Helen recognised that there was a need to establish a new industry, not only for the security of their own family and their own business but also to take advantage of the significant opportunities of recycling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I happened to be there last week to talk to them about a grant that they received through the Recycling Modernisation Fund, a bit over $2 million, to go towards an update of their plant that will enable them to simultaneously separate PET and HDPE, which will help that facility to actually reach its potential of 9,300 tonnes per annum. Dale Smith was telling me that the emphasis on recycling and return and earn in New South Wales in particular have improved the quality of the plastics coming through to their plant, but there is still an issue with having to compete with an overseas market. They are struggling at the moment with COVID and the fact that some of this material is making its way overseas. Now, legislation will change that, I think, following the decision that was made that Australia will recycle all its own product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's significant about where the Smiths are at Narrabri is that their factory is adjacent to the proposed Inland Rail, quite near where the Narrabri Shire Council intends to build their inland port. Also, probably more importantly, the proposed Santos gas field, which is right on the edge of Narrabri, would provide a source of energy into that plant. What they are doing now, after breaking down the recyclable material, is selling that shredded material or chip material to others to configure. With the advent of gas, they would be able to do a lot of that themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the expenses of recycling is freight. It's bulky but not particularly heavy. So the Inland Rail, which for the first time connects every capital in this country by rail, has the potential not only to help grow their business but also to make Narrabri probably the largest plastic-recycling area in the country. So it is a very, very exciting time. I've got great admiration for people like the Smiths, who see an opportunity, take a risk, invest, work hard, employ local people and actually succeed. I was pleased that Minister Ley was able to support them, through that modernisation fund, so that they can reach their full potential. It wasn't long ago—people in this House would remember—that pretty well all our recyclable materials were sent overseas. Not only was that an expense; it was an opportunity lost for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that we are becoming more conscious of reusing materials. The recycling industry is an important one. I believe that the drive and innovation shown by Dale and Helen Smith at Narrabri is leading the way in what can be achieved in a regional centre. You don't have to be in a capital city to run a nationally important business. They've shown that. I'm pleased that this government is able to support them to grow their business for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  [by video link] Right now Australians across this country and in our electorate of McEwen are fed up. We've been plunged into uncertainty and disruption because of a non-existent federal quarantine system and a slow vaccine rollout. The economy is bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars a day and billions of dollars each week because this Prime Minister hasn't done his job. He didn't get the vaccines. He hasn't built the quarantine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're the last in the developed world when it comes to having our population fully vaccinated. There are still people in the vulnerable priority category yet to be vaccinated. The delta variant is racing through this country, and everyday Australians are bearing the burden of a government that has left them behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strength and resilience of everyday Australians in our capacity to meet hardships head-on is what has defined us and is what will continue to define us as we navigate this long, hard road out of the pandemic. At a time when our federal government is shirking its responsibility to our nation, I look to our electorate of McEwen and the stories of everyday people and their contributions to community and country for leadership and strength. I'd like to share a couple of those stories with the House today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the absence of leadership and compassion that you've seen from the Morrison government in this chamber, we can still look to the great people in our communities to be reminded of the spirit and courage that we all possess. Firstly, on working together: it was a real privilege in 2019, along with our shadow minister Linda Burney, to meet with the Whittlesea Reconciliation Group to discuss plans for an Aboriginal gathering place within the community of Whittlesea, which would act as a means for education and the capacity to develop deeper cultural connections between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. I'm pleased to report to the House that, in the last few weeks, the plan for the meeting place has been approved by council. The Whittlesea Reconciliation Group is a source of great pride in our community as people come together with the goal of fostering a stronger and more respectful nation. Projects like these are part of what makes our community so great and so strong. It's the desire of every Australian to promote reconciliation which moves us forward as a nation. I'm very proud to see this work being done in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another story that gives me immense pride is in our community is the story of Kilmore local Brian Hardy. It's one of life's greatest honours to be able to call Brian a friend. Over a long career in the Victorian police force, which saw him rise to the rank of superintendent and running the Police Association of Victoria, Brian challenged the status quo with his trademark courage and persistence. He sought to keep young offenders out of prison, and he strived throughout his career to find social and cultural solutions to conflict as opposed to legal ones. Brian's emphasis on the positive role of policing within the communities and on the importance of welfare for police officers was well ahead of his time, and he's faced a lot of opposition in his attempts to reform institutions in desperate need of change. Despite the obstacles he faced, Brian's legacy is how he worked to create safer and more secure communities and pave the way for many of the policing structures and services that we take for granted today. It was a privilege to join with Brian's friends and former colleagues at a lunch at Hogans Hotel in Wallan to celebrate the writing of Brian's much-awaited autobiography.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over in Romsey, there is another story of service and commitment. Veteran Romsey-Lancefield RSL member Tom Murphy was recently granted the RSL's highest individual award, the Victoria service medal, recognising 57 years of service to the community. Tom became an RSL member in 1964 after serving in the Australian Army. In the RSL, Tom has acted as welfare officer and sub-branch president and was recognised with life membership of the RSL in 2017. The Meritorious Service Medal is a testament to Tom's enduring service to our community, as is his work with the RSL spanning more than half a century. He has helped countless Australian veterans and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In times as uncertain as these, when the problems that we face feel insurmountable, it's stories like these that remind me of the strength and courage of everyday Australians and it's our enduring spirit as a country. My hope is that these stories will serve as a reminder of the good things that we are capable of. In the absence of the compassionate and competent government in Australia that we deserve, we as individuals, as communities and as a nation still have the capacity to rise to the challenges that confront us and to overcome them by working together. It's so important that in these difficult times we look for positivity when people are feeling stressed and under pressure because of the lockdowns that are the direct result of the failure of this Prime Minister, this health minister and this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I'd like to start with acknowledging the former Leader of the Nationals, Michael McCormack, and the work that he and David Littleproud have put into generating what is going to be known as an agricultural visa for the agricultural sector. Right now the agricultural industry is on a pathway towards its target of being a $100 billion industry by 2030. Everyone is very proud of the fact that we have this amazing agricultural sector right here in Australia. We are very proud that we can produce enough food to feed 75 million people, even though we have a population of just over 25 million. We're very proud that, in the middle of a pandemic, the one thing we're not worried about is our ability to feed ourselves. The supermarket shelves remarkably keep getting topped up every night with fantastic Australian produce being delivered by Australian truckies in Australian packaging. The sovereignty we have built within our nation based around our agricultural sector is very reassuring for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is one significant problem, and that is the agricultural sector's inability to get the workers they need across the various sectors and across the different commodities. This is highlighted in the inability of Australians to want to get off the couch and go to pick fruit. We've understood that for many, many years, and that shortage still exists. It's gone much further than that now. We have a demand in dairy, we have a demand in broadacre farming and then we have a demand in the associated industries, the meat processors and the timber workers. When it comes to forestry, we're having trouble recruiting timber workers for the sawmills. We have this inherent need that has to be addressed. Like most other First World countries around the world, we have to rely on developing countries to provide us with a lot of the labour we need. I know our opponents from the Labor Party don't like this, but it's a harsh reality that, if we're going to take our agricultural sector forward, we are going to have to develop an agricultural visa to give our agricultural sector the workers they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have state governments that acknowledge the need, but in their time of need—and this was seen at a time of action last year—simply refuse to move on the health orders and the quarantine that they want to put in place. Effectively Victoria was locked out of the overseas worker market last year, and the ensuing damage with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of produce simply falling on the ground was the result of Daniel Andrews's inability to move when it came to bringing people to this country to help with agriculture. They could bring people in to get the Australian Open played—they could bring in the tennis players and their entourages—but they couldn't bring in workers, even though there was a hard promise from all these workers that they would receive a vaccination in country before coming over. They were happy to quarantine, happy to get tested, work on farm, live on farm, but effectively that state government didn't get on board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a chance that in a short while Australia will have its own agricultural visa, with workers coming in from a range of countries. What's going to be critical then is that we offer some of these great workers an opportunity to have permanent residence in Australia. We need a pathway to permanency that will let our farmers identify these red-hot, fantastic workers and offer them a future on their farm. Then we're going to need the opportunity to capitalise on some of these fantastic workers that have the ability to use incredibly expensive equipment, which is one thing that gets left out of looking at this whole agricultural visa debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you go onto a modern farm now, the technology that you see is just staggering. The machinery is getting towards being worth close to millions of dollars; it is in the high hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are headers, tractors, spreaders, harvesters. It is incredible. We need high-quality workers to be able to manage those farms. That's what we are putting in place together. As Minister Littleproud continues to work through this, we will hopefully be able to avoid the disaster that we had last year, where, when the need was identified, it simply wasn't acted upon on. We had this horrible spat between the state government and the federal government about who was responsible for quarantine. Well, the state has to put in place its own health orders.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I rise tonight to share the trials of a constituent in my electorate. Louise Whelan is 65 years old. She lives alone in a lakeside shack in Interlaken, a town in the Central Highlands, about two hours from Hobart. She's tough. She's as tough as they come. She's got a wicked sense of humour and she's whip smart. But, by and large, life has not gone her way. She's had reconstructive facial surgery following a car accident, and, in more recent years, she's experienced debilitating hip and knee pain. She can barely walk, let alone drive, and every day is agony. I've seen it firsthand. That's been her life for the past five years—five years of excruciating pain, five years on a hospital waiting list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May, it looked as though she'd finally made it: surgery booked in, all good to go. But the hospital did not clearly stipulate that she also needed to attend a pre-admission booking. At short notice, they apparently reckon they told her, but she never got the message. And she can barely move, let alone drive herself to hospital at the drop of a hat. She says she wasn't contacted, and, frankly, even if she had been, because of her immobility and how far away she lives she couldn't have got there anyway at the short notice the hospital says they gave her. So her surgery was cancelled—not once, but twice. Not once did the Royal Hobart Hospital offer to bring Louise to and from her pre-admission or her surgery. Not once did the hospital reach out to say, 'How can we help you get this surgery that you need?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my staff ended up driving a six-hour round trip just to make sure that Louise finally made it to and from her rescheduled pre-admission appointment. I'd like to thank my staff member, Lachie, who spent the entire day driving Louise and spending the day with her in the hospital as she did her rounds of appointments. It's not something that my staff and my office would normally do. It's not the role of a member of parliament or their staff to do that, but we knew that, if we didn't do it on this occasion, Louise would face many more months of waiting. Thank you, Lachie, for that, going above and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Louise is not a statistic. She's a person—a living, breathing person. There are so many more like her. Thousands of Tasmanians are spending years on surgery waiting lists for life-changing procedures and suddenly finding themselves back another two years or, worse, off the list entirely. In the past decade alone, elective surgery waiting lists have grown from 8½ thousand people in 2011 to 11½ thousand in May this year. Over that time, we've seen four restructures of the health service and more than a dozen reports, including a 2014 report that highlights the 'unacceptable number of overdue elective surgery', with hundreds of recommendations made and not acted upon. There is something deeply wrong with Tasmania's health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, we must also consider the implications of a federal government that is single-mindedly stripping our nation's health care for parts. The AMA, the Grattan Institute, health funds, Consumers Health Forum and the Australian Orthopaedic Association have all warned that the Prime Minister's Medicare cuts and changes will impact on fees and lead to an increase in out-of-pocket costs to patients. To top it off, we're seeing fewer medical practitioners in regional Australia. In the past month alone, my electorate has lost four GPs from across clinics in Brighton and Bridgewater—four!—and these are GPs with their books packed. Where are their patients going to go? More than 18,000 people live in the Brighton LGA, many with complex health requirements. Now they're facing month-long waits just to see an unfamiliar locum doctor, if one can be found. It's not good enough, and the state and federal Liberal governments have gone missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House know the importance of providing quality health care to regional Australians. That's why we've established, in the Senate, an inquiry into GP shortages and the rural health crisis facing our country—not just in Lyons but across our nation. Those outside city centres are finding it harder and harder to get access to a local GP, and almost impossible to find bulk-billing. We can do better. We must do better. This system needs to work better for people like Louise.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I don't often find myself agreeing with the member for Kennedy on much of anything, but recently something strange has occurred. I've found myself agreeing with him on an issue that he has recently shone light on. Since November last year, the Barron River Bridge at Kuranda has been reduced to one lane and has had significant load limits imposed. At the time, there was much speculation as to why this occurred overnight, without forewarning, given there weren't any works planned in the area. As time wore on, questions rightfully started getting asked, but, as is usual with this Queensland Labor government, no answers were forthcoming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It turns out Main Roads engineers were franticly checking the structure's safety and stability. As a result, a multimillion dollar investigation was launched, with the Queensland government promising to release the report once it was finalised. You don't need me to stand here and tell you what happened—or, in this case, what didn't happen. In fact, once the report was completed, the Queensland government had the hide to say it wouldn't release it because it would be too technical for people to understand. Meanwhile, engineers are hard at work checking more than a thousand individual welds and repairing them as they ensure the structure's safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took a right-of-information request by local media organisations to finally reveal the gravity of the situation. The document revealed that six years ago the engineers recommended replacing nuts and bolts on fixed and rocker bearings, as well as jacking up the structure to replace entire expansion joint bearings. The documents also revealed a recommendation to repair or replace corroded parts in a time frame no later than two years. More shockingly, the documents revealed that the retrofitted Macalloy bars used on the structure had been compromised through both pitting corrosion and the wear of the stressing bars vibrating against the girders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only were the Queensland government aware of the gravity of the situation for more than five years; shockingly, they did absolutely nothing to address it. Instead, they put the safety of hundreds of thousands of motorists who used the bridge during this time at risk and placed the economic viability of the entire region in jeopardy. I absolutely shudder when I think about what would have happened if the bridge had been closed permanently, given it is along a major freight route connecting the tablelands, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York with Cairns. It's now time to explore and invest in alternative routes to connect Cairns with the tablelands, such as the Bridle Track proposal. This time the Queensland government can't blame anyone else for their own incompetence and negligence. This is on them. The Queensland government need to cough up the cash to replace the bridge and reassure an already nervous community that the current bridge won't collapse into the Barron River.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the Kuranda Range, a major route in my electorate. I understand the newly formed Kuranda Range bypass committee has already held a few public forums on this important issue. I've always been a big supporter of finding a solution to the issue regarding the Kuranda Range. I have, on numerous occasions, approached the Queensland government on this issue. I've written on several occasions to the Queensland transport and main roads minister, Mark Bailey, urging him to consider solutions for the Kuranda Range. In fact, I have asked him to include the Kuranda Range as a road of strategic importance, given its vital role in connecting the tablelands with Cairns. To date, these approaches have fallen on deaf ears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the Queensland government is currently working on delivering an updated Kuranda Range business case, as the last one was undertaken more than two decades ago. This is long overdue. Pressure needs to be put firmly on the Queensland government to complete and release the business case in its entirety sooner rather than later. It can't be allowed to sit on the minister's desk or on a shelf in Brisbane collecting dust. Once this business case is completed and made public, then together, as a community, we can have an informed discussion and work towards delivering a solution on the Kuranda Range once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see that my good friend Scott Buchholz is here. He is the minister responsible for infrastructure in this area. I'm glad that you're here to listen to my contribution. It's something that desperately needs to be addressed. It's well and truly overdue. I'm confident the federal government will step up— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
