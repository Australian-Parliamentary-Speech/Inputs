         —Following on from last night, there are a few other remarks that I want to make. In the first bill, the Airports Bill, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) seeks to increase the membership of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. My understanding is that we are not opposed to that bill. One can only hope that his plans in that regard succeed.

         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          I would be most indebted to the honourable members for Lindsay and Macquarie—or, indeed, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron), who will be speaking later in this debate—if they could elucidate the details of how they were able to convince the minister to proceed with Holsworthy. Whilst I have made a few remarks about Holsworthy, I did not mention what a ridiculous nomination as a fall&amp;hyphen;back position it is. Holsworthy ran second last out of 10 possible sites.

        The shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), is here. He will know the difficulty of clearing ordnance and, if passengers do not get a bang from that, ANSTO is next door! I guess this is freedom of choice: a conventional bang or a nuclear bang, depending on your predilections.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The terrain around Holsworthy consists of ravines. It will be an interesting exercise, for either civilian or military engineers, to flatten the site to make it suitable for a runway. Then again, we do not want to run over the Olympic shooters who may be participating in the Sydney 2000 Olympics, of which I am sure all honourable members are very proud. Holsworthy has been nominated as part of the Sydney infrastructure for the Olympic Games.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said last night, should Holsworthy, in the most remarkable of circumstances, survive an EIS process, then an airport at Holsworthy is many years away. This would be a real breach of faith with the people of Australia, particularly the people of Sydney, concerning this government's intention to proceed with a second airport. I have suggested all along that, by nominating Holsworthy, you are really suggesting that the money that may be available from the sale of airports will be pocketed in consolidated revenue and none of it will be diverted towards building Sydney's second airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to sum up from a western suburbs perspective, and I note that the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is to make a significant contribution to the debate. The
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         thing that we are pleased about is that, as opposed to members opposite, we have stood up for our constituents and we have listened to them. We understand their concern about the EIS. Indeed, along with my colleagues, I was delighted when we announced an EIS process. I am happy to acknowledge—or I will be when I actually see the fine print of the guidelines—that the government should be congratulated for putting a go/no&amp;hyphen;go clause on it, but they have already missed their deadline.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have stood up for the people because there should be and can be no sale in advance of the completion of the EIS process. One might ask why this is important. I suppose, when we have a government that proposes to abolish the one authority that would be conducting an EIS, we should have some reservations about ever seeing the whole thing being completed. That is why we are moving the amendment. I invite members opposite to support the amendment that there should be no sale in advance of the EIS process. When I go back to my electorate, people are going to be pleased that we have stood so firmly on this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second thing we have said is that the infrastructure which caused such general favourable comment in the western suburbs and which was proposed to be built in conjunction with the airport should go ahead whether or not Badgerys Creek goes ahead. There is a significant difference of view on this between members of the government and members on this side. Nevertheless, I invite those members of the government who come from western Sydney—the members for Lindsay, Parramatta, Macquarie, and Macarthur (Mr Fahey) for that matter—to come across to this side and stand up for the people of western Sydney to ensure, no matter what happens, whether it is Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy, that that infrastructure is provided.

          would be a second airport built at Galston. Gough Whitlam said, `You will get Galston.' That was a decision taken in a moment of pique. It was a decision to put Sydney's second airport in a Liberal electorate. However, the process meant that Labor ultimately lost the seats of Parramatta and Mitchell because of a precipitous decision. It became impossible during the term of Gough Whitlam to make a decision on this issue.

         Major airport needs of Sydney

        was a study conducted over a period of time, and all sites were considered. Ultimately the Fraser government made the decision that a third runway at Mascot would meet the future needs of Sydney. On coming to office, the Australian Labor Party reluctantly agreed, despite the activities of the then members for Barton and Grayndler and other electorates, that the third runway should go ahead. They also sought a second site which was, in fact, a compromised decision. Basically, within the ranks of the Australian Labor Party, the decision was, `Well, you're going to cop it down in the seats of Barton and Grayndler and St George,' as it was in those days, `and you're going to cop it out in the west too.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Chifley mounted the argument that western Sydney was going to be devoid of job opportunities under the management of the Liberal Party and that an airport would be one way of supplying jobs to western Sydney. The fact of the matter is that all members on the other side of the House in the Australian Labor Party failed to mention the closure of Nirimba and other important institutions in western Sydney—so-called cost&amp;hyphen;cutting decisions by the Australian Labor Party that ripped the guts out of the economy of western Sydney. But then a pie in the sky when you die—the promise of Badgerys Creek—was something that was held out to the people of western Sydney as providing jobs. The whole process was pure sophistry and hypocrisy of the government of the day. It was procrastination at every step.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the government of the day went out of office with a decision to go ahead with Badgerys Creek. I will remind the House that
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that decision to go ahead with Badgerys Creek precluded any allocations for road links. There was no funding for rail links. It was a very poor proposition. There was even a time schedule published by the previous government of when certain tasks would be completed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There was a proposal that a complete environmental impact statement would begin at the start of this year and would be completed in July. That EIS was not even commenced under the Australian Labor Party. I questioned the minister and I questioned the House at that time, and not one person could provide me, right up to the day of the election, with any details of the environmental impact statements. There were statements published in the press. Ministers and members, prior to the election, failed to answer my questions about the environmental impact statement.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However I would remind the House that, coming into the election campaign, there was the announcement made that the bulldozers would roll on 30 March. The inquiry had not begun. There was no substance in any claims that there was an inquiry intended, yet the bulldozers were going to roll on 30 March for the construction of Badgerys Creek. So much for consideration, so much for the thought, so much for the care and the concern for the people of western Sydney by the Australian Labor Party. They were pure pawns in the process of what the Australian Labor Party wanted to do in western Sydney, which was, come hell or high water, build an airport at Badgerys Creek. They were afraid of losing face as a government and afraid of failing to provide for the needs of Sydney and Sydney's second airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Labor Party lost the election and today we see the beating of the chest and the claiming that all is wrong with the new government. The new government clearly went to the election with the people of western Sydney voting for the Liberal and National parties on the basis of the policies that they presented—some of which related to Sydney's second airport needs. Those policies, which were clearly enunciated across the west, were that there would be a full environmental
        <break page="1625" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         impact statement done of Badgerys Creek and that the people of western Sydney would be consulted in that process.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is something that the Labor Party never undertook. The Australian Labor Party failed at every step to acknowledge that that was necessary. They were prepared to rely on an environmental impact statement which was 12 years old. They were not prepared to make a commitment to a new study and then, reluctantly, the then minister said, `We'll do a half-baked, very minimal thing. We're going to fly Tiger Moths out of Badgerys Creek, and we'll do an environmental impact statement on the Tiger Moth proposition.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the other hand, the coalition said, `We will do a full environmental impact study based on the maximum use that could be made of Badgerys Creek. We will look at it as if it were to be an international airport, and we will see what impact that will have on the people of western Sydney.' The Labor Party during the election campaign took this firm commitment, an authentic commitment, to the people of western Sydney—and the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was one of them—by saying that an international airport was going to be built at Badgerys Creek.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They took the intention, stated so clearly time and again by shadow minister Prosser, that we would do an environmental study on the worst circumstances for Badgerys Creek. We were not going to dub them with some half-baked belated commitment to an environmental impact study. We were going to and will do a proper impact study based on maximum potential use for that airport whether it is the government's intention to go ahead and do that or not. We will not have the situation at some future stage where people in western Sydney say, `You lied to us. You misled us. You said you were going to fly Tiger Moths and now you are flying jumbos.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the way the Australian Labor Party operate in everything they do. They make a minimalist statement, get a conclusion and an acceptance and then suddenly blow out the costs, blow out the size. You lost your integrity and the trust of the Australian people because you were not honest and straightforward with them in the original proposition.
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         You can go through topic after topic, decision after decision of the Keating government and see the way in which the sophistry and hypocrisy of that government so loaded their decisions that people grew to mistrust them.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have been up front with this. We said we are going to have a full environmental impact statement, a full study done on western Sydney. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has said we are going to look not only at Badgerys Creek but also at the second proposition in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Major airport needs of Sydney
        </emphasis>
        , and the member knows that. Holsworthy came in second. It was the second proposition in the major airport needs of Sydney study. The documentation is there. You can wave the documents in the air but the propositions of the Australian Labor Party are as worthless as the paper they are written on. The people have rejected that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why do you think there are now Liberal members in Lindsay, where there was a 13.6 per cent swing? It is because you lost the trust of the people in that area. They did not trust you any longer. They did not believe you would do what you said you would do. So across western Sydney we saw a massive change in people's voting pattern, because the Australian Labor Party is no longer the party of the people of western Sydney. They can no longer retain trust because of the half&amp;hyphen;truths and minimalist statements. When they get a decision they suddenly blow it out and change it. That is the process that the hardworking families of western Sydney have rejected.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Now we are going to do a study of Holsworthy. We will do a study of Badgerys Creek and Sydney will get its best airport. When the minister has finished having the best and most efficient use made of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport, we will find there is adequate capacity for this process to go through and for a second airport to be constructed in good time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Labor Party did not look at what the best solution was but put a political reading on the process. They put a political reading on the process and then bent the facts to suit their political decision. The only way to make proper decisions in government or
        <break page="1626" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         anywhere else is to get the facts, start with the facts and explain to people why you can or cannot do something for political reasons. To do it the other way round is the reason you lost the election and the trust of the Australian people.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This issue is very clear. The government has been up&amp;hyphen;front and straightforward with the people of western Sydney, and no amount of skating around telling half&amp;hyphen;truths or presenting manipulated documentation will get the people of western Sydney to change their minds about the coalition government and the integrity of the decisions we have taken and will continue to take.

        There has been no announcement since then as to any change to these draft guidelines. So do not come into this House and tell these falsies about what they are or are not doing. It is not accurate.

        I must admit I had a certain feeling of deja vu when I started to read the second reading speech on this bill after the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) introduced it last week. It was a certain feeling of deja vu because I thought, `Where have I heard all this before?' Then I realised, `Wait a minute, that's right, it was one of our bills that we introduced when we were in government.' Then I started to read a bit further and I realised it may have been one of our bills but, as usual, when the government tries to take claim for anything, as when in opposition, they miss the shot, drop the ball and then move changes because they think they can make the bill better.

In fact, they reminded me of children playing that game Twister, when they do not know which way to go. They have to twist this way; they have to twist that way. I do not believe that the debate on the airports bills now before the House is a joke. The bills should be examined very carefully because of the ramifications not only for the people of today but also for the people of the future. That is also a consideration we should be giving as elected representatives in this House.

        Why, the government should ask, has the minister decided to drop from the previous bill the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules on leasing airports? They were a central part of our bill and dropping them will have dire consequences for the community at large. Gone is the proposed 15 per cent limit on cross&amp;hyphen;ownership of Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports with Tullamarine and Brisbane airports. But—read the

        It is very clear when you go through the bill why the minister has done this. He recognises the previous Labor government's argument that failing to sell Sydney airport first would result in a loss for the government. By getting rid of cross&amp;hyphen;ownership the minister is hoping to offset that shortfall. But it will not work.

        By failing to include Sydney airport in the first group of sales, the minister is virtually guaranteeing that bidders will lodge more conservative offers for other airports, keeping their cash in reserve for when Sydney airport comes on the market, if they want to bid at all. Investors, who at first might have received all the exposure they desired in the desperate world of airport management, may not even be interested by the time Sydney airport makes it to the auction block. When the process does not work, Australians will turn

        Further, the minister has given himself the power to exempt replacement airport master plans and environmental strategies from the public comment and consultation process. The government have been crowing about being the kings of the environmental impact statement. That is a nice one, Minister. It is deja vu. We are still seeing the government getting their airport facts incredibly wrong—so wrong that it stops being funny and starts to become painfully embarrassing.

        I cannot tell you how embarrassed I was on Monday to sit and listen to the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) who, not once but twice, rabbited on about her party's support for an environmental impact study at Badgerys Creek and how the Labor government would not have instigated such a study. She repeated that last night in the debate on this bill. I repeat for her benefit, and for the benefit of every other member on the government benches, that the date on this study is January 1996. I do not believe—I am sure you will correct me if I am wrong, Mr Speaker—that the member for Lindsay was even in the parliament in January 1996, but she achieved it all!

        I must admit that when I listened to the minister for transport's second reading speech on the airport bill I had a sense of amusement at first. I thought that he was starting to look a little frayed around the edges. Perhaps he was starting to realise that there was more to his job than cutting ribbons and turning sods of earth. He spoke about the bills currently before the House `substantially' matching those previously put forward by the Labor Party. He spoke about the `decisive' steps that the government had taken to resolve Sydney airport's noise problem. Correct me if I am wrong but, as a Sydneysider and a person who moves around her electorate and the city of Sydney generally, I would say that aircraft noise in Sydney at the moment is worse. It is certainly not better and I totally reject the minister's statement in that regard.

        With the changes to remove the Bennelong funnel, something like an extra 142,000 people are now affected by aircraft noise. Why did the government take such an inexplicable path of obstruction in blocking these bills before? They said that the first thing they were going to do was solve Sydney airport's noise problem and open the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. The minister has stood up proudly here saying, `We at least met that promise.' But what happened? When we were in government we did not think that submitting another 142,000 people to airport noise was distributing the noise equitably.

        There are a number of other points in this bill that I would like to bring forward.

Whatever side of government, these decisions are made without consultation. Whatever those opposite do—whether they try to change the cognate bills which we had already introduced into the House—they say, `Don't worry, we'll change everything tomor row.

        I have repeatedly wondered what has happened to the member for Hughes. After her election, she must have approached this House with much energy. She had been looking forward, as all of us had, to being a good representative herself for the people of Hughes—the people of her electorate. Now she has been caught up in a political game, and she is miles out of her depth. She has been exposed to that seedy, underhanded side of politics, courtesy of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and the Prime Minister. My guess is that she would now be extremely disappointed. I am sure that when she has the opportunity she will certainly be saying words like that.

        The member for Hughes is either kept in cotton wool in her office—I know that is not the case because I see her working very hard—or she has been instructed by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to keep silent. I can just imagine her saying, `But, Minister, I need to know so that I can talk to my electorate.' These are things we would all say, and it is only right that you say that. But why should you have been told at 8 p.m., the night before it was made public in this House and in this area, that a second EIS was going to be done in Holsworthy when groups in my electorate—because they had a meeting with Mr Wallace, the adviser to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development—were told weeks in advance that it was going to happen? Why were you denied that right?

        As the elected member of the Liberal Party representing the electorate of Hughes, why were you denied the information?

The minister couldn't see us, but we saw John Wallace and he told us that there is going to be another site under investigation. We came out knowing it was going to be Holsworthy.' Then we found out that the member for Hughes was not even consulted. That is what politics is all about. I believe
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        When we, the opposition, first discovered that Holsworthy was going to be considered, I, like everybody else, immediately read the second submission. The first one started in the early 1980s. Finally, after community consultation that went on for something like two to three years, the EIS for Badgerys Creek came out. Prior to that, there was a submission on possible airport sites for the future. As has been mentioned by previous speakers in this House, Holsworthy was certainly the ninth worst. That is why, at that particular time, it was dropped off.

        When we raise issues like this in debate, it is our duty to reveal to all Australians that the political ambitions of just a few govern the coalition on airport policy. People need to know that the government's plans for Sydney's airport future are not devised as a result of commonsense management and sensible process; they are arrived at only after a series of merciless power games. Australians—Sydneysiders in particular—need to know that the people involved in these slippery games are the same people presenting these bills before the House. They are the same people who will oversee the passage of this legislation. They are the same people who will control the leasing of our airports. We need to know whether we can trust this government on airports. Can we expect them to do the right thing? On their previous form to date, the answer has to be a resounding no.

The thing that really makes me shake my head—I do not know whether it is in delight or in disgust—is how the Minister for Transport and Regional Development can stand at the dispatch box day after day and, with mock solemnity, try to claw back the high moral ground.

That is what was planned and that is exactly what is occurring. That will bring relief for tens of thousands of Australians who have been subjected to all the noise, not 70 per cent or 80 per cent but 90 per cent of the noise, rendering their lives very hard to cope with.

         I now come to the bills themselves. I have a particularly strong interest in these bills. The former government, in its dying days in 1995, introduced similar bills with regard to the leasing of the airports. These bills would have seen the leasing of KSA and SWA with no restriction on infrastructure development. In other words, it was going to lease the airports, sell the lease and build right across the east-west runway. That would have meant that the east-west runway would never ever be considered as an option. That was what the people of Sydney were very angry about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         No mention was made in the former government's bill at the time of infrastructure development that would have gone right across the east-west runway. Fortunately, a change of government occurred. That allowed the coalition to set in train our policy on leasing of federal airports.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         was launched on 29 January 1996, which was, coincidentally, the day after the then Prime Minister called the election. It just so happened that that was the day the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister launched my campaign in the seat of Lowe. That launch was held at the Fivedock RSL Club. That was when our policy was launched.

         This is such an important issue in my electorate, as it is in a lot of other areas. I believe the launching of the policy destined the loss of Lowe which had to occur because the issue of aircraft noise played a very important part in that election. The people of Lowe, in particular the thousands of noise affected residents, read our policy and liked what they read. It gave them hope. We are now delivering on that promise. The policy document states:

         A tick for the minister. That was done within eight days of this government being sworn in, despite the fact that we said we would do it in 10 days. He was well ahead of time. The second condition is a very important one; that is, a genuine EIS on Sydney West airport. In fact, as honourable members know, the minister for transport has authorised an additional EIS, as an insurance, in the event that Badgerys Creek is not the right site. The minister has made it very clear in this House on many occasions when the matter has been raised—it is worth repeating—that Badgerys Creek is and continues to be the preferred option for the government.

         There are three additional conditions placed, which I list. First, aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith airport are to be limited to 80 per hour. No such assurance was given by those opposite in their policy. The second additional condition is that the lessee of Kingsford Smith airport will not be allowed to undertake major infrastructure developments at KSA that would increase the runway capacity of the airport. Again, those guarantees were not included in the policy of the then government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Probably the most important of those three conditions is that the lessee will not be allowed to undertake developments that would prevent the full use of the east-west runway. The people of Sydney have learnt a great deal about aircraft noise and about aircraft movements. They have become experts in a very short period of time. They can see through anyone who is trying to pull the wool over their eyes. They saw through the former government. They realised that without the restrictions being placed on infrastructure development at KSA the lessees were going to build and expand and close off the east-west runway as an option forever. That makes three further ticks for the minister for transport.

         I turn now to some specific issues contained in the bills that bear highlighting. I am very concerned about the staff currently employed by the FAC. When I first read the bills I was
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          concerned about what was going to happen to the staff in the changeover. The opposition's policy document made no mention of the welfare of the staff. Those opposite claim to represent the workers, the less privileged in the workplace, but they said nothing about the welfare of the staff who are employed in the airport operations. I am very pleased that this bill makes provision to look after those staff. They will be able to transfer to the new airport lessee company without in any way being penalised or downgraded. In other words, in transferring to the new lessee, the airport based staff at the FAC will be able to enjoy the same terms and conditions as those which they currently enjoy.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to the provisions contained in the bill, further controls will be imposed upon the operators of the leased airports. I will detail five provisions in particular that will provide much needed safeguards to not only meet the requirements of the tourism, export and service industries but also protect the interests of the airport users and the local communities. Firstly, the CAA will continue their supervisory role, particularly with regard to standard setting and enforcement. Secondly, the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 will remain in place. Thirdly, the federal Department of Transport and Regional Development will continue their role in aviation security controls. Fourthly, the Commonwealth Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act remains in force. Fifthly, the ACCC will administer pricing controls for the airports.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is only one other issue I would like to address in the short period of time I have left to me, and that concerns the airport master plans. When those opposite were in government they made no provision for any long&amp;hyphen;term planning for Sydney airport and Sydney West airport. No business can operate efficiently and effectively without long-term planning. I am very pleased to see that mention is made in these bills for a master plan for Sydney airport and the new airport, whether it be at Badgerys Creek or elsewhere.

          any details now, but on a future occasion I will talk about the stress that they were placed under by the former Minister for Transport.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bills make it mandatory for each and every regulated airport operator to submit for the minister's approval all development plans and environmental strategies before implementation and, just as importantly, after community consultation. As I mentioned earlier, these bills require that operators provide 20&amp;hyphen;year long-term airport master plans; environmental impact assessments for all major developments, such as for the increased length of runways or terminal developments; and that they obtain approval for new buildings on airport sites.

The government's bill contains a proposal for the leasing of airports other than the Sydney airport and the possible Sydney West airport under the government's privatisation program. The government's proposals are similar to those contained in legislation introduced by the previous Labor government in 1995, except that the Labor government

        When in government, the Labor government commenced the noise insulation program for homes, schools and businesses under the north&amp;hyphen;south runways and committed an amount of $260 million to that task, which was raised by the noise amelioration levy imposed on domestic air travellers. Indeed, the allocation being spent during this current period, 1995&amp;hyphen;96, is $105 million. That is an increase of $76.6 million on the amount originally budgeted and it has extended the program to cover noise&amp;hyphen;affected areas in accordance with the world's best noise amelioration practices.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As already mentioned, the levy was imposed on jet aircraft using Sydney airport to recover the cost of the noise amelioration program. That has resulted in a levy of approximately $3.40 per jet aircraft passenger landing at Sydney airport. Legislation was introduced as part of the budget to give effect to the levy in 1995 and 1996 and, of the money which is being spent in the current allocation to which I have referred, the breakdown is: schools and colleges, $40 million; other institutions, $15 million; residences, $30 million; property acquisition, $15 million; and program management, $5 million.

        That is what the former Labor government did for the areas affected by the north&amp;hyphen;south runway. What has this government done to honour its promise to the people affected by the reopening of the east&amp;hyphen;west runway? Nothing—it has not offered one cent. The three&amp;hyphen;year program commenced by the Labor government is based on a system of first acquiring the worst affected properties under the 40 Australian Noise Exposure Forecast level and then moving out into the less affected areas in an analytical way. That

        On 28 May, I received a letter from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to the effect that it is expected that `an initial insulation program' will be able to be put under way in the second half of 1996. Frankly, I will be astonished if anything but a tokenistic attempt is made to insulate homes and schools in the worst affected areas of my electorate. Indeed, as I have mentioned, the government does not have the funds available—which were raised by the noise amelioration levy—to spend on insulating homes in my electorate, because the $260 million allocated by the Labor government has been totally committed to those projects already under way under the north&amp;hyphen;south flight paths.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's promise to extend the period of the noise amelioration levy will amount to nought. The reason is that the levy and the expenditure have been programmed to 1998. If the government says it is going to extend the period of that levy beyond 1998, it will then start raising money which can be spent on noise amelioration in my electorate of Barton. But what happens in the 2&amp;half; years until that period of time locks in? Without a special budgetary allocation, the government has no funds available to insulate homes and buildings and to compensate residents of my electorate, despite its boast of reopening the east&amp;hyphen;west runway within eight workings days of coming to office.

        To compensate people and insulate homes, schools and other buildings in my electorate it would effectively mean an increase of 59.4 per cent in the current noise amelioration levy, taking the average cost up to about $5.40 per passenger travelling on an aircraft or about $1,000 per passenger jet. The sum is not a trifle. If you talk about figures during the peak movement period, you are looking at anywhere between $50,000 and $80,000 per peak hour being sucked out of our tourist trade as a result of the noise amelioration program. That is an impost which will be aggravated if the government delivers the goods over its promise to residents in my electorate. That additional money will be

Yet despite flying planes over schools while kids are trying to learn, over the heads of those suffering illness and the elderly in nursing homes and hospitals, and again over the homes of families when parents are trying to put kids to bed of an evening, the government has not done one thing to honour its promise of 29 January to compensate families in Barton and provide noise insulation assistance.

In referring to some other communities, he is talking about communities other than those in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong and those falling under the north-south flight path. Further, the minister acknowledged that there will be no assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of these impacts.

         So much for the self-righteous boasts of this government of governing in the interests of all Australians. What happened to the interests of the residents of my electorate of Barton? They were overridden, ignored and eventually discarded by the government. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development stood up here yesterday preaching in self-righteous tones about the environmental impact statements that the government is putting in place for a second time at Badgerys Creek and the new environmental impact statement procedures for this ridiculous proposal at Holsworthy. Indeed, he criticised the former Labor government for an inadequate environmental impact statement prior to opening the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. That is blatant hypocrisy.

          The decision to reopen the east-west runway is one which cannot be justified on any sane or sensible grounds. It is dramatically affecting and decreasing the ability of the airport to cope with air traffic—hence, the fact that it can only operate during shoulder periods. I view with considerable alarm the minister's new directive that, as from 15 June, planes will be taking off from the western end of the east-west runway and at a point simultaneously landing from the south on the north-south runway.

        It is very seldom that a democratic government gets 10 years to implement a major infrastructure project. With the ebb and flow of the democratic process, the comings and goings of government, it is often difficult to maintain momentum on a project such as an airport. But let us not forget that the former government had 10 years since the draft EIS for Badgerys Creek was released in 1985 to do something about it. The previous speaker concluded with this admonition: when is a decision a decision; and when is this government going to get on with doing something about this problem?

        I would like to mention the contributions to this debate of a couple of previous speakers. The member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) spoke of the need for a spirit of consultation. He was critical of this government for its lack of consultation since coming into office. Also, I would like to refer to the comments of Holroyd City Council on the subject of consultation. In a letter that was sent to me by that council, the general manager, reflecting on the previous government's record on Badgerys Creek, states:

         The council believes that a royal commission should be held into the whole process of the public administration involved in the selection and development of the Badgerys Creek airport in view of the lack of public consultation and information made available to the people of western Sydney about flight paths, noise contours and height. The council is very concerned about the lack of public consultation and in particular delay in providing details of the flight paths for public comment originally scheduled for December 1995.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been impressed by the guts of members on the other side who have stood up to defend their government's position with such alacrity, but I suggest that if we went through the whole record of public administration by various governments since Federation we would have to go a long way before finding such a complete failure of leadership by any government. That failure of leadership was in part caused by the fact that the previous government had fouled its own nest. It had poisoned the community decision making environment within which it was then forced to act. I am referring to the process under which the EIS for the third runway at Kingsford Smith was undertaken. This began the process of alienation of the electorate in Sydney from the former government.

Reflecting on the EIS process for the third runway, the committee said that the process lacked evidence and there was an absence of any real independent input. The committee said it was concerned by the lack of any monitoring process concerning outcomes. The committee said that the EIS had used selective data to substantiate the claim that only 14 per cent of flights would be to the north and, wrapped up into one very telling sentence, the committee said that the EIS was in many respects `an advocate's document prepared to achieve a predetermined result'.

They can look forward to a genuine process of consultation and, more than anything else, they can look forward to a process which does not involve a predetermined outcome. We are saying to the community that we recognise that, 10 years after the original EIS, things have changed. I note the metropolitan air quality study, and I am very conscious that it states that the highest incidence of asthma in Sydney is in western Sydney.

         —I wish to make a number of remarks this morning about the government's airport bills which are before the House, particularly the legislation which proposes to lease a number of airports around the country. Before I get into the detail of the legislation before the House, I would like to express a few concerns about the government's recently announced decision to consider Holsworthy as an alternative site for Sydney's second international airport. A number of members have quite rightly made the point that they have been looking for a site for Sydney's second airport now for 40 or more years. Many governments have sought to grapple with the issue, and I think the closest opportunity Australia has ever had to lock in that site was the former government's decision to proceed with Badgerys Creek.

         I am a little bit confused at how quickly the government has latched on to the Holsworthy site as its alternative to Badgerys Creek. The reason I am a little bit confused as to why the government has decided to give serious consideration to Holsworthy is that, as I understand it, it was about second last on the list of 10 sites that was last considered in a formal process in 1985 and 1986. If I remember rightly, the last two sites—the two sites that were at the top of that list of consideration—were not Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy but Badgerys Creek and Wilton.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is currently using the argument that Sydney desperately needs a second site for our second international airport and that, as a result, he was not prepared to consider sites which would require acquisition of private land. He used that excuse as the reason why the government was not giving further consideration to Williamtown, Richmond or a series of other sites and that, because the site at Holsworthy was owned by the Department of Defence, the federal government, it naturally stood out as the reserve site after Badgerys Creek. That ignores the fact that Wilton was the alternate site for Badgerys Creek and that the land at Wilton is owned by the New South Wales government; it is not privately owned.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The so-called justification argument, which the Minister for Transport and Regional Development is using to suddenly pluck Holsworthy out from second last on the list and place it second highest on the list, simply falls down. I just find it hard to believe that, following a few private meetings between the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the then spokesman on aviation policy, Senator Parer, and some private developers in some meetings, we are unable to find out what arguments persuaded the Liberal Party to adopt Holsworthy as its secret second option for Sydney's second international airport. As days go by, I think the information will come out, and we will find out why the government has made this very strange decision to take the site that was second lowest on the list of 10 and place it second on the list for consideration as the airport site.

          The legislation which is before the House at the moment seeks to outline a process whereby we will move from having government owned airports to a series of airports which will be privately leased. The former government made a strong commitment towards moving in this direction, but under some very strict conditions. We wanted to make sure that there was competition in the ownership of the leases, and the way we sought to ensure that was to have a cross&amp;hyphen;ownership limit of only 15 per cent between people who might be investing in Sydney, Sydney West and the other major airports such as Melbourne and Brisbane. In that way we were trying to ensure that, even if we got a lower price, we were getting at least two major owners of airports in Australia providing some tension on prices and services that were offered to the community.

          This had strong support particularly from the people in Victoria because for a long time they believed, rightly or wrongly, that Tullamarine airport had not had as much money spent on it as they believed it deserved.

They believed that that would have resulted in additional capital funds being committed to Tullamarine, which would have improved facilities for visitors and the tourism industry in that state.

          Last night we had the quite amazing remarks made by the Victorian Premier. He has woken up to the fact that the government, having reopened the issue of where Sydney's second airport should be, has generated a great deal of difficulty for itself. Because the government has stated that Badgerys Creek is no longer the preferred site for Sydney's second airport—Badgerys Creek is no longer the site at which the second international airport is going to be built—the government can no longer proceed with the leasing of Sydney and Sydney West. The reason that is a difficulty is that the current government has advice from BZW stating that, unless you lease the biggest, the busiest and the most profitable airport—that is Kingsford Smith, obviously—you will end up getting a lower total price, a lower return to the taxpayer.

         <break page="1641" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          <para first-indent="16">
           My understanding is that BZW estimated that the taxpayer would be $200 million worse off if Melbourne, Brisbane and the others were leased before the biggest, the busiest and the most profitable airport was leased—and that is Sydney. The government argues that they have overcome that difficulty by abolishing the cross-ownership provisions and that, as a result, they will be able to allow people to bid now for Melbourne and Brisbane and that, at a later date, when they have made their decision about the second international airport for Sydney, the same people will be able to also bid for Sydney and Sydney West.

           This is the problem that Jeff Kennett sees with that proposal. Last night, at a National Farmers Federation function, he said:

           . . . if, as I hear, there is a potential that Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne might all be able to be sold to the one purchaser, then we are going to have no competition whatsoever and we are going to transfer a government monopoly, in terms of FAC, into a private monopoly situation. And if we're serious about agriculture and we're serious about transporting fresh food or manufactured products, then we've got to have among those airports a competitive environment. And it is just no value at all to any of us to see them sold off to one potential buyer.

          <para>
           That is the view of the second most important Liberal politician in Australia. The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, says that he does not want to simply transfer a government monopoly into a private monopoly because of the concern that the new private monopoly owner would, of course, maximise their company's profits by jacking up the cost of using airports.

           This will ultimately mean that people who want to transport freight and people who want to create jobs will be unable to do so because the prices charged will be too high and tourists who want to use the airports in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne will be slugged with higher air charges—higher ticket prices. That is why Jeff Kennett went on record last night stating that he opposes this Liberal government's abolition of those cross&amp;hyphen;ownership limits—the former Labor government's attempts to make sure that there are at

           We turn then to some of the arguments that have been put forward by those who seek to move towards looking at this alternative site at Holsworthy. Under the former government, as I mentioned, we had a commitment to build Badgerys Creek. Yes, we did have a commitment to make sure we went through a proper environmental impact statement—one that had proper community consultation and one that the member for Chifley (Mr Price), and other members who represent western Sydney, persuaded the previous government should be comprehensive and should investigate all of the issues that needed proper study. That would then have ensured that the owners or the lessees of Sydney West would have had very strict environmental conditions placed on them. That might have required additional capital expenditure at Badgerys Creek, but all of the effort put into developing Badgerys Creek would have been put to good use.

Also, another $60 million was allocated to upgrading Elizabeth Drive to four&amp;hyphen;lane arterial road standard, which would have been the access road to Badgerys Creek airport, the Sydney West international airport.

We will be watching very closely to see whether this government is cutting back the funding for upgrading the roads in western Sydney, which is not just going to help Sydney West airport but going to improve the whole of the road infrastructure in the western suburbs of Sydney. We also made a commitment with the New South Wales government to fund the design work for the rail link, and we also made a commitment to ensure that the New South Wales government and the federal government would meet the cost of that rail link.

           We should compare that with the position in which the government has now placed us where we do not even know whether Badgerys Creek is going to be the site for the second international airport for Sydney. We are almost back where we were throughout all of those 40 years of arguments about where the second site for Sydney's airport should be, and it is all because the Liberal Party is arguing that we have to desperately make a decision now.

           If we wait that long, then you can do as BZW recommended. You can lease Sydney first, as a result of which you will maximise the return for the taxpayer, and you can keep the cross-ownership rules and make Jeff Kennett happy. You can make sure that you can have at least two owners and provide some competition for people. In that way, if the government simply delayed the decision on the leasing of these airports until we finished the EIS process and we knew where the second international airport would be, you would be able to make sure that Sydney was the first cab off the rank.

           Of course, this will be the first occasion when the government has to make a choice between encouraging competition, getting the money from privatisation or a leasehold contract, and getting that money as soon as possible. This will not be the first occasion when the government is going to have to make this choice between getting the most competitive environment for an industry or getting the money as soon as it can. It is going to happen in Telstra and in many other areas. In the first test between competition and the money, this government fails. This government does not do what Jeff Kennett recommended and go for a competitive ownership regime to keep the prices low. This government votes for wanting the money as soon as possible before there is a decision on all of these issues.

I am a little bit confused as to why the way the regulations will work is not explained in the legislation that is before the House.

            That is going to be a crucial issue for the Australian tourism industry. The tourism industry know that ultimately they and the freight industry will be the ones paying the bills. They will be the ones paying the prices which are extracted by the lessees of the new airports. If you had at least two owners, there would be some guarantee to the tourism industry that there would be some tension on prices, that there would be some competition. But, under the proposal that is now before the parliament, the government is quite prepared to have one consortium own all of the major airports in Australia.

            Ultimately that means the freight industry and the people who travel, international and domestic tourists, will be those paying higher prices.

            One of the other areas that causes us to be concerned is the way that the Holsworthy proposal was kept secret during the election campaign. We know that there were secret meetings between the Prime Minister, the aviation spokesman, Senator Parer, and the developers. In response, the Prime Minister said, `Laurie Brereton's staff'—that is, the staff of the member for Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith—`were also briefed by the same developers, the same consortium.'

            Yes, they may have briefed the previous government, but the essential difference is that we rejected their proposal. We told them we thought Badgerys Creek was Sydney's preferred site for the second international airport. What did the Liberal and National parties say when the current Prime Minister and the aviation spokesman met them? They said that they would give it consideration. The Labor Party said it would reject it, but they said they would give it consideration.

            For all of these reasons we think there are real question marks over this.

The Holsworthy site has 60&amp;hyphen;metre ravines in it, which will cost a fortune to fill. The Holsworthy site has unexploded ordnance scattered all over it. There are also other difficulties with the Holsworthy site. They will have to relocate the existing Department of Defence facilities from Holsworthy.

For the life of me, I just do not understand why the government has chosen the second lowest site on the list of 10 rather than the second highest site, Wilton. On this side of the House we think that, having spent $150 million of taxpayers' money acquiring land in Badgerys Creek, this parliament and this government should remain committed to the Badgerys Creek proposal while at the same time conducting a full environmental impact statement that examines all these issues.

We do not believe that this legislation should be before the House until the EISs are completed.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware from the list, I have entered this debate only after hearing the sorts of contributions that have been made in this House on an issue which truly should be bipartisan. After 15 years, it would not be a bad idea if we actually gave New South Wales and, more importantly, Sydney a second airport. Maybe we should all be trying to get together to give it the best possible service that is available considering all the factors.

        It is just outrageous to think that the whole issue has been one of politics for the last 13 or 14 years. Unlike the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I have been here during that period and seen it all. I remember the day that Wal Fife, our then minister, came into the old House and made the commitment to build an additional runway at Sydney airport—not where it is now but in a position that on good advice we considered would create fewer difficulties for the people of Sydney. Immediately upon election, the Labor government knocked that on the head.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That was their choice, but what did they do about a solution? Nothing. They talked up this site. They talked up that site. They talked about Badgerys Creek. Eventually, we reached a situation where aircraft were stacked up over Sydney airport for up to half an hour and public pressure was such that they broke an election promise which resulted, amongst other things, in the resignation of one of their ministers and in their deciding to build the runway. They put it in the wrong place. They even put a hotel at the end of it just to make it a bit more difficult to get in there. But they did it, and it is too little too late.

         Instead of going to the experts and asking, `How do we now manage the corridors, the departures, the arrivals and everything?' they said, `Let's go to the world and see how others do it.' I will come back to this point. I landed at Hong Kong airport the other night and in the time that it took my plane to taxi to the terminal I heard three other aeroplanes land. Okay, I would not say that we exactly want what Hong Kong has at the moment in terms of public nuisance, but the point I make is there is so much expert opinion around the world.

         I have sat at Denver airport in Colorado and watched the snow ploughs go up and down between the landings. The world is there to help us on that issue. Managing the corridors, et cetera, was not their criteria. Their criteria for departures and arrivals seemed to be based on Laurie saying: `How much can I punish Liberal voters? How can I make sure the noise goes over only the Liberal electorates?' That is pretty silly.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course we should have continued to use the east-west runway. A near collision at Sydney basically had nothing to do with visibility or anything. I have had direct advice on that matter. The fact was that the captain of the plane that was landing saw the other plane coming up. He knew it was there, knew it was going to cross his runway, so he took control of the aircraft and said to his copilot, who was actually managing the landing, `I'm in control.' In other words, he said, `I will fly around.' The copilot forgot to take his hands away from the joystick sufficiently, and that created the problem. I know you try to protect yourself in those situations, and fortunately there was not a crash, but a new instruction came out as to how to manage these fly&amp;hyphen;by&amp;hyphen;wire aeroplanes so that did not happen again.

         Just because of a near miss, the entire process of giving Sydney a second airport was put on hold. The previous speaker, who was a minister, told us how much the former government had spent on Badgerys Creek. They bought some land and they budgeted some money. But they were always budgeting money that they did not spend. They were always selling something three budgets in a row and counting the revenue so they could
         <break page="1645" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          trumpet their deficit position. They never stopped doing that. But all they ever did in 13 years with respect to this matter was buy the land. And then they did not buy enough for a buffer zone. Everyone has rushed out there to buy land to be close to the airport—they always do, and then they complain about it.

         Now you are in opposition are you going to give Sydney another airport or are you going to give people a scare campaign? For goodness sake, let's settle down and ask ourselves a few questions about how we can resolve the problem.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I come from Western Australia and I do not know what we are worrying about. We have an airport that was well designed when we were a little town. I live 2&amp;half; minutes car drive from the domestic terminal. I am not inconvenienced by the airport at all because of the good design criteria in the first place. All the land is purchased for both ends of what will eventually be a parallel runway system, with an industrial zone at one end and a rural zone at the other. On the sides we have a residential zone. There is a maximum of public convenience and a minimum of public nuisance. I am not saying there is no nuisance—there is—but it is minimised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have such an opportunity at the moment. It appears that you have left Badgerys Creek too late to apply those two criteria. It is 40 miles from Sydney with no electric trains and no roads. It was an idea to have something a bit closer to Sydney so we started looking for options. Amongst those options is Holsworthy, a huge area of land, some hundreds or maybe thousands of hectares—I have only seen it on a map—which is very long in the direction in which the runways would operate.

        <para first-indent="16">
         But the opposition wants to tell us about unexploded ordnance. I drew that to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) and he drew it to the attention of the House yesterday. The electorate of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has a large ex&amp;hyphen;military firing range in its heartland, currently almost entirely covered with houses and business premises. A company with which I am associated owns one of those business premises. We have not been blown

         The reality is that the area was all cleaned up. I would not be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition gave the order for the clean&amp;hyphen;up when he was Minister for Defence. So why talk about it? People are living on top of a military range in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate. Of course it can be cleaned up. As the Minister for Defence quite properly told us, there is always a minor risk but, since it is considered reasonable to have people living on top of a military range in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition, why is there a scare campaign?

         If we put that matter aside, what other fundamental reasons are there to stop such a project? Is it the construction problem? There are some mountains and ravines but they are not all that big. If you drive up the Pacific Highway—an area known to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—you will see the cut and fill. That is just a construction task. If you have a hill here and a ravine there, you do not have to cart the dirt very far to fill the ravine.

         As I understand the two propositions—I am not arguing for either; I am just trying to put some fundamental issues before us—one, Holsworthy, already has basic transport infrastructure.

         When you build a new airport the total cost is not the only consideration. Badgerys Creek cost $150 million for the land—a big cost—but there is not enough land for an adequate buffer zone. We have the land at Holsworthy for nothing and we have an adequate buffer zone, from what I can see on the map. It depends where you locate the runways but, surely, if it costs a little more to locate the runways dead centre so that there is minimum inconvenience to the people at each end, we should spend the money and take that into account in the assessment. That is all we are doing. But when it comes to taking the assessment into account, and we add up the total cost, we add the convenience and nuisance factors because they are relevant. Why wouldn't you consider the site when in this modern day and age you can clean up the ordnance problem and do the necessary construction? It is only a matter of what it might cost as against the outcomes.

           My view is we should do our very best to inconvenience nobody. But, on the other hand, if we do not build another airport for Sydney, we can see what might happen to Sydney. Jeff Kennett has some worries about competition, but he must be laughing his head off when he compares what New South Wales is doing with Melbourne's well&amp;hyphen;located air port, which is basically available for 24&amp;hyphen;hour operation. History around the world—particularly in major American areas—shows that, where a particular airport was not speedily developed, another town has achieved massive growth and become the centre for business.

I congratulate the minister and do that without any great political emphasis. He stood up and said, `Badgerys Creek will proceed. There are now perceived problems with it, and I have heard them from members of the Labor Party. We don't want to wait until we're told it's no longer a goer and then have to start again.' He has put up Holsworthy. I do not know how many EISs we can have running concurrently, but he has certainly come up with an alternative. On the map, Holsworthy appears to be closer to Sydney with existing transport infrastructure. As somebody who knows a bit about earthmoving, I do not know that those difficulties are as big as have been posed. I will wait and see.

I know other members share concern about these changes to the previous government's bill.

Aircraft noise has become a problem for many residents, particularly with recent expansion of flying colleges for overseas pilots who do their circuit training over the residential area. There is nothing designed to drive people madder than circuit training. I get a lot of complaints and I am sure other members—particularly the member sitting opposite, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams)—do too.

        The airport's management proposes to expand the airport with a fourth runway which will take its capacity up to 500,000 movements per annum. That will spray those planes all over the surrounding suburbs. Not surprisingly, it has outraged residents who are experiencing adverse noise levels even at current capacity. The Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency assessed the FAC's environmental impact statement for the runway and made a number of observations, including:

        This is not just a problem for Jandakot; it is a problem as to how well noise impacts are tolerated by residents. CEPA went on to say:

        I have to say that the Federal Airports Corporation was very resistant to taking any account of residents' concerns and particularly to take the advice of CEPA. I am very worried by proposals that I hear emanating from
        <break page="1648" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the government that the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, CEPA, may well be disbanded so this sort of advice would not be available to local residents in the future.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As minister at the time, I obtained my own advice on the issue from the Australian Hearing Services in early 1985 because of that resistance by the Federal Airports Corporation. The Australian Hearing Services, too, raised serious concerns about shortcomings in previous studies and recommended, as CEPA had done, further survey and analysis. I would like to point out that the Federal Airports Corporation, I think it is fair to say, had a fairly poor relationship with local residents. That meant that any study it commissioned on its own behalf, as part of its own environmental obligations, was bound to be viewed with considerable scepticism.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I, too, along with residents, would have preferred an independently commissioned study of the noise impacts, especially with the proposed fourth runway, with residents' inputs to the design of that study to give the community much greater confidence in its findings. Frankly, they got to the point where they did not trust the corporation at all and were likely to view any of its findings with considerable scepticism.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, I was finally reassured that the terms of the FAC commissioned study and its findings would be closely scrutinised by the Department of Transport, CEPA and the Australian Hearing Services—an unfortunate outcome in lots of ways but a necessary one. At this point the social survey component of the study, which looks at the impact on residents as well as the measured noise levels, should be close to conclusion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the local member, although now in opposition, I will be making sure that those commitments are met. The problem has not, however, gone away. If we are going to abolish the need to do these sorts of surveys, we will be placing a great many people at risk, not just in the Sydney area but right around the country including my own electorate.

         government committed itself to a series of very practical measures to alleviate the noise impact, which we already know is substantial. That was to establish a weekend curfew on all training activities after dusk, to introduce a 9 p.m. curfew for circuit training flights on weekdays, to recommend against the development of the fourth runway because there were proposals for another runway in the northern suburbs of Perth, and to seek a report on the scope for removing noisy aircraft types from training activities. A lot of these aircraft have no muffling at all and they are extremely loud when flying at low altitude.

        The coalition appeared to make similar undertakings to residents—and I say `appeared' because it was not clear at all that it meant to follow them through—and the terms were very vague. It was designed just to win the election, the coalition thought—something it has done in other cases. At the same time, I now understand it was privately reassuring the Royal Aero Club and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association that it would not really be making any changes. So no doubt the coalition will renege on its promises to residents. The member for Canning (Mrs Johnston), the member for Tangney, in particular, and Senator Ian Campbell, who has been involved in this issue, will be very closely observed by me to see that they follow through with at least the spirit of their commitments in relation to the people who live near Jandakot airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I must say I am pleased that the state government, in its planning for a second general aviation airport in Perth, has finally agreed to establish a bipartisan ministerial task force to look at this issue to examine options for sites in the northern suburbs. This should ensure that the sorts of problems that are being encountered at Jandakot are not replicated elsewhere. I think that is absolutely critical. In the long term, it should also alleviate some of the traffic pressure at Jandakot.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think one of the problems with this whole debate about where to site airports is that the argument is often advanced that residents, particularly in the case of Jandakot, knew that the airport was there before they moved into
        <break page="1649" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the area and they were foolish to do so. Certainly they did know of the existence of the airport, but no&amp;hyphen;one could have predicted the very dramatic growth in the number of aircraft movements. There have been significant changes over and above just the simple increase in population and industry. There have been those big aircraft training schools. No-one understood, either, the significant change in the nature of the aircraft using the airport.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In any case, that is not an argument for not addressing the problem. People still have rights. They still deserve to have their amenities protected. Similarly, those affected have been labelled—sometimes, I must say, by the Federal Airports Corporation itself—as a noisy minority who want the airport closed. I have not found that to be their view. In my experience of the residents, they have recognised the value to the local economy of the 70 businesses and the hundreds of jobs associated with the airport. They just want a fair go. Again, calling them a noisy minority who moved there knowing the airport was there is no argument for failing to develop measures to ameliorate the noise impact on residential areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think in this area, as in others, there is always room for compromise and agreement. We need a decent good&amp;hyphen;neighbour policy from all of our airports around Australia. There is no real desire, as I have seen it, on the part of the Federal Airports Corporation, particularly in Perth, to consider the community interest and to develop a good&amp;hyphen;neighbour policy. They have basically tried to brush aside the concerns of the residents as unreasonable. Indeed, the FAC has resorted to issuing legal threats to residents on a number of occasions. You would have to say that has not been a stunning public relations success.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In my view, it is essential that the public interest—and that means proper consultation—is clearly enshrined in the legislation. The community will undoubtedly be the loser from any vague form of words in the legislation which does not safeguard the public interest in situations where you are seeing development such as at Jandakot, and where on occasions there is little goodwill. I think
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         all residents should be assured that this legislation contains provisions which mean the minister cannot unilaterally set aside the need for decent environmental impact statements. That would be a very retrograde step in my view.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That concludes the remarks I want to make on this issue. I have other reservations about this legislation, but I particularly wanted to draw attention to the fact that if we eliminate conditions which ensure residents' rights are protected then we are taking a very serious backward step. For that reason, I have grave reservations about the legislation.

         —I was not going to participate in this debate but, having heard the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I felt there was a need to respond to some of his comments and to echo some of the comments of my colleagues on this side. I am delighted that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) has come into the House.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The concern I have is in respect of the comments the member for O'Connor made regarding the choice of an alternative site to Badgerys Creek for examination through an EIS process. I accept that the new government of the day might maintain that the previous government's decision to choose Badgerys Creek as the site of Sydney's second airport was the appropriate one and that the former government acquired a lot of land there. Also, people knew about that decision, and their decisions about home ownership and about industrial development that occurred on land in the Badgerys Creek area have all been geared around that decision. I accept that that is the case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for O'Connor has said in this place—indeed, so has the minister—that it is still the preferred option that Badgerys be developed as Sydney's second airport. The thing that concerns me, though, as I have said privately to the minister and a number of other colleagues, is: why choose Holsworthy as another site for further examination?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The original EIS that was done on the choice of Sydney's second airport site occurred back in the early 1980s. I remember it
        <break page="1650" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         well. Why? Because there were two sites adjacent to the city of Wollongong and to the Illawarra region which were included in that original EIS and examined closely. One was Darkes Forest and the other was Wilton. In fact, after my election in December of 1984 I was a very strong and passionate advocate for Wilton being chosen as the site for Sydney's second airport. I did so because I thought the economic benefit that would come to a city like Wollongong and to our region of the Illawarra was substantial.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I recall that at the time I was a member of Wollongong City Council and that we had established a task force within that council. I chaired that task force—in my former life I was an urban and regional planner—with the view of promoting Wilton and trying to encourage the then government to accept Wilton as the site of the second Sydney airport. As history shows, it was not chosen.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The EIS process occurred. Variously the 10 sites were ranked and listed. Badgerys Creek was ultimately chosen and the rest were put in some sort of descending order based on the assessment through that EIS process. It is worth recording  again that, from memory, Holsworthy was second from the bottom. Even Wilton was higher on the list from that original EIS process in terms of a preferred site.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From discussions with former aviation ministers and ministers for transport, I think they too recognised that Wilton was a much better site than it was first given credit for. It happens to be in the middle of the Sydney water catchment area but, as I understand it, Holsworthy also is in the middle of a water catchment segment for Sydney. With today's technology, the advances in technology and the way in which buffer zones can be created and so on, I would have thought Wilton should have been one of the sites for re&amp;hyphen;examination if the honourable the minister decided to choose a second site for that. It should have been put on the list in front of Holsworthy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will argue that case now. I will put in a bid now, while the minister is here, for him to take Holsworthy off the list and put Wilton back on—for all the regional economic
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         benefits that would come to the Illawarra, for the fact that the land is in government ownership, albeit state government ownership. I would imagine that some sort of a deal might be done with the New South Wales government to acquire however much land is required for this. Everybody does a lot of deals on your side of the parliament these days, so I see no reason why another deal could not be done about that. In a very serious vein, Minister, I put to you that the economic benefits that would flow to the Illawarra for the choice of Wilton as the second Sydney airport site would be just enormous.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I know that there has been an argument about distance. I put that to one side. I remember that at the time, about 10 years ago, distance came up as an argument in respect of Wilton when we were looking at the EIS. With modern technology, with high&amp;hyphen;speed rapid transit lines that could be constructed and so on, I would imagine that that would dissipate as a problem. I also point out to the minister that a major freeway system is established now with the Wilton interchange—Commonwealth moneys have been invested in developing that—so that there are very fast road transport links from Wilton into the city. I also point out to the minister that the centre of the city of Sydney has now moved. I think in terms of population and geography Parramatta is just about the centre of the urban conurbation that is the city of Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We in Wollongong like to regard Sydney as our northern suburbs and will continue to do so. We would see that a second airport in Wilton which can service not only the industrial heartland of Australia—which is the Illawarra—but also the city of Sydney makes a lot of sense.

        I also say something to the minister about the tourism implications of the decision to reopen this Pandora's box that is the decision on Holsworthy.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Premier's comments, as reported this morning, were absolutely right: this is a piece of legislation which is anti-competitive and anti&amp;hyphen;Melbourne. I note that in the past we have had the Liberal Party describing the Keating government as a Sydney based government. Yet we have seen the Prime Minister move the prime ministerial residence to Sydney, and one of his first acts as Prime Minister has the potential to stifle Melbourne in terms of its tourism industry, its industry competitiveness and the like. I agree absolutely with the Premier. If we do not have appropriate cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions, as were provided in Labor's legislation, we risk having a public monopoly simply transferred to a private monopoly and Melbourne will miss out.

        It is all very well for Premier Kennett to complain now. What he, in fact, should have done last year and before, using his best endeavours, was to prevent the federal Liberal Party from blocking Labor's bill in the Senate. In my view, the removal of the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership restrictions radically changes this bill and makes it one which is very difficult to support. I believe that it needs to be amended in the way suggested by the member for Melbourne in his proposed amendment, and preferably amended in this House to make it more acceptable and very much more in the public interest than it presently is.

        The second issue I wish to raise concerns the future of Essendon airport. I am sure I am not Robinson Crusoe in wanting to raise this issue. I dare say that many of the private operators—the potential lessees—of the Tullamarine airport want to know what will happen at Essendon airport. More than that, my constituents in their thousands wish to know what the present government's intentions are in relation to Essendon airport in the light of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You may recall that the previous government had resolved to sell Essendon airport
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         and to redevelop the site. In my electorate there is great concern that, if this leasing arrangement were to go to Essendon airport as a going concern, it would lead to the abandonment of the curfew and the abandonment of other relevant restrictions that help make life bearable for residents who live around Essendon airport.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Presently, Essendon is a major loss&amp;hyphen;making operation. It seems to me that no private sector purchaser would want to run it as an airport unless they were able to get some of the present restrictions lifted and to increase its level of activity. Those sorts of things would have a very adverse effect on residents who live within the vicinity of Essendon airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my strong view that Essendon has a poor safety record and, for that reason alone, it should be redeveloped. Recently we have had the report of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation into the crash of a de Havilland Dove back in December of 1993. That report indicated the reasons for that crash but, regrettably, made no recommendations whatsoever which could give the public any confidence that such a crash might not recur. That crash was, in fact, the third serious crash involving Essendon airport since it became a general aviation airport following the transfer of larger craft to Tullamarine consequent upon the construction of Tullamarine airport.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A light plane crashed into the area west of the airport killing the members of the Gulle family. In 1986 an air ambulance crashed to the north of Essendon airport where all those aboard were killed, and it was a miracle that that plane happened to land in the only non-housing area surrounding the airport. Thirdly, we had the crash of a plane in 1993 in Gilbertson Street, Essendon, into five residential houses. Once again, it was a miracle that there was no loss of life.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Given that poor safety record and given the history of incidents and near misses, with large craft seeking to land at Essendon airport having mistaken that airport for Tullamarine, it certainly seems to me and local residents that Essendon airport operations should be relocated elsewhere and that site should be redeveloped.
       </para>
       <break page="1654" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact that we have this bill before the parliament means that many people will have an interest in knowing whether Essendon airport is to continue or not, and the decision about what sort of price they are going to pay for the lease on Tullamarine airport will no doubt be influenced by that. So they have a right to know as well.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In conclusion, I would stress my support for the amendment, which I believe is very much in Melbourne's best interests. If this government is fair dinkum about its commitment to Melbourne, it would retain those cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions and retain the prospect that we should have a lessee of Melbourne's Tullamarine airport who is truly committed to the welfare of that airport and truly committed to the welfare of Melbourne. Secondly, I seek from the minister some advice regarding his view of the future of Essendon airport in the light of this legislation.

        The second concern I have relates to Sydney West airport and the issue of the suitability of the Holsworthy site. The minister has said that he is using Holsworthy as an insurance policy. It is fair and reasonable for this House to ask: who is paying the premium for this minister's decision to use Holsworthy as a so-called insurance policy? The people who are paying the premium are the 500,000 residents in south-west Sydney—the people who are directly affected by this proposition. The people who are directly paying the premium for his insurance policy are those property owners in Wattle Grove, Holsworthy and Ingleburn, Minto and Macquarie Fields in my electorate who have had their properties devalued as a product of this decision. He is holding the insurance policy, but they are paying the premium. They are the residents who moved in in good faith, many of them as part of a federal government scheme through the Defence Housing Authority by which they could find their dream suburb and their dream lifestyle. They have had that dream turned into a nightmare by this minister's decision.

        Who else is paying the premium for the minister's insurance policy? The Department of Defence has had all its forward defence planning thrown in the air as a product of the uncertainty about the Holsworthy site. The Sydney 2000 Olympics is paying a premium for the minister's insurance policy. It has had its planning for the shooting range at Holsworthy thrown in the air as a product of this minister's determination to hold an insurance policy—a policy at no cost to himself and to the landed gentry in the Goulburn district but at a direct cost to land values and lifestyle aspirations in suburbs such as Holsworthy, Wattle Grove and east Liverpool in the electorate of Hughes and at a cost to land values in suburbs such as Ingleburn, Minto and Macquarie Fields in my electorate of Werriwa.

        I would suggest to the House that any sensible or reasonable person would conclude that this is an act of deceit whereby the coalition had been planning their Holsworthy option for a long time. They thought it was more important to talk to big business about this plan than the people in the south-west of Sydney. They thought it was more important to keep their plans secret than to have a charter of airport honesty—to be open, transparent and disclose their intentions to the 500,000 residents in the south-west of Sydney.

        When people talk about the Prime Minister, as they do quite frequently in the south-west of Sydney these days, they refer to Little Johnny Coward. Little Johnny Coward wouldn't reveal his plan before the election and held it secret. Only after the election did he decide to tell people in the south-west of Sydney that they would be affected by an EIS, their properties would lose value, their lifestyles would be thrown in the air, their expectations would be destroyed and they would have to pay the premium for the insurance policy that this minister and the Prime Minister hold with big business. It is a disgrace. It should not be happening. The government should amend this legislation to abandon the Holsworthy site as soon as possible. It is a farce.

         —I thank members of the House for participating in this debate, particularly those members from our side who have made contributions. It has been a very interesting debate. Whilst a debate like this is wide ranging and provides the opportunity for many members to discuss any issue relating to airports, there has been a particular focus on the government's decision of last week to do parallel environmental impact studies on both Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy, as we come to the resolution of a second airport for Sydney.

         The tenor of the debate of the Labor Party has been the government's decision to con sider Holsworthy as a second airport option for Sydney. I make the point—it is a very important point to make—that, in discussing that issue, as members of the Labor Party have throughout this debate, the first thing to remind ourselves of is the fact that Badgerys Creek is our first preference. The only reason we feel we have a need to look at a site other than Badgerys Creek when doing an environmental impact study is the failure of the previous Labor government to address the option of Badgerys Creek as the second airport for Sydney.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The history of this is very important. The previous government undertook an environmental impact study of a number of sites in 1985 and selected Badgerys Creek as their preferred site in February 1986. From February 1986 through to 1989, the government did nothing at Badgerys Creek. Then in 1989 the government announced that they would be having a staged development of Badgerys Creek airport which would see the airport operational by June of 1995.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What had happened by June 1995? Absolutely and utterly nothing. Not a sod had been turned, not a runway had been built and not a building had been constructed on the site that was supposed to be an operating airport by June 1995. Late in 1995, the former Minister for Transport announced that there would be no operational airport at Badgerys Creek until well beyond the year 2000.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the course of that 10&amp;hyphen;year delay, the environmental problems for Badgerys Creek have increased. We have seen an enormous encroachment of urban development around the Badgerys Creek airport site, particularly under potential flight paths for Badgerys Creek airport. That encroachment of housing in those areas has led to the loss of the unique opportunity that existed at Badgerys Creek in 1986; that is, Badgerys Creek was relatively untouched by urban development in and around the site and under the flight paths. The delay of the former Labor government in doing anything at Badgerys Creek has led to those environmental problems developing. It has caused us considerable difficulty as we look at solving Sydney's airport problems.

         It is worth noting that in the course of all of that the then government was unable to determine a rail link to Badgerys Creek airport. Indeed, it was unable to satisfactorily negotiate, until just recently, the establishment of a road link to Badgerys Creek airport. This former Labor government had 10 years to do all of the things that needed to be done in order to develop an airport at Badgerys Creek. They absolutely and utterly failed.

They did nothing. They fast&amp;hyphen;talked and slow&amp;hyphen;tracked. They talked up what they were going to do at Badgerys Creek and in reality did nothing.

         That problem is now the inheritance of the new coalition government. It is our determination to build a second airport in Sydney as quickly as possible. That is why we are doing what we are doing at the present time. If members opposite do not like what we are doing, then they might like to look back at their own history of government and blame themselves—I am sure most reasonable people would—for the delay of 10 years in doing something about Badgerys Creek airport.

         I refer to a number of the aspects of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). The amendment has been the subject of some discussion. I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne, following this stage, will be moving further amendments which relate to cross&amp;hyphen;ownership. I might take the opportunity during that debate to refer to those cross&amp;hyphen;ownership matters rather than deal with them now.

         The government welcomes the comments of the shadow minister and members of the Labor Party that they do not intend to oppose the bill as such. We note that they have some
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          amendments they wish to move. There is good reason why the Labor members of this parliament should not oppose this bill. Essentially, this bill that was introduced last week into the House is the same as, or very similar to, the bill that was put forward by the former Labor government last year.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have made some amendments to the original Labor government bill. One of those relates to the cross&amp;hyphen;ownership requirement, which I will refer to in later debate; the other relates to environmental and planning arrangements, which we believe we have enhanced and made less cumbersome. We have also ensured that a more pro&amp;hyphen;competitive regime applies to the airport to fit within the requirements of the Hilmer process and that in the long-term lease of these airports—as it is more accurately described—a very pro-competitive environment exists.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Those are the basic changes we have made. It is for that reason that it is sensible for Labor members of parliament, now in opposition, to support this bill. Essentially, it is the very same bill that they put forward when they were in government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I will refer particularly to the first item in the amendment, which reads:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         No sales should occur until all Environmental Impact Statement processes are completed and the future of Sydney West Airport is resolved;
        </para>
        <para>
         We are determined not to sell Sydney Mascot airport and Sydney West airport until such time as we have satisfactorily completed the environmental impact studies and decisions are made in relation to that. We will not be putting on the market Sydney Mascot and Sydney West airports until such time as we fulfil our election commitment, made by the former shadow minister for aviation, Senator Parer—and indeed reiterated by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), then opposition leader—that we will not do so until such time as we have been able to satisfactorily resolve Sydney's aircraft noise problems.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One has to be mindful of the fact, when we look at all of these amendments and the actions of the government in the last week, that they are all born out of a desire of this
         <break page="1658" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          government, the Liberal and National parties, to satisfactorily resolve the aircraft noise problem for the people of Sydney. There is no doubt in Sydneysiders' minds, and in the minds of the government, that the problems of Sydneysiders as a result of aircraft noise came about because of the mismanagement of the former Labor government in dealing with that aircraft noise problem. It has caused enormous anxiety and distress for Sydney people, and we are now left with that problem. We are trying to deal with it as best we can. One of the commitments we made in opposition that we are determined to fulfil in government is that we will ensure that we will not sell long&amp;hyphen;term leases for Mascot or Sydney West airports until we have in our minds satisfactorily resolved the aircraft noise problems of Sydney. I go to the second part of the amendment, which says:
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         ...in order to ensure that the Commonwealth achieves the maximum lease payments possible as a result of the processes set out in the Airports Bill and the Airports (Transitional) Bill, Sydney (Kingsford&amp;hyphen;Smith) Airport should be included in the first tranche of airports outlined in the Minister for Finance's second reading speech for the Airports (Transitional) Bill, rather than be offered for leasehold sale at some later time;
        </para>
        <para>
         All of us would support a proposal that would enhance the value of the airports that it is proposed will be sold by this legislation. I think every sensible member of parliament would say that that is a worthy goal because, at the end of the day, we want to achieve maximum value for the taxpayer. But there are differences of opinion. One of the opinions that I think predominates in the market at the moment is that it would be deleterious to the value of Sydney's airport if it were to be put up for sale at this present time without a satisfactory resolution of the question of a second airport for Sydney.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we would say that the best way to deal with this issue is to exclude Sydney's airport from the sale process at this time, deal with the second airport problem, deal with the aircraft noise problem—which is also a factor that impacts on the potential value of Sydney's airports—and, once you have dealt with those satisfactorily, then put them on the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          market and you will achieve the highest possible value for those airports when you put them up for sale. So we believe that that is the appropriate approach to achieve the goal of obtaining the highest value for Sydney's airports.

         The third aspect of the amendment put forward by the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) is the following:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         the road and other infrastructure developments associated with the Badgerys Creek proposal should proceed where appropriate, regardless of whether Sydney West Airport is built at Badgerys Creek.
        </para>
        <para>
         If you take the hypothetical situation and assume for a moment—but do not pretend that this is our intention—that Badgerys Creek airport does not proceed, it would be ridiculous to build the rail system to Badgerys Creek airport if it is not to exist. Yet the intent of the third aspect of the amendment would require us to build the rail line to Badgerys Creek airport even if we do not build an airport there. So we see that aspect of the amendment as contradictory and somewhat lacking in logic. It is for that reason we certainly cannot support that aspect of the amendment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I say to the House that the government is determined to put to the market as quickly as possible those airports that we have outlined in our speech. One thing that members of the Labor Party need to recognise is that there is a very strong view in the business community that any further unnecessary delays to the sale of those airports will have an impact on the value of those airports. Further uncertainty will impact on the value of those airports and therefore disadvantage the taxpayers of Australia by reducing the value of those airports. I think it is a view that members opposite would appreciate exists in the marketplace. So now is the time for us to proceed with the passage of this legislation as quickly as possible so that we can ensure that those airports that have been listed for sale can be presented to the market to receive offers to benefit the taxpayers of Australia.

         The amendments I have moved relate to the reinstatement of cross-ownership rules in the airports legislation. As the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) briefly pointed out beforehand, the legislation which has been introduced by the government with respect to the sale of airport leaseholds is essentially the same as the legislation that was introduced by the former Labor government. But probably the most important difference between the legislation that is before the House today and the legislation that our government introduced is that the cross-ownership rules—which, in effect, limited any one leaseholder to no greater than 15 per cent ownership of either both Sydney and Melbourne or both Sydney and Brisbane—have been deleted from the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition has a position on this issue which is consistent with what its position was when in government; namely, we do not want to see a private monopoly in airport administration replace the current public monopoly. Without the cross-ownership provisions, there is a serious risk that that is precisely what will occur.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I understand that—and perhaps the minister could clarify this when he comes to the dispatch box—the cross-ownership rules were in the original legislation that went to cabinet with the minister's recommendation. But when it came out of cabinet at the other end, as a result of the actions of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), they were not there any more.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Even Jeff Kennett last night, as has been illustrated by a couple of members, spoke out on this issue. I quote from his speech to the National Farmers Federation:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . one of my great fears, and it was a fear under the previous government and it's a fear under this in part, is what's going to happen with our airports, because if, as I hear, there is a potential that Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne might all be able to be sold to the one purchaser, then we are going to have no competition whatsoever and we are going to transfer a government monopoly, in terms of FAC, into a private monopoly situation.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         </break>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         And if we're serious about agriculture and we're serious about transporting fresh food or manufactured products, then we've got to have among those airports a competitive environment. And it is just no value at all to any of us to see them sold off to one potential buyer.
        </para>
        <para>
         I should mention that Mr Kennett actually has a fair bit of expertise about creating private monopolies out of public ones. He did that with the TAB in Victoria, for example, so it is slightly amusing to see him taking this line. However, I hasten to add that I agree 100 per cent with his point: we should be reinstating the cross-ownership rules in the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true that, by and large, airports do not compete; destinations do. But significant competition does occur at the margins, and this competition is, of course, relevant, particularly to the costs that are imposed on the users of freight services. Some of the examples that Mr Kennett cited in his speech to the National Farmers Federation are, in fact, very good examples of why we should be concerned about the absence of cross-ownership provisions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Without these provisions, we will not, or may not, have the basis for comparing different airports under different administrations to ensure that we get the maximum level of efficiency of operations in airports and the minimum degree of imposition of costs on both the direct users of airports, the airlines, and the indirect users, those people who fly with the airlines and those people who actually transport freight. The amendments I have moved simply reinstate the identical provisions in their entirety that were in the legislation previously presented to the House by the former Labor government. I commend those amendments to the House.

        Earlier on the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) said, `If Labor insists on this amendment and holds up the process, and if there are similar amendments in the Senate, it will create uncertainty.' He is a poacher now turned gamekeeper. He is the little boy who lit the fire who has now arrived with a red hat to put out the fire. The coalition caused all the uncertainty on these provisions because they signed up for the Lawrence Hargrave project which said at the end of last year, `You can't allow the

So the poacher is now parading himself in this place as the gamekeeper—the boy who lit the fire late last year has now turned up today with a little red hat because he is the fireman who is putting out the fire and saying, `Let's get these leasehold arrangements under way as soon as possible.'

It is rich to say that, after doing all that and just before the airport is to take off, somehow we are responsible for uncertainty because you want to take out your expensive insurance policy on Holsworthy.

We had the Badgerys Creek airport ready to take off but the certainty has been ripped away by your mad scheme to develop Holsworthy as an expensive insurance policy knowing that every single resident—500,000 people in the south&amp;hyphen;west of Sydney—has to pay the premium.

If it had not been for their doing nothing once they decided in February 1986 to build a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek, we would not be here today talking about this very issue.

        The problems he has highlighted today are born of the Labor government's failures. The amendments which we are dealing with today have been moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and they relate to two aspects. Cross&amp;hyphen;ownership is probably the principal aspect that he is concerned with,
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         which relates to amendments Nos 1 to 7 and 10. We received those amendments just a short while ago.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The government, in recognition of the excision of Sydney/Sydney West airports from the first set of sales, has not set down cross ownership provisions in the bill. Such restrictions could reduce the number of potential bidders for the first tranche airports.

       <para>
        I was referring there to the fact that in the bill moved by the former Labor government there were cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions designed to stop someone owning a Sydney airport and a Brisbane airport, or a Sydney airport and a Melbourne airport. We believe we have met the intent of those proposed cross&amp;hyphen;ownership provisions by our withdrawal from the first tranche of sales of Sydney and Sydney West airports.

        We will consider the other points raised by the amendments moved by the honourable member for Melbourne as this bill moves to the Senate.

Companies that are looking to investment in the major airports at Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are looking at massive investments where the decision to invest must be viewed in the overall context.

         The Federal Airports Corporation was established as the overall federal authority with a monopoly on the provision of a public utility right across the country. If you have investment in Sydney and Melbourne, you have the game by the throat because you have the resources, the market and the growth. All the other airports—in Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Alice Springs and Darwin—will hang from them.

It would seem from this airports legislation that the government intends to wreck the process of the sale of airports around Australia. It seems to have adopted the rather bizarre approach of putting up for sale a number of Commonwealth assets in airports worth varying amounts of money, while holding onto the jewel in the crown.

         It is too late for a second Sydney airport. This was pointed out by the opposition and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) from the government benches last night. Sydney has now developed to the west and south&amp;hyphen;west to such a degree that an airport would be a gross invasion into the lives of those populations, whether it be located at Badgerys Creek or at Holsworthy. Either location would also be an electoral disaster for whichever government located it there. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) can promise all the environmental impact studies he likes, but nothing is going to change this simple fact.

         The other problem is the fast approaching Olympics. This is distorting all fair judgment about a new airport for Sydney. A decision made with limited options could condemn Sydney to `airport syndrome' for the next 100 years. What is needed is a long&amp;hyphen;term visionary approach to our aviation requirements and to the development of transport infrastructure within Australia.

         One suggested option that has been revived in recent weeks is Goulburn. Whilst superficially attractive, this option probably can be ruled out because of fog. However, it deserves serious study. It has obvious merit and would be far cheaper than Sydney West. However, I believe the Parkes inland airport project is a far better option.

         Such a project could easily be expanded to an international passenger airport at substantially less cost than anything planned for Sydney. What is more, the land is as flat as the floor of this chamber. There is no unexploded ordnance. Landing and take&amp;hyphen;off patterns would cause minimum disruptions.

         After the Olympics, incoming passenger habits will return to normal; destinations of visitors will be substantially other than Sydney. How better to generate more business for our regional airline system than to have these operators hub and spoke to other capitals, such as Darwin and Alice Springs, out of Parkes. Are we afraid to be too visionary in this? How about a very fast train from Parkes to Sydney on which all necessary customs matters could be attended?

         What is the alternative? Here we have a government desperate to rake in revenue to balance the books. I agree that the government should be anxious about the situation, but not desperate. We must not go down the path of a Holsworthy, having abandoned the Badgerys Creek option, not because it fails the EIS but because, by any sensible judgment, it is not the place for an international airport.

         One&amp;hyphen;third of all traffic coming in and out of Kingsford Smith does not need to be there, it is using it as a hub. The proposed Sydney West airport will have a runway length of 2,900 metres, meaning it will not be able to take jumbo jets. As far as passenger needs go, it will only be able to operate as a secondary domestic airport. Five billion dollars is a lot to pay for a secondary domestic airport.

Given it is in the electorate of Parkes I understand that Mr Cobb, the National Party member for that seat, would probably welcome the minister agreeing to at least provide funding for a thorough and proper feasibility study. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, was quite impressed with the potential for that airport to become an airport for the export of vegetables and other Australian produce to Asia. I think at the very least the government could afford to fund a feasibility study for the measure.

        Another issue I would like the minister to respond to is the statement which was made last night by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, to the National Farmers Federation. Jeff Kennett said there was not much point in converting a government monopoly into a private monopoly and by implication was strongly supporting the former government's proposals to have cross&amp;hyphen;ownership restrictions between Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane. I hope that is an issue that the minister could give further consideration to given the powerful advocacy that Jeff Kennett, the Liberal Premier of Victoria, has put into this issue overnight.

        I will make one point on the substantive question of cross&amp;hyphen;ownership rules in response to what the minister has said. I find his suggestion that in some way they are no longer necessary because the sale of Sydney/Sydney West is going to be delayed rather bizarre because I do not quite see what would stop a Melbourne leaseholder or a Brisbane leaseholder or a Melbourne and Brisbane leaseholder from two or three years later or whenever then purchasing the leasehold with respect to Sydney and Sydney West when they are finally sold.

        Maybe the intention is to reconsider the issue at some stage down the track when the prospect of Sydney and/or Sydney West being sold starts to become close to reality, I do not know, but I found his response on that particular point most unconvincing. I would say on behalf of the opposition that we are happy to discuss the content of any cross&amp;hyphen;ownership regulations.

        This bill and the associated Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1996 are part of the Commonwealth's response to the horrific events at Port Arthur. This tragedy has concentrated attention on the fact that there are large holdings of types of rapid&amp;hyphen;fire weapons in our community which are simply not justifiable in the overall national interest.

        All Australian governments are acting swiftly on tighter gun control, a significant element of which is a 12&amp;hyphen;month amnesty and compensation scheme. This scheme, likely to begin formally on 1 July, will require gun owners to hand in those guns to be the subject of nationwide bans in return for fair and proper compensation. This covers all self&amp;hyphen;loading rifles, self&amp;hyphen;loading shotguns and pump&amp;hyphen;action shotguns, whether licensed or unlicensed, subject to very narrow exceptions.

        Through a one&amp;hyphen;off increase of 0.2 per cent in the Medicare levy, these bills will raise the necessary funds to reimburse states and territories for the direct cost of payments they will have made to relevant gun owners. I am reluctant at any time to add to the financial burden on Australians, but this bill imposes a special one&amp;hyphen;year impost which I think most Australians will regard as necessary in the
        <break page="1673" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         circumstances. Through contributing an amount estimated to cost someone on average weekly earnings a total of around $70, or $1.40 a week, Australians can assist in the greatest reduction of firearms ever contemplated in this or most other countries.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A very large total cost is involved. The estimate is that the increase in levy will raise around $500 million. The Commonwealth judges it to be in the national interest to offer assistance on such a scale to the states and territories, notwithstanding that gun control falls largely within their responsibilities. National leadership needs to be exercised so that the problem of the proliferation of these guns is confronted swiftly and adequately. The terms of the buyback scheme will be subject to national agreement and I have made it clear to premiers and chief ministers that funding by the Commonwealth is based on the strong agreement of all states and territories to implement the measures agreed at the meeting of police ministers on 10 May.

        I note that a recent University of Canberra study supports the government's conclusion that an increase in the Medicare levy for this purpose is the most desirable of several options, including on equity and efficiency grounds. The rate of Medicare levy will be raised from 1.5 per cent to 1.7 per cent for the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 income year only. The terms of the bill ensure that the rate will be returned to the present level of 1.5 per cent for the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and subsequent income years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill will allow imposition of a proportion of the full Medicare levy, equivalent to a rate of 0.2 per cent, on members of the defence forces, and in some circumstances members of their household, who are currently exempt from the Medicare levy. Again, this will be just for the duration of the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 income year. The same income thresholds, reduced levy and phasing&amp;hyphen;in arrangements applying to other taxpayers will apply. This measure puts defence personnel in the same position as other Australians required to meet this special community&amp;hyphen;wide impost.

         returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system. Details of the national amnesty and buyback scheme are being worked on by a working party of senior Commonwealth and state officials. The clear objective is to offer incentives which secure a significant return of firearms as expeditiously as possible. This includes a regime of fair and proper compensation with values set by people with appropriate expertise. It also includes significant penalties for those who fail to return banned weapons at the expiration of 12 months, with more serious penalties applying in respect of high firepower weapons.

        I understand that the thinking at this stage is that the scheme of compensation will involve a schedule of values for particular categories of firearm, depending on condition.

        I am gratified by the response of most Australians to the leadership shown by all governments on gun control. Many will be inconvenienced by this and other elements of the gun control package. It is a matter of honest regret that taxpayers need to meet this cost, and that law&amp;hyphen;abiding gun owners need to surrender guns which they have found useful to them in one way or another. The rural community in particular are likely to feel the brunt of tighter restrictions, though primary producers will be able to use smaller magazine, low powered semiautomatics where there is a demonstrable occupational need which cannot be met by other means. My experience of this community gives me every confidence that they will shoulder responsibly the burden that the new state gun laws will impose.

        I do not enjoy for one moment imposing this degree of additional regulation and inconvenience, which reaches into many law&amp;hyphen;abiding Australian homes. But, when the whole of the matter is weighed, there is a greater good to be served in taking such comprehensive measures. The profound national trauma which followed the gun violence at Port Arthur has caused us to ask

        Logic, not emotion, has carried all governments collectively to a conclusion that the availability of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns should be severely circumscribed and that there should be greater rigour generally in gun licensing and registration systems. All of us with public duties in this matter need to fully implement the agreement reached by police ministers and to keep our compact with the Australian people. These historic measures are designed to avoid any slide into a gun culture in this country. It is our obligation to build a better and a safer community for all Australians.

        These amendments relate to one quite significant change which has been made to the legislation in comparison with the equivalent legislation introduced to the House by the former Keating government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The change was explained in the second reading speech by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and it relates to the power on the part of the minister to exempt a private leaseholder of an airport from engaging in a process of public consultation and public comment with respect to a draft plan or strategic plan for the airport and for environmental considerations.

         The reason for it, as explained by the minister in the second reading speech, the opposition finds quite reasonable but we believe that the initial component of the legislation that has been put forward by the government is far broader than the intention announced by the minister.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister indicated that it was his intention to give the minister a power to exempt the leaseholder from public consultation and comment processes where those processes have previously occurred, a draft strategy plan was in place and, as a result of those processes having occurred, there was a need for an amendment to the plan and, therefore, under the previous government's legislation there would have had to be another round of public consultation. That arrangement opened up the possibility of an endless cycle of public consultation/amendment/further public consultation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition does not oppose the intention of the government. However, what we are concerned about is the fact that the provision that has been inserted effectively gives the minister the power to exempt a leaseholder from any public consultation process at all, including that with respect to the original plan or the original strategy that is under consideration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two amendments that I have put forward in effect narrow the scope of the ministerial power to the specific situation that the minister identified in his second reading speech, namely where there has been a draft plan put forward, where it has been subject to public consultation and comment and, as a result of that consultation and comment, a change is proposed to be made by the leaseholder. We think it is reasonable in those circumstances that, if the changes proposed have already been the subject of some public comment and consultation, there should not necessarily be a requirement for further consultation about making that change. The intention of our amendments is to narrow the power of the minister to exempt the leaseholder from any public comment to that particular situation.

         The minister has indicated previously a preparedness to consider these amendments.

          I understand he will be opposing them at this  stage but will give further thought to the matter prior to the bill going to the Senate. On the basis that he accepts at least the intention and logic of what the opposition is putting forward here, if not the precise words, and that he will give some consideration to the proposition that we are advancing and reconsider the position prior to the matter going to the Senate, it is not the opposition's intention to divide on this matter.

As he has pointed out, the intention of the government was to streamline the process and to make it more efficient. If we did not have this exemption in there, it would lead to an ongoing, endless round of consultations followed by amendments following which would require more consultations which would require more amendments which would just see us never getting anything done. I think the shadow minister has made that point quite clearly in his remarks and I appreciate that. We will consider the matter between now and when the bill passes through the Senate.

        This is a useful way to introduce debate on this legislation because it is important that we focus on the professed beliefs of this government and the core humanitarian values it asserts that are undermined by this heinous piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister (Mr Howard), when he was Leader of the Opposition, set forth a number of key principles prior to the last election. Included in his approach towards the area of immigration was a commitment to principles of multiculturalism and non&amp;hyphen;discriminatory practices and outcomes. In his speech to ACOSS he committed himself to an approach which would protect those who are least well off and most vulnerable in our society.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, this legislation undermines both those commitments. It is discriminatory and it impacts most adversely on those who are most vulnerable and least well off in our society. If you take a child's eye view of this legislation, that child would be asking, `Why, unlike all other children of permanent residents of Australia and citizens of this country, am I hungry? Why is it that I alone have parents who are not able to access the normal rates of family allowance that I in my destitution require for my food and sustenance? And despite the harsh special benefits tests that are being proposed in this legislation, and even though the department has assessed that my family through no fault of its own could not have anticipated the circumstances that have arisen to affect me and my family, why is it that I am being treated in this discriminatory way?'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The differences are not trivial. The harshness in this legislation is not merely to exclude all but 10 per cent of those persons who might ordinarily have come forward to seek access to special benefits, and that is the estimate from the advisers to the government on this point, but it is harsh also to say that even those people who fit the very tough test that has been set, who show that their hardship could not have been possibly anticipated, that their change of circumstances arose through no fault of their own and in circumstances where they could not have possibly anticipated it, do not have access to full
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         family allowance in breach of what was asserted by the Prime Minister before the election and thus leaving the children of those families in great poverty.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The difference is not slight. For example, taking a family with five kids, the difference is this: if you assume that three of those children are triplets—and there are special benefits for multiple births which that family will not now be eligible for—then the access to the special benefits safety net with a minimum family payment will be $113.50 a fortnight; that is, $22.70 per child.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, if that family is in destitution and needs, as the rest of the community does, a support basis that is able to sustain them because of their poverty and indigence through no fault of their own, they would normally have access to a maximum family payment of five times $93.10—a total sum of $465.50 a fortnight. In addition, they would be eligible for a multiple birth allowance of $90.90, a family supplement of $15 and rent assistance of $97.40—a total of $668.80. That exceeds by $550 per fortnight that which would be available to new arrivals in indigent circumstances.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What is the history of these measures? Why do we find ourselves in circumstances where anyone applying the UNICEF test—that is, looking at this legislation in terms of the rights of a child—finds that a child member of a resident family is being treated in this discriminatory way? Why is this the outcome?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government says that all they are doing is extending a principle introduced by the former Labor government. So it is important to look at some of the history.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In 1993, the then government introduced a six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period for new arrivals to this country to ensure that those new arrivals and their sponsors met some of the incidental costs of their initial settlement. The six&amp;hyphen;month period was selected as a balance. We had to meet our responsibilities as an Australian community to welcome and accept those who were here to become our new citizens—to provide for them a range of universal benefits through the health system, through educational opportunities and through welfare benefits. We had to provide for them a network of access and
         <break page="1678" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          equity opportunities, and training in skills that are necessary for them to be able to take advantage of their new residency in this country, for example, language training.
         </break>
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We put on one side our responsibility for these universal approaches, and on the other side we put the responsibility of those who sponsor new arrivals to meet the costs that are incidental to that new settlement. Six months was an appropriate balancing point. We made two exceptions to this: first, those who came here as refugees, or who came under the humanitarian program; and second, marriage partners of Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We took the view, and it was not contested at the time, that it was not part of this government's responsibility, or any government's responsibility, to tell Australians whom they could marry. To apply a waiting period to new arrivals coming here as the spouses of long&amp;hyphen;term residents and citizens of this country would intrude into one of the most fundamental rights of Australians, which is that of being able to select their life partner. We did it to enable that person to immediately form their family without their children being prejudiced in the way that I described before, and without their partner being subject to discriminatory tests which excluded them from a range of benefits that are otherwise available to the Australian community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In its run&amp;hyphen;up to the last election, the coalition addressed the question of a six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period. In its policy document, `Meeting our commitments', released in February, it said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a Coalition Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The document went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Full access to Family Allowance and Medicare will be maintained for all migrants immediately upon arrival. As well, the Coalition will provide a `safety net' in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those savings referred to in `Meeting our commitments' were costed at $616 million, but the coalition gave assurances that they

         would not be applied in a way which was inconsistent with the ordinary understanding of an extension of the previous government's safety net. The then shadow minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Jim Short, in a press release of 19 February said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Coalition's proposal to extend the six months to two years is simply an extended application of the principle established by Labor in 1993.

        <para>
         That is, they merely extended the period for the excluded benefits—jobsearch, newstart, youth training, parenting and sickness allowance—without any mention of an extension to new classes of persons who might be subject to exclusion or of extending the range of measures which would be subject to those exclusions. Indeed, the now Prime Minister gave a personal pledge on 16 February during the election campaign.

In light of these figures, does the Treasurer acknowledge that the growth forecasts for the years 1995&amp;hyphen;96 and 1996&amp;hyphen;97 of 3¼ per cent on which his revised budget forecasts were based are now completely out of date? Does he agree that, as the growth is now considerably stronger than that forecast in the 1995 budget, the so&amp;hyphen;called $8 billion black hole which he has tried to make so much of does not now exist?

Not only did he put the whole of the finance department onto the work but when he got the results back he sat on them for a week and then tried to doctor them in his own office—and you know you did.

        It is the policy of this government that allowances should be subject to taxation.

It is a principle which the government is determined to uphold, and the package does, in fact, do so in a number of ways. We have included within the objects of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill a specific object to highlight the importance which the government places on anti-discrimination provisions, which include anti&amp;hyphen;discrimination provisions in respect of awards, agreements, certified agreements and the like. We will therefore require the commission, in its award making function, to abide by that criteria. In the certified agreement process the commission is also required to take that into account, and the principle of equal pay for work of equal value is a minimum condition for those entering into Australian workplace agreements. I have had very constructive meetings with a number of women's organisations which have raised this issue with me. Let me stress that the principle is upheld in this legislation.

We have opted for the latter because we think it is a better means to proceed. In fact, our support for doing so is actually endorsed by a paper which canvassed these issues some years ago entitled

We are meeting with the industry again next week to continue the constructive negotiations on the questions of ensuring that the processing systems in exporting nations are up to scratch and to work through any adjustment questions. I conclude by saying that we give the assurance that no compromise on proper and thorough scientific analysis will be enabled.

         —My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I seek further clarification on an aspect of the Workplace Relations Bill. Minister, yesterday in response to questions on the bill, your answers referred only to people remaining in the same job. My question refers to the 370,000 young people who will start in a new job over the next year. I take the case of a 16-year-old who has just completed year 10 and wins a job as a trainee in the textile industry and spends a third of their working time in training. Is it not true that at present their wage cannot fall below $149 per week? Is it not true also that, under your bill, their wage can be as low as $130 per week—a 15 per cent difference? Is this because your bill allows young people's wages to be discounted twice—once for age and once for training? Do you still, therefore, claim that young workers will not be worse off under your bill? Will you amend the bill to ensure that they are not?

Under the national training wage—and your question is a bit like the question we had yesterday—if you work half the time and train half the time, then in those circumstances you are paid at 50 per cent the rate. In fact, in each and every one of those classifications that I have just read out to you, in respect of junior wages—that is the actual title on the table—the weekly wage rate for those employees is $128. So are they worse off? No, they are not. This is simply the application of the principle which you yourself have endorsed.

        It is true that three of the nation's pre&amp;hyphen;eminent scientists—Professor Sir Gus Nossal, Professor Don Metcalf and Professor Jacques Miller—are retiring early next week from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of medical and scientific research in Melbourne. Sir Gus Nossal served 31 years as director of the institute; Professor Metcalf, 31 years as assistant director and head of the cancer research unit; and Professor Jacques Miller, 30 years as head of the thymus biology unit. They now retire from the institute after a remarkable period of some 30 years of leadership, fostering young scientists and breakthroughs that have startled the world. They have individually and collectively inspired successive generations of scientists, doctors, researchers, technologists and, I am happy to say, politicians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sir Gus Nossal's research is in fundamental immunology, and he has written five books and 480 scientific articles in this and related fields. He was elected to the fellowship of the Academy of Science in 1967, and he is currently president of the Academy of Science. Many past and present members of this House have enjoyed the friendship and advice of Sir Gus Nossal. He has been, and continues to be, a fearless advocate for science and technology.

They are three great Australians of whom we are very proud. How can you measure their contribution to the community? You cannot, except to say that modern medicine would not be so advanced without their efforts.

         I should stress that they will not be lost to science altogether. Their work will continue in different ways in different places. Some believe, and have stated recently, that we will not see their like again, but we will because they have ensured we will, for they have prepared and nurtured following generations of scientists. The nation owes each one of them a debt of gratitude. I know the House joins me in expressing our thanks and best wishes for them in their retirement, wherever it takes them in their continuing dedication to science and technology.

        The reason there is a squeeze—nobody questions this—on labour market funding at the moment is that the two billion dollar man sitting right there spent $2 billion out of a $2.1 billion budget.

Ninety&amp;hyphen;five per cent of that labour market budget for 1995-96 was committed by the two billion dollar man—the member for Hotham—in an attempt to hide the unemployed from the statistics in the run&amp;hyphen;up to the election.

        The word went out to the managers of the labour market programs: `Spend up. Get as many off the unemployment statistics as you can and hide as many of those long-term unemployed as you can. Let's redefine them as short-term unemployed.' He is the man who is responsible for the squeeze now occurring on labour market programs.

        I would like to remind the House that it was only two years ago that Japan effectively ran out of rice before they opened up their market. That was part of the catalyst, including the Uruguay Round outcome, to the opening up of eight per cent of the Japanese rice market. Happily enough, many Australian rice growers—and I acknowledge the work of the former minister for trade, the member for Riverina, me and many others—are now supplying rice to that Japanese market. They are in a better and more secure circumstance as a consequence of those developments, as a consequence of further agricultural trade liberalisation.

        Too often, I point out to the member for Corangamite, the words `food security' and `self-sustainability' are a smokescreen for renewed protection. I think that agenda ought to be exposed. Indeed, when I attend the Cairns group meeting in Colombia next month, I will ensure that the reform process does stay on track. I believe that the Cairns group nations will furnish tactics which will help the development of the agenda for the WTO Round set down for Singapore in September.

         which needs to be monitored, and I will read with interest the reports when they are released. But to suggest that the world will run out of food within 10 years is alarmist. Indeed, I would make the additional point that there are certainly places in the world which will suffer acute food shortage—North Korea being one of those right this moment. The sooner North Korea reforms, deregulates and opens up, the better it will be in terms of its food trading circumstances.

It does not help this whole equation when the New South Wales state government goes around closing down laboratories in Wagga and Armidale and elsewhere in relation to the proper clearance, development and export activity with regard to the agricultural sector. Shame on them for making that decision.

         For that reason, the medals policy that was announced prior to the last election by the then shadow minister, which was very widely consulted on throughout the community, particularly the ex-service community, is now in the process of being implemented. The required regulations that need to be made by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General are prepared. There is also a requirement for Her Majesty the Queen to be involved. That has begun as well.

         With regard to the CIDA report, you accepted all but one of those recommendations. We accepted the lot.

We have extended the principles that were used in the CIDA report and, very simply, I will go back to the proposition that I made before; that is, the basis of our policy is a simple one. We value the contribution made by every individual not only the people who are singled out for special bravery awards but also the people who gave simple service, who joined in good faith and wished to serve their nation. Those are the people who will have recognition under our policy.

         —by leave—Mr Deputy Speaker, while I was in Thailand recently, I announced my determination that there would be an independent inquiry to deal thoroughly with repeated allegations that officers within my portfolio had been involved in paedophile activity and that the management had tolerated such activity. I acted decisively because, along with all Australians, I detest and condemn paedophilia. There is no way, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that I will allow officers within my portfolio to engage in such behaviour. If officers of my portfolio have been involved in paedophile activity or if there have been cover&amp;hyphen;ups, as has been alleged, I am determined that this will be exposed. I am also determined that if these allegations have no foundation, individuals' names are free of suspicion.

        This is an inquiry that has the power to compel witnesses. This is an inquiry that will allow those people who have any knowledge of paedophile activities to have the opportunity to make that knowledge available, with the confidence that they are protected and suffer no consequences to their positions of employment. At the same time, however, those disposed to make knowingly false, frivolous or vexatious allegations should be on notice

        Mr Hunt was appointed because it was recognised that, to investigate effectively many of the allegations being brought forward, a thorough knowledge of both public administration and procedures, as well as a legal background, would be essential. Mr Hunt is clearly well qualified in both these fields. In addition, he has extensive experience with independent investigations and inquiries, including a three&amp;hyphen;year term as deputy Commonwealth ombudsman and as a part&amp;hyphen;time member of the Merit Protection and Review Agency.

        An inquiry of this form using the terms of reference that have been developed for it undoubtedly provides the best means for examining the range of allegations that have been made. Being established under the Public Service Act, it will have the scope to consider and make recommendations on issues well beyond those of criminality—which are appropriately the domain of the Australian Federal Police—such as misconduct, unethical behaviour or activity that brings the service into disrepute.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The inquiry will not only concern itself with the behaviour of individual officers but also examine the systems, structure and culture of portfolio agencies to see whether they have been adequate in the effective management of Australia's representatives and their behaviour while overseas. To do this, the inquiry needs to be conducted by those who have experience in and of public administration.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These issues are crucial in so far as many of the allegations have not only focused on paedophile activity itself but also claimed that there have been official cover&amp;hyphen;ups of such activity. If there is any evidence of this, any suggestion that these matters have been suppressed by individual officers, the management of the relevant portfolio agencies, or indeed by anyone else, the inquiry will have the power to unearth it.

         It might not be appreciated how strong and wide ranging are the powers of the Public Service Commissioner to undertake an investigation of this nature. The inquiry will have extensive powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend hearings, whether they be public servants or members of the general public, and whatever their position or status. Penalties for noncompliance range from disciplinary action, in the case of offi cials, to fines and/or imprisonment. Evidence will be taken under oath.

        The inquiry will receive evidence regarding criminal matters, breaches of the Public Service Act and improper conduct.

        The combination of the AFP investigations and the inquiry ensures that all allegations, whether they refer to criminal or administrative actions, will now be examined in detail. That is the key feature of the inquiry as it has been constituted. Concerns have been raised that some allegations in the past could not be investigated fully by the Australian Federal Police because they were not of a criminal nature. I refer to allegations of paedophilia that predate the introduction of the child sex

       </para>

        It is important to emphasise that the inquiry will be able to build upon the police investigations, to include matters of an administrative nature, to examine whether allegations have been brought to the knowledge of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID or Austrade in the past and, if so, what actions were taken. The inquiry will seek out whether allegations were investigated, ignored or suppressed and whether the reputation of agencies was put above the best interests of the Australian public.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The inquiry will examine what procedures are and were in place to ensure that officers could report confidentially any allegations of criminal or inappropriate activity by their colleagues in order to ensure their full investigation. The inquiry will be able to judge whether officers have been hindered from coming forward with any knowledge they may have, and whether the system can be improved.

        Allegations that aid funds have been disbursed with the intent of benefiting officers in the pursuit of paedophile activities are deeply disturbing and, if true, utterly unacceptable to this government, all decent Australians and, I am sure, the parliament as a whole. These allegations are rightly being investigated by the police. If true, they are doubly criminal—involving both paedophile activity and also what amounts to fraudulent use of government funds. The inquiry will examine what mechanisms are in place for the scrutiny and accountability of these funds, to ensure that they cannot be used for the benefit of paedophiles.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With the establishment of the inquiry, every effort has now been made to determine the truth of all these matters.

        The terms of reference also task the inquiry to make recommendations concerning a code of conduct for all staff representing Australia overseas to ensure that their behaviour is appropriate and beyond question, over and above that applying to public servants in general. We expect and demand that those representing all Australians must be above reproach in both their professional and private lives.
       </para>

        The inquiry is also tasked to recommend improved procedures for handling such issues in the future, so as to guarantee greater scrutiny and accountability.

        As the inquiry gets under way, I want to again make it abundantly clear that I will not tolerate paedophile activity within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID or Austrade. I am sure that all officers of those agencies will welcome the opportunity provided by the inquiry to clear the air on this subject and have the facts determined on issues which have been the cause of speculation and untested allegations. Mr Hunt will shortly be seeking submissions and those persons who have any information or evidence should now produce it to the inquiry. In fact, they have a responsibility to do so.

         —by leave—The statement just made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) deals with a very serious issue of deep concern to all Australians. There is no doubt that the exploitation of children by paedophiles, whether it occurs overseas or here at home, is particularly abhorrent criminal conduct of the very worst kind. Two years ago this parliament responded to the deeply felt concerns of all Australians on this disturbing issue of paedophilia with the passage of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 with the unanimous support of the House.

        More recently, we have all been shocked and appalled by evidence concerning paedophilia given before the New South Wales royal commission headed by Mr Justice Wood. I know all members of the parliament share my grave concern over the allegations that have been made and the publicity that we have seen regarding allegations of Australian diplomatic service personnel being engaged in the sexual abuse of children overseas. Nothing could be more repulsive. Nothing could be more reprehensible. Nothing could be more vile.

         The allegations concern the ruthless exploitation of the most underprivileged and deprived children in the world, which makes it all the more awful. No member of this parliament would question that every effort must be made to ruthlessly hunt down and bring to justice any Australian citizen who has engaged in such abhorrent and predatory behaviour. Action is also required because we need to make sure that the reputation of our diplo matic service—the international reputation and the domestic reputation of what is a very fine and highly professional diplomatic service—is not tarnished, not damaged, by lingering suspicions that it harbours persons engaged in such loathsome criminal behaviour.

        In June last year, the House will recall that the former member for Deakin, Mr Aldred, made a number of very serious allegations against officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade concerning paedophile activity and the alleged toleration of such activity by the senior management of the department. The response by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, now the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), and the then secretary to the department, Michael Costello, was swift indeed. An extensive investigation into Mr Aldred's allegations was conducted without delay by the Australian Federal Police both into the specific allegations concerning particular individuals and into the claim that the department had tolerated and promoted diplomats known to be paedophiles.

        The result of the AFP investigation was given to the Senate by my colleague, then Senator Gareth Evans, in answer to a question without notice on 30 November last year. I do not intend to repeat the substance of that statement this afternoon, but the House should note that the Australian Federal Police found that `there is no evidence to support the allegation that the senior management of DFAT had tolerated and promoted diplomats known to be paedophiles'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The AFP further advised that `during the investigation no evidence was revealed to substantiate the allegation that DFAT has obstructed investigation of this matter, attempted to prevent examination of relevant documents or deter departmental officers from providing evidence'. As honourable members will be aware, one senior officer of the department has been charged under the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act and investigations by the AFP are continuing.

         Since November last year, I think all Australians have been deeply disturbed by the evidence on paedophilia which has been given before the New South Wales royal commis sion and the evidence of the disappearance of the alleged paedophile Phillip Bell and a series of further newspaper reports concerning alleged paedophile activity by DFAT officers overseas. Those included allegations of allegedly misused discretionary aid funds to benefit persons engaged in paedophile activities.

        Those newspaper reports—and there were many of them; there was wide publicity—culminated in April when the Minister for Foreign Affairs correctly concluded that a far ranging inquiry was required to get to the full truth of the issue. In doing so, I think he properly set high standards for such an inquiry. Speaking in Jakarta on 17 April he declared that he will `leave no stone unturned on this issue' and that any allegation of paedophilia would be `fully and vigorously investigated'. Three days later he announced his intention to proceed with an independent inquiry. I think he was in Bangkok at that time. He said that he would be `completely ruthless' in hunting down any paedophiles in DFAT and that any such activities would be `wiped out'.

        We need to remember that these were strong commitments indeed given by the minister: `leave no stone unturned', `fully and vigorously investigated', `completely ruthless' in hunting it down and wiping it out. He said:

        I tell you, we are going to deal with this sort of behaviour quite ruthlessly. I am not having Australian diplomats' reputations smeared if their reputations do not deserve to be smeared. But if there are Australian diplomats, even very junior diplomats, behaving in a way that does not befit the standards Australians expect of them then we don't want these people any more. No ifs, no buts. If there have been any cover-ups in the past as some people claim there have been, well they'll be exposed. I am really going to dig into this.

        I put it to the House that only an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission—that is, unfettered powers to take public and indeed in camera evidence where appropriate—can ensure that the full truth of these matters is determined and exposed so that full confidence in our diplomatic service can be restored. If there is anything less than an unfettered inquiry, we will see a result that will fall short of the standards set by the minister himself and the standard demanded by the Australian people. Anything less will only leave lingering doubts and suspicions and risk permanent damage to the reputation of our diplomatic representatives and to the standing of our nation abroad.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think what the minister has announced today plainly fails that test. Regrettably, what we are to get is a secret, only in camera, Public Service inquiry which falls far short of what is required to satisfy the concerns of all Australians on this very serious issue. The inquiry will be conducted under the provisions of the Public Service Act. The Public Service Act is an act there to protect public servants from undue and unfair processes. The minister has made much in his statement of the power of the inquiry to compel witnesses, but the inquiry will have no power under the Public Service Act to compel witnesses who are not public servants.

         As the minister has said, all the hearings will be held in camera. That is, each and every one of the hearings will be behind closed doors. That is understandable in some cases. You often need to take evidence in camera. With the commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the inquiry conducted by Gordon Samuels, there was an absolute necessity, because of the security issues involved, to keep it behind closed doors, but that should not be the case in respect of this matter.

         Regrettably, the inquiry announced by the minister is manifestly inadequate as a response to deeply felt concerns of all Australians on the issue. It fails to live up to the high standards set by the minister when he announced his intention to proceed with an inquiry. I think one might have thought the government could have learnt from the experience of ICAC in New South Wales, which inquired into the allegations of paedophile activities in New South Wales but over a lengthy period of time failed to get to the bottom of them. ICAC had much wider powers—infinitely wider powers than those afforded to the inquiry announced today.

          Mr Justice Wood himself has left no doubt that the powers of a royal commission are absolutely essential if the vital truth of matters is to be revealed and the concerns of the public satisfied. I think the less than fulsome inquiry announced today, which does not have any of those powers, is one that tragically will be considered by many critics to be inad equate, no matter how good and how solid the work of the inquiry is. I think that is highly regrettable, but it is inherent in the terms of reference.

He has left his inquiry, very sadly, open to allegations that it is nothing more than a Public Service whitewash. I think he has failed in his duty and he has failed his own public commitments.

         —In a relatively short span of time, this government has managed to achieve something truly remarkable. We have seen over the last couple of weeks the forging of an absolutely unprecedented alliance of people and organisations concerned with Australia's university system. We saw on Monday the formation of a coalition comprising academic staff, students, university administrations from a variety of different kinds of institutions, alumni organisations and learned societies. These are organisations which quite often have found themselves in adversarial situations and often have not found themselves with a commonality of interests.

         On this particular occasion, there is absolute and overwhelming condemnation of what this government has indicated it is proposing to do in the higher education area and of the enor mous uncertainty and anxiety that has been brought into existence as a consequence of the handling of the education portfolio by the senior portfolio minister, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone).

        The senior portfolio minister has tried to fend off some of these claims and concerns by saying that universities and their administrations and students and staff are running a scare campaign. One of the university vice-chancellors put it very succinctly the other day when he said, `We are not running a scare campaign, we are running a scared campaign.' They have very good reason to be concerned on the basis of what has been revealed so far about the government's intentions.

At this point, the clearest indication has come from the senior minister in the portfolio in respect of higher education.

        How do we sum up the senior portfolio minister's performance in relation to her responsibilities for education, training and employment programs in this country?

Her performance has been marked by ineptitude.

        This minister went along to the celebrated dinner held by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. When asked about the possibility of funding cuts, she flippantly said, `How about 12 per cent for starters?' then erupted into giggles. Needless to say, the reaction that occurred in response to that was not only predictable but entirely justified. We have seen the bitter anti-intellectualism of this minister demonstrated at a conference on the education of gifted children at which international observers were present. The transcript

         of what she said at this conference was circulated extensively over the Internet. It got so embarrassing that the chair of the organisation conducting the conference felt she had no alternative but to shut the conference down and remove Senator Vanstone from the stage.

        Last Friday we saw a speech made by Senator Vanstone to the Graduate Careers Council on the occasion of a survey of the destination of university graduates. This speech was intended, in part, to be a denunciation of the former government's record. The minister spoke about the situation that the present government inherited from Labor, and then, two paragraphs later—this is rather remarkable—she said:

       <para>
        That is true, but isn't it interesting that a minister with responsibility for that area cites, in condemnation of the former government, this very large increase? What does that tell us about her intentions?

        This is a government that, while in opposition during the period of the so-called unmet demand crisis of 1992, was tearing into the previous government over the fact that significant numbers of students sought a university place but could not get one.

         A recent scientific study published as `Profitable Neighbours: The Economic Impact of the University of New South Wales on the Randwick Municipality' found a magnitude of benefit even greater than that of the Port Kembla steelworks for the Illawarra.

         The impact of this on local economies and local communities will be dramatic and disastrous. The University of Western Sydney conducted a media conference at noon today about the impact of the cuts that have been mooted in education provision on communities in the west of Sydney. The regional universities themselves have recently issued a press release on this issue, which refers to the impact of potential cuts on local communities. It states:

         This is the situation that we are facing here. This government is, as I say, the same group that talked about unmet demand. It chose to attack us over the lack of adequate funding for universities when we were in office, and now it turns around and completely repudiates a black&amp;hyphen;letter election commitment that was given to the sector. What does that say about the integrity and commitment of this government?

In the House last week, in answer to a question about the new schools policy, he did something which I suppose in a sense is commendable but unusual.

Let me put before the House exactly what they did for regional Australia. One of the reasons regional Australia turned against the government was its appalling record in improving educational advantage for regional Australia. The participation rate of rural students in higher education in 1995—the

Youth unemployment in regional Australia in a number of areas was well over 40 per cent and in some cases over 50 per cent. I am talking about areas such as the Wide Bay&amp;hyphen;Burnett area of Queensland and the coastal regions of New South Wales, such as Illawarra and Wollongong.

We believe that Austudy should go to those in need. What they put in place is an incredibly complex process. There will not be many members from regional Australia representing farming communities on that side of the House. Actually one of the two is at the table.

He put them right down the bottom of the list. It said, `These are the poor universities.' They were the universities that were trying to attract overseas students. Were they poor universities? It was just a typical bureaucratic response to quality from a minister who was a member of the left faction. They love bureaucracy. It is the committee left, the bureaucratic left.

Regional New South Wales has actually woken up to the fact that this federal government is in big trouble.

        There is no doubt that under the coalition educational opportunities for young Australians will be severely limited and compromised, and nowhere in Australia will that impact more strongly and starkly than in regional Australia. And who is leading this charge to decimate education? It is none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself, unashamedly followed by a lap&amp;hyphen;dog Treasurer (Mr Costello), the hapless Senator Amanda Vanstone and, of course, the member for Goldstein, who is walking out of the chamber.

        The federal coalition wants to reduce the Commonwealth's role in education, and that direction is obviously coming from the Prime Minister himself. When the Prime Minister lost the Liberal leadership to Andrew Peacock, he refused the education portfolio in the shadow ministry, and there is no reason to believe he thinks more highly of education now. In fact, even in his Headland speech in June last year the current Prime Minister said:

         When questioned the other day by the shadow education and youth affairs minister at the table, the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin), about whether the government would keep its promises to the higher education sector, Prime Minister Howard said only that he won't respond. Of course he won't respond; he wants Senator Vanstone to be the patsy, he wants Senator Vanstone to bear the brunt of his ideological frenzy and drive to slash and burn education.

         I am led to believe by my Senate colleagues that Senator Vanstone made a reasonable fist of her shadow Attorney portfolio. Of course, we need to understand that the shadow Attorney&amp;hyphen;General was in this chamber so she was not really tested, but in the education portfolio she is hopelessly mismatched. It is beyond her capabilities. I suspect Senator Hill is in the same boat because he was a former equally mismatched shadow education spokesperson. I do not think he is much better off in environment. Both these people will be dispensable down the track. The inevitable reshuffle of the government front bench will not save Senator Vanstone, nor perhaps Senator Hill, nor perhaps the regional university in the seat of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). But, in the meantime, poor old Senator Vanstone will do the Prime Minister's bidding of slashing education at all levels and writing her own personal political epitaph as a minister.

That is where the link is between education and employment. The opposition has failed on four counts. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report on mental illness in New South Wales has pinned it right down to the Keating government's failure to acknowledge that there is a link between rural hardship, education and employment opportunities.

So the cost to get students a tertiary education, to send them to university, has been borne by their families. There was no opportunity to help people.

        This was the man who at that stage was claiming a mortgage on political integrity and was saying in public that nothing so undermines the integrity of the political process than the cynical repudiation of pre-election undertakings by a newly elected government. Pre&amp;hyphen;election, we had a clear understanding that all that was to be done was extend from six months to two years the waiting period Labor had introduced. There was no suggestion it be extended by any degree either to new measures or to new classes of persons. We were told expressly by the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister, that it did not apply to family allowance and other benefits.

        What did we find out immediately after the election? We discovered the Prime Minister wrote to Senator Vanstone on 13 May and said:

        There it is. Immediately after the election, contrary to those undertakings, it will apply to other benefits.

        How can you square this with the Prime Minister's pre&amp;hyphen;election statement, when he said, `Can I make it clear: it, of course, does not apply to family allowance and other benefits'? The people who were given those words of comfort and assurance—those
        <break page="1714" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         sections of the community who are concerned about these matters—would be feeling sick in the guts now that they are seeing the sort of cynicism that the Prime Minister decried in the public arena when he said before the election that nothing so betrays the nature of the parliamentary process than the cynical repudiation of election commitments by an incoming government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will now compare the details of the proposed two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period for migrants with the previous six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period. I will start with the changes to the exemption provisions. Firstly, absences from Australia during the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period will not count towards that period. For many people this will mean that the waiting period is substantially longer than two years. Secondly, the present exemption for spouses of permanent residents of longer than two years is withdrawn, so that Australian residents of long standing and Australian citizens now cannot meet and marry people from overseas without the spouses incurring these kinds of penalties. Never before has an Australian government told Australians whom they can marry to their prejudice. Yet this is a measure introduced without notice to the public before the election. Holders of subclass 820 visas are specifically mentioned to the effect that they are subject to the waiting period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I now come to the payments excluded under the proposed provisions. We have previously addressed benefits such as jobsearch, newstart, youth training, parenting and sickness allowances—allowances essentially encompassed by the old concept of unemployment benefits—but the government, unannounced, has added to the list. It has included partner allowance and mature age allowance—because, it says, of the changes to the residency requirement which will take effect from July l996. It has added widow's allowance and carer's pension—which previously carried no length of residency requirement. It has included the disability wage supplement, maternity allowance, child disability allowance and double orphan allowance, which were all paid before with no waiting period. It has included mobility allowance, the Commonwealth seniors card and the health care card.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Family payment will only be paid at the minimum rate of $22.70 per child per fortnight when, previously, it had been available to everyone in Australia who had children. Many of those people are taxpayers, not the people described in the current rhetoric as the `unemployed bludging on taxpayers'. It is the people who have come here to make their home and who are earning income who will be punished in this way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That raises the issue of discrimination. A two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period for these benefits will not apply to people who come from New Zealand. In the case of some benefits, particularly sickness allowance, the waiting period will not apply to people from the United Kingdom. Reciprocal agreements with Italy, Portugal and Spain were negotiated in anticipation that benefits to migrants would be available on arrival and there must be debate going on in the department at the moment in light of these proposed measures.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Children of both new arrivals and long&amp;hyphen;term residents and citizens are being treated in a discriminatory way. I asked departmental advisers about this the other day but I could not get an answer about whether they had received advice on the inconsistency of these discriminatory measures with the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not have a settled view yet because I have not had time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill was first introduced without notice last Thursday. Contrary to undertakings provided to me by the minister's office that we could have a draft of this legislation to look at, no such opportunity was presented. We have had no opportunity to undertake the kind of research that would enable us to address the question of whether problems arise because of the inconsistency of this bill with the Racial Discrimination Act. Obviously, that is an issue which will need to be looked at as the debate goes on.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of implications of this measure. Firstly, there will be great pressure on emergency relief services. Such bodies are partially dependent on Commonwealth funding and will be asking for additional assistance to meet the additional demands placed upon them. There will be great poverty and great inequity between the different classes of
         <break page="1715" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          persons, and I am certain that a number of examples of that will be provided in the course of this debate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One example is the carer's pension. Under the previous government there was no waiting period for this benefit. This legislation will mean that an Australian citizen in need of the special care that could be provided by a relative coming from overseas will have to have sufficient means to be able to support themselves and the carer for the first few years of the carer's stay. I cannot see how that would assist in the provision of a comprehensive welfare scheme for Australian citizens.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a number of other examples that I am sure other speakers will give. I come back to the Prime Minister. Even after the Prime Minister's letters to his ministers, he came before the House last Wednesday on 22 May and said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition . . . You introduced a six&amp;hyphen;month period. All we have done is extend your six months to two years.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Howard has said, in another context, that he is desperate to be honest. That really is a mark of desperation. Anyone else who made the commitments that were made by the Prime Minister before the election, wrote to his ministers as the Prime Minister did, and then stood up and made the claim that the Prime Minister made would be entitled to have those remarks called lies. But of course this is the honourable man who is desperate to be honest; this is the Prime Minister who has the mortgage on integrity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the Prime Minister has form in playing politics with the ethnic communities. He is already following a well worn track in what he has done: the abolition of the Office of Multicultural Affairs and taking a minister out of the cabinet and giving that junior minister responsibility for immigration, pretending that minister can have a coordinating role. I suppose what the Prime Minister would defend himself with is the same thing that was said in the fable about the snake.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         An old person came upon an injured snake. Having taken the snake home, given it comfort and brought it back to health, the snake
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          then bit the old person. In dying, the old person turned to the snake and asked, `Why did you do that?' The answer was, `You must have known I was a snake when you took me in.'
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That can be the only explanation of how the Prime Minister can defend what he has done. When he gave his undertakings to the concerned communities he said the changes would not apply to family allowance and other benefits—but his audience was really to understand that they would. Of course they would. He always intended to do that. Of course he was going to be deceitful. Of course he was not going to change. He would never be anything other than the snake he had always been. That is the only explanation that is possible.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In terms of failure in this area, there is no greater failure than that displayed by the then shadow Treasurer, now the Treasurer (Mr Costello), in the costings. Mr Costello costed the savings for these measures—announced by the coalition before the election—at $616 million: $84 million in the first year of operation, $252 million in the second and $280 in the third. The brief to the incoming government revealed that those costings had been terribly flawed. Based on departmental estimates, and assumptions of a 30 per cent up&amp;hyphen;take rate on special benefit under very restrictive circumstances, they estimated savings over a three&amp;hyphen;year period to be only $259.1 million—a shortfall on Costello's figures of $356.9 million.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The explanatory memorandum, which was circulated when this bill first came out, changed those numbers yet again. But since the government has come to office there have been all of these new measures put in which the minister did not anticipate, which were not announced and which were new changes in the cabinet submission. Even with all those, all you get is $29 million worth of savings in the first year, $132.4 million in the second and $171.1 in the third. This assumes that only 10 per cent of those who would apply for special benefit because of the tightening up rules would have access to those benefits—total savings of $332.5 million and still leaving a shortfall of $283.5 million.

        <break page="1716" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          But in a later explanatory memorandum circulated by the minister, in what must be the most rubber ball costings of all time, we have another $15 million found. So we now have savings of $31.4 million in the first year, $143.5 million in the second and $185.6 in the third—total savings of $360.5 million, a shortfall of $255.5 million, plus implementation costs of over $17 million, as revealed in the brief to the incoming government. Yet whatever they do, they cannot fill the gap in their own savings measures. The Costello figures were just fraudulent. Even when you lie to the Australian people—

           —Even when you proceed in that manner, you cannot make the savings claimed. So there are three huge embarrassments here—firstly, for the Prime Minister's integrity. He is blaming those who have failed to understand that when he said, `Of course it doesn't apply to family allowances and other benefits,' they really should have understood him to mean, `Of course it does apply to family allowances and other benefits.'

          It also shows up the Treasurer's incompetence and gross inflation of his estimates of savings. In the Senate, it shows up Senator Newman's credibility because she is still denying that the government has made final decisions in relation to matters, which correspondence signed by the Prime Minister shows final decisions have been taken on—a misleading of the Senate. It also shows policy ineffectiveness because the outcomes will not be achieved. It is very plain that the government has no chance of affecting the inflow of migration in these areas because, as has been shown in a whole series of reports, chain migration, which sustains population flows, is notoriously difficult to influence, let alone

          It is certainly likely that, while the new measures are unlikely to achieve their obvious aims of dampening family migration, they are likely to cause hardship and deprivation to people and families who are already amongst the most poor and vulnerable in our society.

          Professor Birrell, who has written quite a lot on this subject in terms of intake and numbers, has argued that it is naive to think that the denial of social security benefits for two years will be a sufficient disincentive to reduce spouse sponsorship from countries like the PRC and Vietnam, which I assume to be the secret agenda behind what is being done by this government. Our approach is very different.

        Just before coming into the chamber I had a look at some figures on bankruptcies throughout Australia in the past 12 months. They are very interesting figures that show that in the past 12-month period personal bankruptcies throughout Australia—that is, for the period from March 1995 to March 1996—increased by 26 per cent. That does not include corporate bankruptcies.

        I will talk very briefly about the question of retrospectivity because that is one of the matters raised by the honourable member for Denison. The member would be aware—if he is not he should be because he was in government at the time—that advice of the impending legislation was sent to the department. That advice was sent to Australian legations

        I rise to join the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996 with a degree of sadness. I am speaking in support of the bill, but I would rather it had not been necessary. The situation that we found ourselves in, as I said earlier, has made it absolutely vital that these measures be taken. Australia is facing huge, monumental financial problems with more than three-quarters of a million Australians out of work.

        As I said earlier, I speak on this bill with a degree of sadness. I well recall my early days in Australia as a migrant and the privations my mother, my father and I had to endure, but endure we did. I am confident that new migrants to Australia will also cope—admittedly under stress but no doubt secure in the knowledge that Australia has provided us and will provide them with a unique opportunity to succeed in life in an environment that guarantees peace, political stability and
        <break page="1718" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Before the two-year period ends—and that is something the honourable member for Denison did not touch upon—these benefits will be available to those who are in desperate need. In addition, provision is made in the bill for a special safety net that will be provided via access to special benefits in the event that new immigrants' circumstances change beyond their control. If their circumstances change significantly for reasons beyond their control, then that safety net will be provided.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I hasten to add that further safety net provisions are also included in the bill. Again, the honourable member for Denison said absolutely nothing about that. He mentioned the People's Republic of China and Vietnam, but he obviously did not read the bill in detail because it is very clearly stated in the bill that further safety net provisions will be available by providing special exemptions for refugees and humanitarian migrants, including special assistance category migrants, as well as for their immediate family members.

        I think it is salutary for all, as part of this debate, to point out that Australia compares more than favourably with other countries that have a migration program, especially in regard to social security payments. Australia has a unique non-contributory social security system and the payment of benefits is not based on the contribution based system of payments. Rather, it is based solely and universally on the basis of residence. Of course, it is means tested. In other words, there is no requirement for contributions to a social insurance scheme, as happens in other parts of the world. Offhand, I think Britain and Canada, among other countries, have a contributory scheme. Nor is there a requirement for past employment in one's adopted country, such as in the USA.

         —Australians are generous people who are determined to provide a fair go and are tolerant of each other; however, the economic situation does not allow us to be as financially generous as we have been in the past. I am sure all new immigrants and their sponsors will appreciate the situation we in Australia find ourselves in with regard to the difficulties experienced with the Australian economy. These measures will in no way lessen the Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer coalition's commitment to the long-term welfare of all new immigrants to Australia.

         —This is a bad piece of legislation which clearly contravenes commitments that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave both before the election and after, not only in the specific terms in relation to the treatment of migrants but also in more general terms in his commitment to maintain a viable social safety net in this country.

        The regrettable thing about the way this sort of measure is coming forward is that it is obviously the case that the Prime Minister and his party believe that this is the sort of thing you can do without significant electoral cost. He obviously believes that on the talkback circuits and so forth there will be substantial support for the kind of measure he is introducing. There is a current of sympathy out there for the view that there are people abusing the social security system. The previous government implemented a whole raft of measures designed to minimise that abuse.

        I think the problem with this sort of circumstance is that it is very easy to canvass votes, to seek public support and to do the talkback circuits and to do the tabloid media, but the reality at the end of the day is that there are going to be some very disadvantaged people placed in very dire circumstances indeed. It would have been nice to think there was some sort of moral commitment or some sense of

        I think this legislation is also significant in what it prefigures about the present government's approach to a range of these sorts of issues. Before the election, the coalition, in seeking to argue that its spending commitments had been fully funded, put forward a whole raft of savings measures, including a number in the social security area. This was one. It claimed various savings in respect of those measures.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are four major measures proposed for savings in the social security area. The first is this particular one, in respect of which savings of $616 million were being claimed over a four-year period. The second one was the pension bonus plan, in respect of which $180 million was being claimed. Thirdly, it was said that by tightening up on the activity test applied to people who were unemployed you could save $331 million over a three-year period. Lastly, there was reference to allegedly additional fraud control measures that could be taken in Social Security that would save a further $180 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the election campaign, we in government argued that savings of this order of magnitude were illusory. Indeed, that point has been well and truly confirmed by what has happened since. For example, take this proposition. At least there are significant savings in this one—we never disputed that. But we certainly disputed the order of magnitude of savings that was being claimed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The department briefed the incoming government on the estimated savings that were to be attained as a result of this program. The savings claimed by Mr Costello in the document that he issued on costings were: 1996&amp;hyphen;97, $84 million; 1997-98, $252 million; and, 1998-99, $280 million. The Department of Social Security savings estimates for the same measures were: 1996-97, $22.7 million; 1997-98, $103.1 million; and, 1998-99, $133.3 million. That is obviously substantially less. When added up it comes to $259.1 million. These were the estimates that were

         made for the initial version of the proposals as the department interpreted them.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We have since seen the inclusion of a whole raft of additional payments in the ambit of this measure, which were listed by the previous opposition speaker. There has been reference to new payments such as the carer pension, the mature age allowance, the double orphan pension, and the child disability allowance. Particularly significant is the fact that family payment is to be brought within the ambit. The only payment which people affected by this preclusion period will be able to get is the minimum rate, which, I think, is $22 a fortnight. This is a major new element that was not indicated by the coalition when in opposition. In a speech in Queanbeyan the Prime Minister explicitly indicated that the ambit of this measure would not be extended to payments of this kind, particularly family payments.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result, the savings which are now estimated and which appear in the explanatory memorandum to the bill are significantly in excess of the $259 million that the department initially estimated. The current estimate in the bill over the four&amp;hyphen;year period to 1998-99 is $360.5 million. That is still very much shy of the original estimate of $616 million. At least there are some significant savings in this measure.

        Then the coalition reckon they can get $331 million from the activity test on the unemployed. The problem with that was that the Department of Finance could not even cost the thing because no specific set of measures was described. It is one thing to say, in a general sense, that further savings will be achieved through tightening the activity test, but you have to describe a set of administratively feasible, cost&amp;hyphen;effective measures to give effect to that proposition. That is what the coalition singularly failed to do. They were repeatedly challenged to do so. When Mr Costello released the coalition's costings document, he said that all would be revealed when the coalition's social security policy was released. It was released a couple of days later, but there was absolutely no attempt to describe the specific measures that would be implemented to achieve the savings on the activity test.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the brief to the incoming government on this matter there is a description of a number of further measures that could be taken, but there nothing like the order of magnitude of savings. There are the sorts of things that, when challenged, the coalition talk about, such as telephone contact with employers. In that regard, the brief makes this point:

        It was obviously a ludicrous proposition, something that the coalition spokesman on social security thought of on the run during the election campaign. It was obviously not
        <break page="1721" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         practical. So there was the alleged saving on the activity test on the unemployed. Then there were additional fraud control measures, with savings of $180 million. Again, the finance department could not even cost it because no actual specific measures were put forward. Interestingly enough, in the brief to the incoming government, there is no reference to this measure. So presumably the departmental officers putting it together and scratching their heads could not even think of what, in specific terms, the coalition might have been talking about.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So across the range of these social security measures, including this one, there is a huge overestimation of potential savings, with some measures having simply non-existent savings. Having established that the savings simply were not there for the proposal as described, we then see clear commitments in regard to these proposals being breached and a whole raft of extra nasties being worked in—extra payments, extra categories of people, spouses of people with more than the exclusion period. We see more people and more categories being worked in.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think we are going to see a recurring phenomenon. When they finally work out and accept that the savings in the activity test that they talk about simply are not available, I think we will start to see some very nasty things being done to the unemployed. I would not at all rule out a breach of the Prime Minister's commitment not to cut the rate of payment to the unemployed.

        Pensioners will finally accept that the savings from the pension bonus plan are a fraction of what they are claiming. I believe that we are going to see measures that really will disadvantage pensioners. There might be a bit of sleight of hand involved. It may not be done by an actual cut in the rate of pensions per se, but anybody who is heavily dependent on pharmaceuticals had better watch out. It is fairly clear that concessional arrangements in regard to access to pharmaceuticals are going to come under challenge in this budget.

        As has been mentioned, there are four measures in the social security area. I will come back to this particular proposition, which is a thoroughly objectionable thing. There has been some discussion about the existence of a safety net and the fact that people will be able to access a special benefit. In order to access a special benefit under this legislation, people will have to meet standard requirements: that is, having absolutely no other available means of support, either in cash or in kind. You will have to meet this additional test of having been subject to some unforeseen and unforeseeable change of circumstance, which might seem reasonable to some. We need to bear in mind that we are not just talking about the principal individuals concerned. These people may well have dependants or dependent children.

        The effect of this measure is that it is going to render a number of people absolutely and totally destitute—without any source of income support. You might be moralistic and say that these people brought it on themselves, that they did not anticipate the circumstances that would apply when they came to Australia. There might be some on the government side who would say that they are in some sense blameworthy and that they ought to be subject to this, but how does that apply to their dependent children?

         things that this government has tried to do is to construct a comprehensive social safety net in addition to providing basic income support entitlements. We tried to do this in such a way that everybody who had a reasonable claim did not—as with breaches of the activity test for the newstart and jobstart allowances—consciously fail to comply with a reasonable requirement for qualification for payment. We had a safety net that picked up everybody who was not in that category. That is not the case in the United States, and you see the consequences of it.

With the tightening of the activity test, they were pressed to actually say how, in concrete practical terms, the savings that they were talking about would be achieved. They failed to do that.

The Liberal Party recognises the enormous contribution migrant people have made to our nation in terms of their contribution of capital, skills and their culture. This government and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised the people of Australia before the last election that we would retain our migrant intake  levels the same as they were for the previous government. Recent reports show that migrants entering Australia under categories such as the business skills category will contribute more than $1 billion to the economy and create more than 7,200 jobs. Therefore, in all aspects and all respects our immigration program is an important part of what we see as our national development.

Officially known as the restricted immigration policy under the Commonwealth Immigration Restriction Act 1901, this policy had popular support, not only amongst the community but also by the likes of Alfred Deakin.

         Since my election in March a considerable number of my constituents have contacted me seeking my assistance with matters on immigration. Often they have a relative or a friend who may be trying to migrate to Australia, yet are unable to do so as a result of their failure in some respect to meet the present criteria. Out of the thousands of people who are not successful in their bid to migrate to Australia, most of them would make a worthwhile contribution to our country. The reality is that we as a nation have to impose some restrictions because of our economy and the state it has been left in by Labor after 13 years of mismanagement. As a result, the government has an obligation both to those applying and to the wider Australian community to ensure that our immigration system is both fair and equitable.

         It is this overriding need for equity that brings this legislation before the House today. The following quote comes from the Department of Social Security points test information sheet, produced in November last year under the previous government. The quote reads as follows:

         I find it ironic that Labor laid down a test for prospective migrants which was subjected to the phrase `without relying on the Australian government'. Their action in the House of not properly supporting this bill will perpetrate a system in which some migrants will rely on the Australian government after a very short period of time in Australia. If Labor was serious about its previous policy positions, it would be fully supporting this bill today. However, it comes as no surprise that the opposition intends to vote against this bill, as it has opposed every other major piece of legislation that has been put to this House by the government. So why stop now?

Yet all we have seen from the electorally decimated Labor Party is an opposition which is being deliberately obstructive. Whether it be the partial float of Telstra, which plan we went to the people with—it would have been sold in full, under the previous government, without consulting the Australian people—or the provisional tax uplift factor, which it spoke long and hard about and which it never bothered to reduce in its own time in government, it continually opposes legislation simply for the sake of opposing it.

          In general terms, there are three major criteria that form part of the point system which has been identified for the selection of immigrants: their family ties, humanitarian needs, and economic skills and resources.

Firstly, this bill arises from Liberal Party policy; it does not arise because of the consequences of 13 years of Labor government. This policy was announced by the Liberal Party in March 1993. When the honourable member suggests that this bill relates to an action of the former Labor government, it is a fallacy and it does not justify this legislation.

        The facts of the matter are that, when people apply to migrate to Australia, they have to meet the points criteria to obtain entry. The other undeniable fact is that absolutely no-one can guarantee that any individual will face two years of full&amp;hyphen;time employment without hardship, whether that hardship be the result of a work related injury, a personal illness or a family illness.

        Indeed, the honourable member for Longman cannot, in all sincerity, guarantee that he will necessarily be employed in his current occupation for a continuous period of two years.

That should not mean that the honourable member for Longman and his family should be cast into destitution as a result of those perhaps unforeseen events.

        The government has presented the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period as being merely an extension of the Labor government's 26&amp;hyphen;week waiting period. That, however, is a significant misrepresentation and it is essential to acknowledge that there is a fundamental difference between the situation faced by a person precluded from income support for a period of six months and the options available to a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         person facing a two&amp;hyphen;year preclusion period. Any form of waiting period clearly imposes a significant burden on any individual but, going from six months to two years, introduces a lot of uncertainties and many more vicissitudes that could result in an individual worker and/or his family not being able to sustain themselves albeit for some of that time, at least.

        The government's representation of its policy, contrary to the promises prior to the last election, is baseless in the sense that it has significantly moved away from merely extending the period during which the items of benefit which were included in the Labor government's six months preclusion in what it has imposed, namely, a two-year preclusion.

        So, while it may be window&amp;hyphen;dressing for the government to take away this benefit, supposedly for a saving of $600 million—more realistically, half that—the public purse will simply be required to supplement what community organisations will be forced to pick up. The fact of the matter is that these decent people in the community organisations will not let people starve; but that is no basis upon which this government is entitled to formulate its policies. There can be no doubt that this legislation will create a subclass of people in the Australian community. While under Labor every permanent resident in Australia has been able to qualify for some sort of subsidy in cases of destitution, that can no longer be guaranteed.

        The honourable member for Longman said—I am not sure whether it was in entirely justified tones—that Asian migrants to this country have a very poor understanding of the English language. I must say that that is a sweeping generalisation, significantly without foundation in my experience. Be that as it may, it must be accepted that a number of migrants coming to this country from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking countries will be at a disadvantage. The honourable member for Longman acknowledged that those people have fallen prey to unscrupulous people, whom he again generalised to be their own countrymen. That may or may not be the case; but certainly there is a substantial cash labour market which is developing, just as it has developed in the United States, which preys on migrants.

        The reality is that if a family migrating to Australia faces starvation, or if one of their children is in need of medical help and the family cannot turn to anyone—to Medicare or to social security—for such medical help, what will they do?

        The lack of assistance to migrant families—including the parents and the children—for a period of two years is going to significantly retard the opportunity that a family will have to be trained in the English language and in other essential vocational skills.

        The coalition has consistently focused on the need to protect family life. Indeed, we heard many coalition maiden speeches in which government members claimed a monopoly on reverence to the institution of the family. The coalition has, in the past, declared its commitment to the family reunion program. The coalition's two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period, as it has framed it, would severely affect the capacity of families to consider applying for residence for a family member under the family reunion program. It would expose to poverty the children of people entering Australia as permanent residents. Quite frankly, it makes a mockery of the coalition's claim to a monopoly on respect and reverence for the family unit.

        These tenets include, firstly, the genuine need for help that has to be addressed.

Next, there has to be a safety net we must always keep in place for people who, through no fault of their own, just cannot support themselves. Finally, there are the really exceptional cases of refugee and humanitarian needs.

        today reports on the catastrophic situation looming—from the study undertaken by the Red Cross—of a starvation crisis within 10 years. At present there are hunger spots in countries such as Africa, with 459.2 million people; Asia, 262.4 million people; and Latin America, 67.2 million people. When you look at the catastrophic conditions which some of those people are suffering, we would all like to say, `Yes we should provide for every one of those people.' I think everyone in this House would say that we really have a responsibility to do it, but in doing so we have to sustain the economy that we have. Some would argue that there are certain things that need changing within that economy and certain standards of living that perhaps ought to be looked at in terms of whether or not they are fair, and that—to get an across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board understanding of it all—some people should look at their own standard of living. But there are very many competing issues that have to be addressed and that issue surely is one of major proportions that we must look at.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Bearing those issues in mind, we cannot take the approach that we must address every single need. In this bill before the House the government really is introducing legislation to provide some contraction in expenditure in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         some areas, because that is for the benefit of the whole country. If the whole country is better off we will have a greater capacity perhaps to address some of the very serious issues in humanitarian and refugee areas.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is important to bear that in mind when considering what this measure is about. I think that issue is sometimes forgotten in this debate and we launch into a `them and us' approach. In other words, there is a suggestion that we on this side of the House do not really care for people who are less fortunate than us and that the people on the other side of the House care a bit more than us. I think that sometimes that political debate clouds what really should be a bipartisan approach to helping those who are in genuine need.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly this bill extends the current 26&amp;hyphen;week waiting period to two years, but there are savings measures attached to that. We must remember that those savings measures will assist the economy as a whole and will make the economy as a whole better able to provide. The consideration of this matter has to be brought back to that each time. I think there is a tendency to lose sight of that.

He learnt that particular lesson. He admitted that to me. In fact, he left the area and, as I understand it, he now practices in a middle&amp;hyphen;class area.

         With a measure like the one before the House, I would like members to think about the fact that there is not an unlimited cake. We have responsibilities in a lot of areas of this country and, I believe, having read that article this morning, in other parts of the world. If I may digress just slightly, Madam Deputy Speaker, without incurring your wrath, I hope the government thinks very hard about the aid budget and reads that particular article before coming to terms with where we are in this country.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Getting back to this measure, it is a matter of looking at the measures and looking at the situation in much poorer countries and then developing a strategy whereby, if we are going to get firmer in some areas—which we have to—we should also be looking very kindly on those much poorer areas.

         To get back to the bill, it does allow for a safety net. That should not be forgotten in the overall debate. It will not leave people in genuine need out in the cold. The member for Barton (Mr McClelland) mentioned a couple of cases such as a death in the family when the person was within the two&amp;hyphen;year period and someone was unable to earn income. The bill actually covers that particular area. If there is a tragic event like a double fatality, there is a safety net for children and others in the bill, as I understand it.

         So it is not correct to say that they are going to be left out in the cold or cast out onto the resources of the general welfare community, including private welfare agencies. It should be remembered that the initial 26&amp;hyphen;week waiting period was introduced in l992 by a previous government and took effect from 1 January l993. As I have said, the savings should not be understated. I do not pretend for one moment that the savings that are involved are massive savings, but in the context of a budget, as I understand it, our social security commitments are getting close to $1 billion every week.

          These sorts of savings will help to provide in a better way for people who need it.

The projected savings are $29 million in the coming finan cial year, $132.4 million in the following year, and $171.1 million in l998&amp;hyphen;99. There are not insubstantial savings over that period of something like $365 million. That is not an insubstantial amount over that more lengthy period.

         The element of retrospectivity, which was mentioned by my learned colleague the honourable member for Barton, is something that one has to be very careful of in any legislation. Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that, if I considered that this was a particularly serious example of retrospectivity, I would think very carefully about voting in favour of it. But there was a clear announcement made by the government in relation to the matter, and what the bill says to people who are contemplating coming here is that, instead of making provision for that 26&amp;hyphen;week period, you now must make provision for a two&amp;hyphen;year period.

I would argue very strongly against any suggestion that people are really looking to come here just to use the system. I think that most people who come to this country want to come here to start a new life and to work. So, in reality, that suggestion of retrospectivity is illusory. It means that they must take into account that extra period in planning their migration to Australia.

         I mentioned the matter of refugees. We can still perform this very important humanitarian role under the exemptions—and it is important to mention that. It is also important to mention the safety net, because there is a discretionary payment in the department. The exercise of that discretion can be monitored by the appeals tribunal. Members will know from experience that that tribunal is very independent. It is made up of very eminent people in the community. Frequently discretions by the department have miscarried. The tribunal would, I imagine, look at every case

         The suggestions that have been made by the other side, might I respectfully say, perhaps get back to the old rhetoric about `them and us', which I indicated before. I think it is important for the opposition to realise that we cannot keep going on that road. We all want to be generous, we all want to help, but there is not an unlimited supply of funds to do that. The reason why we have a national debt of something over $100 billion is that there is not this monitoring process of expenditure, and expenditure has gone haywire in recent years. We have to pull that back. This is a measure which, in my submission, is fair to all people. It is fair to the community and it shows a responsibility to the Australian people. It is the fulfilment of an election promise and it shows responsibility.

         As the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) said, he would rather this measure had not been implemented. I think that is a fair comment. Probably most of us would have preferred that. But, in reality, as part of the overall package and as part of recognising the reality of our budgetary situation, we would like to help and be more kindly disposed to all people if we could. We would like to be able to help those 700 million people out there who are hungry. But within the limits of our budgetary constraints, immediately, we are not able to do that. Let us hope that, with this measure, there is going to be a means of indicating first of all that we cannot be a repository for people whose countries are not exercising that responsibility of caring for their own people. So, we cannot be that either. But what we are trying to do by this measure, in my submission, Madam Deputy Speaker, is provide the budgetary caution that is needed at this time and fulfil our election policy commitment, but, at the same time, provide adequate safety nets for the people involved if misfortune should befall them. So, in all of the circumstances, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure to support this bill and its passage through the House.

         —I rise with a certain sadness to discuss the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill. It is very sad that it is the Howard government which has put forward this particular piece of legislation. I say that because the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is a person whom most of multicultural and ethnic Australia is observing very closely in terms of his actions with respect to the ethnic communities, migrants and the policy of multiculturalism.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reason for that, as you will know, Madam Deputy Speaker, is historical. It has to do with the history of John Howard, parliamentarian and former Leader of the Opposition, and what he attempted to do with the policies of multiculturalism and immigration in this country. It was to be hoped—and I said this on a number of occasions last year before the election—that when he made a statement a year ago that he had reformed his views on multiculturalism and immigration that he had genuinely done so; that he had recognised the hurt he had caused and the problems he had created as a parliamentarian and as a leader of the opposition at that time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, we would have expected that someone with his record, and about whom so many people in Australia's ethnic communities have concerns, would have been extremely sensitive to introducing any legislation of this kind into the parliament. Instead, in answer to questions in question time, the Prime Minister has virtually gloated about this policy. He has virtually said, `Look, we stand for this policy. We are about to cut off these rights for people in terms of extending this waiting period to two years and, if you don't like it, go out and tell the average Joe Blow about it.'

        It is obvious what the political strategy is. The approach is that they are saying, `In the mainstream media we can attack migrant communities and migrant people in this way and we can get away with it because there's a whole group of people out there that we give a message to, either directly or indirectly, either subtly or non&amp;hyphen;subtly, that we are against them. We are against the rights of
        <break page="1733" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         migrants.' That is the message which this legislation is giving. That is the message which has been given by the comments of the Prime Minister and other ministers in relation to migrant and multicultural affairs since the election of this government.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I said, it is very sad because we were led to believe that there was a different view. The situation is that this legislation is being interpreted in this way. I know it is possible to go to some ethnic groups, especially some older ethnic groups, and to find some individuals in those groups who say, `Well, we're not really concerned about this issue.' But, as a person who is very close to Australia's ethnic communities and who has been for many years, I must say that people are very concerned about this, especially members of the newly arrived communities whose relatives are going to be most affected by this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Until recently, Madam Deputy Speaker, we had a principle in this country that people's relatives had a certain priority in our immigration program. This whole idea of migration of relatives has been a factor in our migration program for virtually 30 years. What are we doing to this factor now? We are effectively introducing an element which will discriminate. It will discriminate between those people who are in wealthy circumstances—circumstances where they can afford to maintain their relatives in Australia—and those people who are not in that situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This kind of discriminatory situation also results, and this is a very important point, in actual outcomes which are discriminatory in terms of sources of migration. It is true to say that there are people coming from one country who are significantly poorer and in a significantly different situation than those coming from other countries. So although it is not the intention of the policy, the consequence will be that family reunion migration will end up effectively supporting one group of countries vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis another. We will get into a situation which, although it may be an unintended consequence, will lead to complaints from particular communities that they are not getting a fair deal in relation to the family reunion program.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have already put a number of controls into the family reunion program. One of the things that really disturbs me is the lack of effort by members of parliament, and I blame everybody in this situation, to explain to the Australian people exactly what has been going on in the area of migration and especially family migration. Myths are everywhere. There are people who think that people arrive automatically under family reunion, or as refugees, and have no obligations. They do not pass any tests. They do not pass any criteria. They just happen to come here whereas, as you know, we have had a situation in this country for a number of years, certainly during the whole period of the Labor government, where tough criteria were used in terms of the individuals able to come on extended family migration.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Of course, this did not apply for spouses. At one point some people went so far as to suggest that we should limit spouse immigration, not even recognising that this would create a situation where we were in contradiction with fundamental principles of human rights as declared by the United Nations. Imagine a situation where a person's spouse would be affected in this way. But the basic point is that family reunion migration will be severely affected by this provision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         A further point is that this extension to the two&amp;hyphen;year period is being done in a way which the current government, in opposition and during the election campaign, did not indicate was their intention. As the shadow minister has said, the reality is that the original proposal was a simple extension of the former Labor government's six months waiting period. No statement was made beyond that. No statement was made that the criteria would change, those receiving the benefits would change and those not receiving the benefits would change. It was put to us that there would be a simple extension of that principle.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         And what has happened? We find that the criteria have been significantly widened so that other forms of benefits are affected which were not indicated in any of the statements made by the coalition during the election campaign. For example, the then shadow minister, Jim Short, said this:

          The coalition's proposal to extend the six months period to two years is simply an extended application of a principle established by Labor in 1993.

          But it is not only an extension in terms of the number of benefits that will be cut off; it is also an extension in terms of the number of people and the groups of people that will be affected. We now find, Madam Deputy Speaker, that even spouses are going to be affected. Can you believe that? The situation will be that a person's spouse will be affected by this legislation. A spouse will not be given the same rights. In other words, if an Australian citizen goes overseas and marries someone, who comes over here—not for the purpose of general immigration, but for the purpose of being with their spouse—what do we have in that context? We have a situation where they will be subjected to the cutting off of all benefits, including medical benefits. If that person's spouse happens to become ill in that two&amp;hyphen;year period, even though the Australian spouse may actually be paying the Medicare levy and paying taxation, that person will be affected in terms of the spouse's claims for Medicare benefits.

          So we have the absurd situation that even a person in the most intimate relationship—the person who has to come to be with their partner in this country—is going to be affected by this cut&amp;hyphen;off. Even if the Australian spouse happens to be working, happens to be paying taxes and happens to be paying the Medicare levy, their spouse will be affected. What kind of message is that supposed to send in terms of the Liberals' much touted support for the family? I am not sure. It obviously shows that they support the family, except when it comes to migrants, when it comes to spouses of migrants and when it comes to anything else that suits their purposes in terms of significant cuts to the budget.

           If people come here as refugees and they want to bring their relatives here, what is going to happen to the relatives of the refugees? They are not refugees; they are relatives of refugees. Are they not entitled to make a claim on the family reunion program? Of course they are. Previously they would have made that claim. Now the situation is that we have a person who is a refugee. That person may be coming here and establishing a life in Australia. They want to have a relative of theirs here. They sponsor that relative to come here. The refugee, the original sponsor, becomes unemployed for some reason. Maybe that person has worked for six months after arriving here but suddenly loses their job. The relative will not be eligible at any period in the two years for those benefits.

          So what does this say about the fundamental Australian idea of fairness? Obviously, it says that, when it comes to the conservative parties and their cutting exercises, you can forget about it. Indeed, as I said in a speech last week, when it comes to the concept of social justice and the concept of fairness, we are seeing increasingly that the conservative parties are bringing back the New Right agenda. The agenda that they told us was forgotten about—the Fightback agenda, the Thatcherite agenda—is all coming back. They are bringing that back and doing great damage to other people. In fact, we have only seen the beginning of the process.

          As we go towards the budget we are going to see other vulnerable groups of people attacked. I do not mean just the migrant communities—although you can be sure there will be more attacks on them and more migrant programs will be cut. The other vulnerable groups of people—the poorer sectors of the population, people who cannot defend themselves, people who rely on the government for welfare services—will be affected as we go towards the budget. What is the excuse—the justification—for this? As was proven conclusively today, it is nothing more than a myth created by the conservative parties who were not even prepared to wait until the growth figures came out—

They could hardly wait to create this myth—the claim about this so&amp;hyphen;called $8 billion hole—in order to abandon all of the moderate proposals that they put before the election and to get back to the New Right, Thatcherite agenda. And they think that the Australian people are going to swallow it. They think the Australian people are going to believe them when they say, `We have to make these cuts because we have got to achieve fiscal balance.' In fact, the fiscal situation is much better than they claim and they have created a mythology in order to be able to bring in the agenda they always intended to have. As I mentioned, the Prime Minister should have been particularly careful in this area because of his record over the years. This is a cut that certainly should not be made in this way.

          The government claims a mandate for the increase in waiting time to two years. But it has no mandate for the increase in the number of benefits to be cut or for increasing the number of groups that are going to be affected. It has no mandate for either of those proposals and the opposition will oppose both of them. And we are correct in opposing both of them because what is being put in place is inhumane as well as contradictory. You will have a situation whereby, for example, if a migrant arrives in Australia under the family reunion scheme, gets a job and pays the Medicare levy and then pays taxation, they will not be able to claim the additional family payment. Can you believe that? A person who performs all their functions in Australia, including employment, will not be able to claim the additional family payment for their children. What sort of a nonsense is this?

          The reality is that this is nothing more than an extensive cost saving measure which has the side effect, as I mentioned, of sending the message to the mainstream Australian community that `a little bit of migrant belting here and there will do us a lot of good out in a few electorates.' That is a disgraceful political position and one which has to be reversed. Those members of the government parties who understand multicultural issues and who believe genuinely in the rights of migrants ought to be opposing these provisions and ought to continue to oppose these provisions. In fact, these provisions should never have gone through the conservative party rooms.

          I conclude with this point: we are at a crossroad in this country. The media have suggested that, because two or three members were elected by taking what one might call a very negative position on race and multicultural issues, somehow there is an overwhelming reaction against the idea of multiculturalism, against the idea of migrant rights, and against the idea of fairness for our ethnic communities in Australia. Let me say that a big mistake is being made by those who suppose that this is the case.

        There are a number of reasons why an incoming government would want to make the changes in the legislation before the House. One of the concerns constantly expressed by those people who have the privilege of working with migrant community groups is the uneven approach that is taken by people coming to Australia. The fact is that some are willing to take the benefits of Australia, no matter what the circumstances and no matter what their claims. In fact, one is led at times to believe that people come to Australia to take advantage of our welfare
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         benefits, despite the responsibilities of sponsors and the undertakings given by them.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In more cases than not—and the member at the table (Dr Theophanous) knows those statistics—the guarantees given by sponsors are overturned and denied. They are not followed through. This is a measure to correct that process. The former government saw the difficulty and itself put a six&amp;hyphen;month period in. Where was the bleeding from the member for Calwell at that point? I did not hear one comment from him. I did not read of the honourable member in the ethnic press and I did not hear him on radio or television complaining about his government when it took that dreadful step of putting in place a six&amp;hyphen;month barrier to the claim of welfare benefits for newly arrived migrants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, as soon as the opposing parties extend and rationalise and make a very sensible decision along the same themes and along the same pathway already taken by his own party in government, he complains. There are some extremely good reasons why we should undertake these decisions as we have. I would, however, in the process of supporting these proposals, point out to the House the rationale for the decisions. Migrants who come to Australia should be prepared, in our view, to be able to support themselves for two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that everybody who is concerned about the employment prospects of newly arrived migrants is concerned that we must be selecting to come here those who can play a full and a proper role in our society, who can gain employment, make a contribution to this nation and gain benefits for themselves and their families. So it is a proper thing in our view that newly arrived migrants should be prepared to support themselves for at least up to two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many migrants who enter Australia have a sponsor or an assurer who has agreed to support them. That is part of the settlement process that has been adopted since, I believe, the mid-1970s, when ease of settlement was linked with the person whom you linked up with on arrival. That proposal does not go without some responsibility. Some migrants are granted visas on the basis that they can
        <break page="1737" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         support themselves. There is often an unfair treatment in my view of the independent migrant who comes here with high knowledge and high skills but has to jump a higher barrier than those with a family sponsorship. This proposal levels the playing field in the way that it applies to both those who are sponsored or not sponsored. They will have to be prepared to look after themselves for a two-year period.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Newly arrived migrants should not expect immediate access to social security. That was the very fact that the Australian Labor Party had made. We have increased the waiting period for eligibility for social security and we have extended the range of those benefits that will be denied to newly arrived migrants. Of course, however, it would be unconscionable for us to apply those conditions to the humanitarian or refugee category. Australia has obligations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and we will continue to fulfil those responsibilities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The House will be aware that there is an extended range of benefits that will be denied to those who come to Australia. But there are also some exceptions that I think the House needs to be aware of. Some of the rantings and ravings, some of the extravagant claims being made by those opposite about the harshness of these conditions, should be put in the context of some of those areas where there can be exceptions. I draw the attention of the House to the statements made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), which set out the criteria for access of special benefits during the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period and the circumstances under which people can gain access to special benefits.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You would recognise if you were frank with the House that some of the conditions have a sense of fairness about them. There is toughness, but there is fairness for those in real need. I will just read to the House a couple of those circumstances that can apply to individuals if something goes wrong. Special benefits are available to newly arrived migrants if the sponsor becomes unemployed or if the migrants are receiving job search or newstart allowances. That is fair. If the sponsor is declared a bankrupt, benefits may
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         be available. If the sponsor is imprisoned or enters a psychiatric institution or a nursing home on a long-term basis, if the sponsor has been reported to the police as a missing person and the police have been unable to locate them, if the sponsor leaves Australia permanently, or if the sponsor dies, then special benefits are available to the newly arrived migrant. I think that takes into account just about every situation where a sponsor cannot fulfil their obligation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) would probably think that that is probably erring on the side of being a bit too fair. I understand the way in which he approaches this issue, he being a migrant himself—he has quite different attitudes from those expressed by the member at the table who, in government, denied benefits to people but when in opposition wants to give migrants everything. That is rather typical of the approach of the Australian Labor Party—make extravagant promises and claims when they are in opposition but not fulfil them when they are in government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If migrants are sponsored by a business or employer there are certain circumstances whereby they can still gain benefits: if the job is withdrawn after the person arrived in Australia, if the business goes into receivership and the migrant's employment is terminated, if a business ceases to operate during the migrant's first two years in Australia, or the worker is retrenched. What is fairer for the availability of special benefits than that? For a worker who is sponsored there is still that opportunity if something goes wrong with the job—if the job is withdrawn, the business goes into receivership, the business ceases to operate or the worker is retrenched.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that is fair enough, and people on this side think that that is fair enough. The member for Calwell does not think it is fair enough. He wants them to have it come hell or high water—come into Australia and fill your pockets up with the taxpayers' funds and the funds of people who are battling trying to find jobs.

Within a month of their arriving, he had pleaded changed circumstances.

         —As I was saying, the theme of the coalition's election campaign was `For all of us'. Now we have seen this social security bill, we know when the coalition says `For all of us' the coalition really means `For some of us'. The effects of this bill give the lie to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) because what this bill does is deliberately make Australia a less attractive proposition for prospective migrants. It deliberately undermines our enviable reputation. It deliberately dismantles the fabric of a society that the Prime Minister has acknowledged is tolerant and compassionate.

        Let us have a look at what the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions, most recently in his talk to ACOSS last Friday, I think it was. In that talk to ACOSS last Friday, he reiterated the commitments he made to ACOSS on 13 October 1995 in a speech called `Fair Australia'. In that speech he said:

But if you are a less wealthy family, a family on a low income, who could do with some extra help to feed, clothe and house children, then according to this government, according to this bill, bad luck.

        A little later on in the speech we might have expected to hear a bit about the provisions in this bill because there is a segment in this speech to ACOSS where Mr Howard spoke about people from non-English speaking backgrounds.

         Now we hear that labour market programs, as well as all the other things in this bill, are under threat. In a letter to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), the Prime Minister said:

        <para font-size="-=2">

        <para>
        </para>
        <para>
         What we see here in this bill is not the end of the road. These are not the only things that newly arrived migrants are going to find themselves excluded from. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister said to ACOSS last year that vocational skills are needed to fully participate in the labour market, there will be no help from the government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Prime Minister went on to say that the coalition is committed to policies that will ensure that newly arrived migrants, particularly refugees, have access to retraining and language courses. How can we believe that now that we also know that this bill exists, that Austudy and labour market programs are likely to be excluded and that the Prime Minister has also asked the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) to look at whether child&amp;hyphen;care assistance and the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate should also be excluded from access by new migrants? We have a major effort by this government to remove what this side of the House considers basic support for people newly arrived in this country.

         Let us look at another document in which we might have found reference to these new exclusions. A document called `A social security safety net' was the Liberal-National parties' social security policy. There we have mention of people with disabilities, widows, carers and families. There is also a section on people of non-English speaking background and reciprocal agreements with other countries. But nowhere in this document is there any mention whatsoever of a two-year waiting period. That is the first thing. Secondly, there is absolutely no mention under any of those headings of people with disabilities, widows,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          carers or families—no mention whatsoever that new migrants to this country will have to wait two years for access to any of those payments. In none of those areas where commitments to payments are set out is there anything about new migrants.

         In the section on reciprocal agreements with other countries there is no mention that the then opposition intended, if they won government, to dramatically alter the conditions that would apply to new migrants in this country. As the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) said in his speech to this bill, this is a very bad piece of legislation—one that will certainly not add to social cohesiveness in this country.

No doubt if he did more reading in that field he could find articles about the Victorian furnishing trades and their problems with Chinese labour, but he could also find comments by Cecil Rhodes and Winston Churchill. Quite frankly, I think anyone with half a historical bent would appreciate that these comments are often made in different contexts, different historical periods, and they should be seen in that way.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I am perhaps more interested in the current context and the forces that drive this legislation. They are epitomised in the Governor-General's speech on behalf of the government. The rhetoric of that speech is what really propels this legislation. It said:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        The government's commitment to govern in the national interest, and not for vested interests, will build community confidence and respect for the rights of all Australians.

        All the measures and policies so far described are aimed at promoting the interests of the Australian community as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is really behind that is the reality that there is in the Australian electorate at the moment a very hard edge in this policy area. To be honest, the previous government to some degree vacated the field by a preoccupation with multiculturalism without explaining a large number of measures that it had under
        <break page="1744" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         taken in this field. I will go through some of those.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These things should have been indicated more firmly in the previous three years. I agree with the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) that all members have a duty to explain the policy, to explain what is going on. There was a failure to really articulate to the Australian electorate that it is not a free-for-all, that it is not just a matter of walking through the door and getting benefits.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we look to the history of the last few years we see that in 1989 the previous government increased the emphasis on the English language and the points test to ensure that there was some targeting of the migration intake, that it was not just anyone's cousin who left school at six years of age and looked after sheep on a mountain. They introduced the health levy and the bond to ensure the recovery of welfare benefits paid to some sponsored family reunion migrants. So the government did move in the direction of sponsorship, getting money at the initial entry. There was the introduction of user pays in sectors of English language instruction. There was, as many have said, the introduction of this six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The reality, unknown to the Australian electorate, has been the introduction of a number of measures to try to ensure that there was some legitimacy in the system, that it was not, as the current government tried to pitch it in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election, essentially a situation of bludging on the Australian taxpayers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt about the reality out there in the electorates. In places like my own electorate, there are the families of former Maltese poultry workers, the second generation Lebanese who work at James Hardy, the Turkish shopkeepers in Auburn and the people who came here in the 1920s without any expectation that they could bring their families here. Those people are concerned.

        There must be a reappraisal of the migrant intake. There must be an attempt to ensure that migration in this country is driven by this country's population requirements and long-term needs rather than by lobby groups, which some people might feel should dictate

         the direction we take. There should also be an even greater emphasis on bonds before people arrive. These are the solutions we should be looking at. It is interesting to note that, whilst there is a possibility of requiring bonds for spouse entry, the latest figures indicate that a bond is required for only six per cent of prospective spouses. These are areas where something can be done to make sure there is legitimacy in the system, to make sure Australian taxpayers can have respect for the system, to make sure migration is not undermined by its lack of respectability.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This matter is driven by politics, and the opposition does have a number of concerns with this legislation. Firstly, there is the issue of retrospectivity. It is quite clear from Senator Newman's statements that a number of people—probably significant numbers—who have already been approved will be affected by this. The conservative parties in this country usually have a great passion for this issue. There is great passion by the current minister for what we might be doing to illegal entrants to this country. On 28 February 1995, in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are reluctant converts in relation to this matter. We opposed the bill on the last occasion because of its retrospectivity. The bill is still retrospective in its impact. We took an on balance decision, taking into account a number of matters, particularly the potential cost to the public purse . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We had to drag those opposite screaming to support that legislation because it was retrospective. That legislation was not aimed at people who had entered the country illegally; it was aimed at protecting the Australian taxpayer from very large compensation payments for supposed illegal detention. Further, the minister bemoaned the fact that the legislation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . condones the proposition that wherever unlawful administrative action has been taken the parliament may by a retrospective initiative cure it.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Acceptance of this proposition would, as the Law Council of Australia says, destroy or at least significantly diminish the Commonwealth administrative law system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The minister is on the record as saying what a dreadful concept retrospectivity is. In that case he was crying tears for the people who
        <break page="1745" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         had been detained by the Australian legal system for illegal entry into the country. We do not see those same tears today when he retrospectively hits a large number of families who went through the migration processes required by this country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the opposition has concerns with the way in which this measure has been extended. As I said earlier, there is a view in the electorate—fashioned by the inability of people to articulate what has been happening in the last few years in regard to our laws, to explain the tightening of requirements—that severe measures have to be taken. This is not driven by any attempt to worry about what will be saved or to really look at the way in which people will be hit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If there was ever any evidence as to what was behind this, it was the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We know what he said at Queanbeyan. We know he gave the commitment that this measure would not affect a wide range of benefits. We know the way in which it has gradually been extended to cover Austudy, Medicare and family payments, et cetera. It is interesting to note that, on 21 May, when he was first asked about this in the parliament, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it was my understanding when I wrote that letter that it was completely consonant with the commitment that had been made.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was quite clear on 21 May that he was considering adherence to and integrity and honesty about the commitment the government made before the election. Overnight, he obviously reconsidered the political situation. The next day he was able to say that he `makes no apology whatever for making a policy change'. It was a matter of great moment when this man went to the Australian electorate with these rather high standards in Australian politics and said that he never lies or deceives. In this policy area he decided to take the opportune possibilities to extend the mandate to a large number of other benefits. This legislation, retrospective in its nature, is providing an inadequate safety net, extending to a range of payments far more diverse than those the coalition had originally spoken of. As other speakers have noted, a more diverse range of people have been covered.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Longman talked about the experience of relations who got jobs easily. The reality in this country is that over the last decade it has been difficult to get employment. People complain about others getting benefits. The reality is that the Australian electorate as a whole was not getting these benefits in the 1940s. It is not just a matter of benefits being extended to new arrivals. We are talking about a different reality for all Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a matter of concern that this measure is going to hit people, and I will detail that in a few moments. There is a wide variety of articles that go to the question of the impact of our current economic situation on new arrivals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Again, I want to join with those other members who have accentuated the way in which there has been deception about savings. Despite the blowing of horns and the wild projections of what was going to be saved through this measure, in reality the savings have been roughly half of what was originally forecast. That is a pretty wide difference. As I indicated, there has to be a lot more targeting in the program. As far as I am concerned, there is nothing wrong with giving a degree of national interest greater prominence in this program, and, at the same time, having a reasonably high refugee intake.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is going to impact on people who have already been given permission to come to this country. What is the situation they face? Janet Taylor and Helen Macdonald, of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, noted in an article entitled `Disadvantaged children of immigrants: a longitudinal study':
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The need to ensure adequate wage levels for all workers, in particular NESB workers, in the face of economic restructuring is highlighted by the number of NESB families in the Life Chances Study with incomes below the poverty line despite the parents' employment.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
         The study confirms the concerns . . . about the relative under&amp;hyphen;representation of children of NESB families among recipients of Additional Family Payment for low wage earners and raises questions about how this payment can best be advertised in non-English families.

         That indicates the severe problems that people coming to this country without English, without skills, without recognition of skills obtained overseas and without networks already in employment face when they go into areas like my own electorate. In places like that they do not have these networks, and there has been a retraction of manufacturing employment. Even when they get employment, they are basically condemned to the worst jobs in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Centre for International Economics in 1992, in the document `Immigration and the Commonwealth budget', noted:

         It finds that in the first one to two years, assuming normal `non-recessionary' labour market conditions, the intake marginally increases the budget deficit, by a total of $57 million. But under depressed labour market condition assumptions, this deficit rises to $208 million. Over a three&amp;hyphen; to four&amp;hyphen;year term the deficit increase is $139 million in total under normal labour market conditions . . . After ten years, the net contribution of the intake is $317 million surplus.
        </para>
        <para>
         What most studies in this country have shown is that the first three to five years of arrival are characterised by an over&amp;hyphen;representation in unemployment, particularly of communities such as Turks, Arabs and Vietnamese, but that their employment levels become closer to the Australian mainstream over time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Essentially, what we are going to do with these people is condemn them even further. We are going to ensure that, whilst the government gets rid of the assistance to the textile workers enduring outwork in this country, these people—people who have been deprived of their benefits for two years—are going to be forced into that marketplace. The member for Longman talks about the fact that a lot of these people do not have English and therefore people in their communities persuade them to go and outwork. The previous government had policies in place to attempt to undermine outwork and the way it was eroding migrants' conditions in this country. This government is going to force these people into these kinds of areas, and that is a clear reality.

         —The policy basis of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill is bad. It raises some fundamental questions. One question is whether this government accepts multiculturalism as the basis of our society. The attacks on new arrivals that this bill would encourage indicate that the government does not. Another question is whether the government accepts its obligations to ensuring that the disadvantaged in our community receive proper protection. Again, the bill indicates that the government feels it is under no obligation.

        The bill before the House is based on a punitive approach to politics and comes straight out of Fightback. Let me quote from that infamous document. It says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The coalition will not permit future migrants access to benefits for two years after they first arrive, unless they are given refugee or humanitarian entry status.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the sake of proper attribution, that quote can be found in chapter 16, on page 289. At the time of the last election, the coalition policy read:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Access to welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants will be available after two years under a coalition government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let there be no doubt about it: this policy comes straight out of the most pernicious manifesto ever put before the Australian people. Now we have found it regurgitated in this bill. It is not about ensuring that sponsors fulfil their obligations; it is about putting obstacles in the way of people seeking to come to this country, hoping to discourage them altogether.

        This government is actually proposing to be more punitive in its approach than Dr Hewson was. If you look at Fightback, it states:

        Last week we saw, as a result of leaked correspondence, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has insisted that what was the family allowance supplement will not be available in that two&amp;hyphen;year period following arrival. Let us be clear: what John Hewson was prepared to give, John Howard will not. Not only does
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         this policy make a comeback from Fightback, but also the new version is decidedly more sinister than the original.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has been manufacturing a fiction that this measure is all about cutting out welfare for migrants; the leaked correspondence exposes this fiction. The family allowance supplement is paid to those in employment. These people are not getting off the plane and onto welfare—they are low&amp;hyphen;paid workers. Like all low&amp;hyphen;paid workers in this country, they deserve the protection of the social safety net.
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         How does this fit in with the Prime Minister's commitment to no worker being worse off?

       <para first-indent="16">
        Newly arrived migrants in employment and on low wages now face the double injustice of no family payments and the proposed changes to the industrial relations system. This group of workers is definitely worse off. As we saw in studies of the new enterprise bargaining arrangements towards the end of last year, it is migrant workers who need special assistance to ensure that they get the same gains as the rest of the work force. One consequence of the measure will be to place further strain on the already overstretched resources of the emergency relief programs. Newly arrived migrants who are denied access to the social security system and other programs of income support will increasingly turn to emergency relief programs. Anecdotal reports from service providers in my electorate indicate that this has already begun.

        The significance of this bill reaches far beyond those it purports to target; it would affect Australian citizens too. Let us assume an Australian citizen is married to a citizen of another country and that they reside in that country with their children. After returning to Australia, the children must wait the two&amp;hyphen;year period before they are able to qualify for full family payment. This situation where Australian citizens are unable to have access to family payments arises out of the proposed measure. This is certainly the most bizarre outcome.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is speculation that the introduction of these measures was designed to reduce demand for preferential family migration. It was hoped that restricting the availability of these
        <break page="1749" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         benefits would lower demand by some 10 per cent over a full financial year. Since the announcement of these measures, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is said to have experienced no reduction in demand for spouse migration, so this bill will not achieve this aim. It ends up punishing a group which is already among the most exposed in our community.

        These cuts were supposed to mean projected savings in the budget of some $616 million over three years. Even with the inclusion of a whole host of other programs, only $332&amp;half; million over three years would be saved. It is therefore legitimate to ask where the difference of $283.5 million will be made up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What other pernicious measures does the government have in store for migrants in order to recoup this amount? Where are these savings going to be made within the portfolio and which group will be singled out for this treatment next time? This measure is indeed short&amp;hyphen;sighted and callous. It will undoubtedly create more problems than it seeks to solve. The government fails to take into account the fact that it is consigning a proportion of the Australian community to severe hardship.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The supposed savings to the budget are nothing compared with the long&amp;hyphen;term damage done. The Australian community will have to deal with the enormous drain on emergency relief services and charities resulting from this legislation. The Australian community will have to deal with long&amp;hyphen;term structural problems through the creation of a permanent underclass of newly arrived migrants. The long&amp;hyphen;term costs to the budget and to Australia appear to outweigh any short&amp;hyphen;term gain. Ultimately, relegating new arrivals to this underclass only undermines Australia's tolerance for absorbing people through a program of immigration. None of these things can be good for Australia.

        In this debate various speakers have indicated other particularly disturbing aspects of the way in which this legislation has been presented. I for one would like to place on record my disquiet in that here we have a piece of legislation that was first introduced late last Thursday before the House adjourned
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         for the weekend break. The debate has been resumed today and then, for the second time in the first four weeks of sittings, there has been an extension of time beyond 8 o'clock on a Wednesday night.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This extension has been brought in to rush this piece of legislation through. This, I believe, is quite extraordinary, given that the government supposedly made a commitment to ensure that this place would work in what they regarded as a better, more efficient manner and that, in fact, we would be given the opportunity as a parliament to properly review the executive. I do not believe that the action being taken with this piece of legislation is in that spirit.

        Also, I found it interesting to read the communique of the meeting of the Ministerial Council of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs held in Canberra on 17 May 1996. That communique, on page 2, amongst all the issues that were discussed at the meeting, states that other issues discussed at the meeting were:

        I thank the members of the House for coming in and making a quorum so quickly. As I was saying, one of the disturbing aspects of this debate is that the minister, in the second reading speech, has not gone on in any fashion to talk about a package—and I quote again from the communique from the meeting of the ministerial council—`which addresses broader issues including immigration procedures, sponsorship responsibilities and employment opportunities'.

        In my electorate, the North East Region Settlement Issues Network had a meeting and put together a number of concerns that they have about this piece of legislation. I thought it might be appropriate to quote some of those concerns from a letter that they have sent to me. The letter states:

        Other speakers, especially those on the other side and the one Independent member who entered this debate, also raised this point in the debate: there is a targeting on the group that we are talking about here, new migrants, as if they carry out wholesale, 100 per cent, abuse of social security—100 per cent abuse of working on the side. I think that this is a nonsense. Nowhere in the debate, not in the second reading speech or in anything that I have read outside this chamber, has that been placed on record. All this is doing is attempting to try to put a lid on a group of people, to try to prevent and discourage them from entering Australia. In fact, in the main, they basically enter Australia for family reunion.

        During the last parliament, how many times did we hear the cry that a measure that was being introduced by the then government was legislation by press release?
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What have we seen in this case? On 1 April, the announcement was made by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, about the new access arrangements for social security for migrants from 1 April. Whilst some of the measures contained in this legislation form part of the policies that the coalition went to the people on, what they did not indicate—beyond saying that they would happen soon after their election—was when the start&amp;hyphen;up date would be.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As has been indicated by other members from the opposition side, there were plenty of people who would have held valid visas to come to Australia; who would have been making their arrangements. These arrangements would not have been made in the short term because, as a previous speaker said, they are arrangements of some moment—disposing of housing, disposing of goods, arranging for the proper transition for any children, arranging a family's education and the like. These are things that need long lead&amp;hyphen;in times. It is completely unfair that over the space of a short election campaign, during which this policy was announced, and then soon after the election of this government, this arbitrary date, 1 April, was implemented. That is wrong. It is quite unfair and unconscionable that it was, in fact, contained in this legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have said, I have great disquiet about the policy on which this legislation is based, particularly the fact that this present government has taken those benefits that the previous government had put a six-month waiting list on and has increased the waiting list to two years. Even given the disquiet about that element of it, it is quite incredible for the
        <break page="1751" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government to then expand the number of benefits that this proposal is to cover and to expand the groups of people that it covers.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That aspect has been addressed in the second reading amendment of the member for Denison (Mr Kerr). We believe there is a great element of deceit in the way in which the government has gone about this piece of legislation. In fact, they are matters that we believe should be taken away from this place and looked at again. The second reading amendment says that the waiting period will be extended to new groups of citizens and residents—they have been outlined previously in the debate. The legislation extends the waiting period to a wider range of new benefits entitlements. During the election campaign, the Prime Minister is on the record as saying that this new range of benefits entitlements would not be involved. Since the election, he has asked his ministers who have carriage of this area to have look at widening them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The simple fact is that we cannot even be convinced that the measures that are in this legislation will be the end of it. There is every indication that other benefits will be looked at and that other benefits will be denied to new migrants. Nothing has been said, by way of answers to questions in this place or by way of contributions in the debate, that could give us any idea other than that these are the facts.

        I read that out because when I read the bill as presented by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) I could not help but recollect that something like three years ago—it was during the 1993 election campaign—the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, made a speech in which he stated quite clearly his and, as we thought at the time, all Australians' objections to those who would work against fairness and injustice in our society. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Today we stand against radical right wing proposals which are hostile to fundamental beliefs and Australian institutions and all that we have achieved in recent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        He made these comments during a time when Australia was under threat from the then opposition's Fightback policy, a manifesto in which the members of the coalition, many of whom remain with us today, sought to transform Australia by their own meanness. They were rejected outright in 1993. The Australian people chose not to inherit the mercenary and selfish society dreamt up by the former member for Wentworth, Dr Hewson, and his close henchmen at the time—the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith),
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition then went back to their blackboard—they went back and stirred their cauldron—and by the time of the 1996 election they had a new plan. The present Prime Minister and his team had seemingly deferred to the wishes of the Australian people as exercised at the ballot box in 1993. They returned as a caring, sharing bunch who abhorred injustice in our society. They appealed to the people to forget Fightback, to forget the previous evils; they, like many previous reformed offenders, deserved a second chance. The Australian people obviously believed what they heard. The rest is now a matter of history.

        Since assuming the role of opposition in the parliament, the Australian Labor Party has declared its intention to keep the government to its election promises. While we are sure that the government's proposed two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period will generally be detrimental to the welfare of our migrants and against the spirit of fair play expected by the majority of Australian people, we do not intend to oppose the legislation in that respect. We object to, and will oppose until our last breath, the government straying from its election commitment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will stand against the backdoor approach of crucifying migrants on a scale not announced before the election. We will oppose the instigation of policy by stealth. We will resist the government's attempts at constructing the mean and wretched society that it envisaged three years ago when in opposition and on which grounds the government is now facing the Australian people. I would like to read something that others may have read in part before:

        That statement was made by the present Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs when debating the Fightback policy in this House on 5 May 1992. How little things have changed. He was then, as he is now, in
        <break page="1753" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         charge of coalition immigration policy, only now he is in government. He later said in the House on that same topic:

        That was said on 12 October 1992. So here we have in this House tonight, in this bill, the real reason behind the government's two&amp;hyphen;year waiting ban. It was the same reason then as it is now—to cut as far as possible, without creating controversy, the numbers of migrants arriving in Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The Prime Minister and the Treasurer can go on as much as they like about cutting costs or even lifting burdens from our social security system, but that is really all they want. The Prime Minister in August 1992 said it himself when asked on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Lateline
        </emphasis>
        program about Dr Hewson's plan to dramatically cut the migrant intake to 50,000. Mr Howard replied:

       <para>
        He is now so very close to realising his long&amp;hyphen;cherished dream.The Prime Minister knows that extending the waiting period to two years would not be enough on its own. Short of coming out and reducing the numbers outright in the migrant intake, such a regulation would do little to stem the flow. For example, chain migration—migration relating to and resulting from family links—is notoriously difficult to control and it will not be reduced by simply increasing the waiting period by 1&amp;half; years. The government had to find a way to bring to fruition its plans to reduce the migrant intake. It found it in the level of benefits, welfare and otherwise, which it could withhold from migrants during the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period to which they would now be subjected.

         and, I imagine, even deeper than those foreseen by any member of the government, apart from the Prime Minister and his little inner circle. The Prime Minister's words, and the words of his former shadow minister for immigration, the Assist ant Treasurer (Senator Short), before the election were clear. They said the coalition's policy on waiting periods for migrants was exactly the same as Labor's, the only difference being the extension of time from six months to two years. Let me read to government members the words that came from their own leaders' mouths, just in case they needed reminding. They said:

        Thank you Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short. That is from your press release of 19 February 1996. If the government was going to keep its promise and if the Prime Minister was going to live up to his word—which I think most Australians would expect him to—the stated policy of the coalition would have the government applying the two&amp;hyphen;year waiting period to the following benefits: jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance, youth training allowance, parenting allowance and sickness allowance. These are all benefits to which the current six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period, brought in by the Labor government, applies.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced in his second reading speech last week the government's amendments, they applied to a whole raft of benefits not included under the present act. Here we begin to appreciate the government's real agenda of cutting migrant numbers and here we have a very serious breach of an election promise.

        For the edification of those members who may have missed the speech by the minister for immigration last week, let me tell you what extra benefits the government's new waiting period will now ban migrants from: carer pension, mature age allowance, partnering allowance, disability wage supplement, widow allowance, maternity allowance, mobility allowance, special benefits other than when a migrant's circumstances change beyond their control, double orphan pension and child disability allowance.

        The Prime Minister went so far as to say exactly the same thing in this House just a day before the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs inadvertently trapped him in his deceit. The Prime Minister said, `Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition that you introduced a six-month period. All we have done is to extend your six months to two years.' Thank you, Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister's deception goes even further than that. He says one thing in question time and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs says something completely different in the House the following day. It involves a deception of the Australian people of a much higher order.

        While the Prime Minister was in this House publicly stating just how far his government's policy would go, he knew that earlier in the month he had sent letters to both the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs  (Senator Vanstone), proposing that those ministers find further benefits from which to bar migrants access. He even hinted at a couple of his own. The Prime Minister suggested to the Minister for Social Security that she look at denying migrants access to family payments within their first two years.

         I really appreciate members of the government coming in to the House so I can remind them of what their Prime Minister has said, `I make it clear—I'm not going to break any promises.'

         It should not surprise the House that the Treasurer's numbers on how much the two-year waiting period and its ban on benefits will save the government are incorrect. In his pre&amp;hyphen;election costings, the Treasury projected savings of $616 million over three years. Yet, despite widening the range of benefits to be excluded and despite including groups in their plans who were never before subject to the waiting period, such as married partners of long-term Australian residents, the explanatory memorandum circulated by Senator Newman and tabled by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs when he introduced the bill last week shows that these measures will save only $332.5 million over three years, leaving a shortfall of $283.5 million. Again why am I not surprised?

         So the government's changes cannot be a cost&amp;hyphen;cutting measure, because the figures do not add up. They are, of course, a cleverly disguised number cutting measure. On top of this you will have added costs to the Commonwealth down the line. The government obviously has not considered the hardship and depravation the changes will force upon new migrants, already among the most vulnerable in our society, and how they will create social welfare problems in the future.
         <break page="1755" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Quite likely, the money the government saves now will be lost down the line, perhaps to an even greater extent. Migrants, with the rug pulled out from under them by the government, will be forced to rely on the generosity of welfare organisations—organisations which already rely on Commonwealth funding and will perhaps need extra assistance from the government in order to meet extra demand.

         —As a new member to this place, I am finding this debate more fascinating than I thought I possibly could. I am fascinated with this debate because the level of deception that has been woven on the Australian community by the policy decision taken by this government in relation to the amendment to this bill is just appalling. I cannot believe that this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and this government based their whole election campaign on honesty and forward thinking in terms of their presentation to the community. They said to the community, `We disagree with the way the country has been governed to the point where we are going to do something totally different. We are going to set a whole new

        Honourable members have heard much of this before, but it is so important that it is said again and again on the public record so that people really understand what this government is about. On 19 February this year the then shadow minister for immigration, Jim Short, said:

        Prime Minister Howard—our new, honest Prime Minister—gave a personal pledge when he was visiting St Gregory's Primary School in Queanbeyan not so long ago that the increase in the waiting period would not apply to refugees, it would not apply in humanitarian circumstances and `it, of course, doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits'. Honestly, one has to really question the meaning of these words, which can be found in any dictionary, to understand why cynicism about this government continues to build in the community. Mr Howard reiterated this with his statement in question time in the House last Wednesday, 22 May. He said:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Can I just make it perfectly clear to the Leader of the Opposition . . . you introduced a six&amp;hyphen;month period. All we have done is to extend your six months to two years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us now talk about the deception. In a letter written this month by Mr Howard to his social security minister, Senator Newman—our famous Senator Newman; we must talk about her another time in another debate—Mr Howard approved a proposal by the minister to add a host of welfare benefits and payments to the two-year waiting list. Mr How
        <break page="1760" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         ard, the Prime Minister, also added his own suggestion that the higher rates of family payment to migrants also be included on the waiting list.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In another letter the Prime Minister directed Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, to bring proposals to cabinet for cutting access by new arrivals to labour market programs and Austudy, thus broadening the reach to non-social security measures. By no definition in anybody's language or understanding can these measures be referred to as social security benefits. This is yet another broken election commitment in a long line of them by this government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Need I remind the House of the government's commitment not to introduce new taxes or raise existing ones. The three per cent import tax as a result of changes to tariff concessions put paid to that. What about the promise of 7,500 job cuts in the Public Service over three years and no forced redundancies? Is it any wonder that people have stopped believing?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition's proposed higher education cuts are another example of a serious breach of faith, but let us talk about the adequacy of the safety net involved in the legislation we are looking at. One consequence of the coalition's reduced safety net for new migrants will be greater demand for emergency relief from voluntary organisations. These people, these organisations, are partially dependent on our Commonwealth funding, and they will require extra financial assistance to meet those new demands. Has the government even thought about this? Do they even care? Have they considered discussing this with the organisations  concerned? No, not at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn to the extension of the new waiting period to other classes of people. The government proposes to extend the range of new arrivals subject to the waiting period to include groups which have never been subject to the waiting period, such as spouses who have married a long-term Australian resident. They have never been included. How on earth can those opposite sit there and say that this is an honest approach to government when on the one hand they say that all they are doing
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         is extending an existing regime and, on the other hand, they weave this deceit?
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The extension of waiting periods to a new range of benefits and support payments is another area of deceit. The present six&amp;hyphen;month waiting period applies to the jobsearch allowance, the newstart allowance, the youth training allowance, the parenting allowance and the sickness allowance. The government's legislation imposes a waiting period on a range of benefits. They have been mentioned before, and I am going to mention them again. They include the mature age allowance and the widow allowance. For heaven's sake, in the case of a poor migrant family which arrives here looking forward to a life in our wonderful country and one of the spouses dies, we will have to say to them that we are really sorry but our government believes they have to be on the hardship line for two years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The carers pension is another terrific example. Let us talk for a moment about the carers pension. Under Labor, no waiting period was applied to the carers pension—none. This legislation means an Australian citizen in need of special care which can be provided by an overseas relative will have to have sufficient means to support both himself or herself and the carer for the first two years. Obviously, we do not care about the human element. Obviously, we do not care that a newly arrived migrant family in this country could have some terrible accident or illness befall them and this government will say to them, `I'm really sorry. You will get care and compassion from us after two years—not before.' I think it is just disgraceful.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government's legislation also imposes a waiting list on the disability wage supplement, the maternity allowance, for heaven's sake, and the child disability allowance. Again, these are areas of social policy—

       <para first-indent="16">
        A moment ago I was outlining to the House some of the disgraceful effects that are going to occur in areas of social policy, areas that have been hard fought for many years and social policies that this side of the House believes should apply to everybody. We do not have a divisive attitude to social policy—quite the reverse. But the people over on the
        <break page="1761" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         other side of this place tend to have a view that the best way to govern this country may be to divide it. I do not share that view. I am horrified at the thought that they believe they are here with that idea legitimately in their head.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Child disability allowance is another area of social policy where I do not believe anybody should be excluded, should they need it. Thankfully, none of the normal citizens already in this country have to wait two years to qualify for it. Why should new arrivals? Why should a newly arrived family which has an accident befall it, or an illness or disease come across a member of that family, have to do without for two years? It is disgraceful. The mobility allowance, family payment and special benefit have been talked about at length. I will not go on about them. We have to drive home to these people the absolute immorality of their stance on this issue.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other angle in relation to this legislation that I find quite fascinating is the philosophy underpinning it. The government has admitted that these measures will save $332 million. I believe that the barometer on the saving moves somewhat each day. The pre&amp;hyphen;election costings by the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, projected savings of $616 million or so over three years. At the moment, over three years we are looking at savings in the vicinity of $330 million, which leaves a shortfall in excess of $280 million. The coalition has a choice: either you have a hole in your costings or you continue to find ways of filling the hole.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I wring my hands in despair if you do the latter because in doing the latter what you will do is continue to cast your eyes over lists of benefits and lists of people and say, `We're here because we believe we need to control in some fashion a balance sheet. We don't believe we're here in any way whatsoever, in any shape or form, to have any compassionate view of the community. So what we'll do is we'll continue to look for ways to save money. We'll do that and we'll think we're pretty terrific at the end of it, and basically to billyo with the people who might be suffering as a result.'

         I repeat my opening words: as a new member in this place, with maybe the naive attitude that honesty is part of the representation in this House—and I stand on a very strong platform of personal honesty—I am appalled that the Prime Minister and his government come in here day after day and declare themselves the new, honest, open government of the country, when all they are doing is predicating every statement they make on the basis of open dishonesty and deceit. I find it an appalling con of the people of this country. Not only do I refer to the effect of this piece of legislation on our migrant population but also I remind members that there are members of our community who are either migrants or Australian born, so they are already citizens, who may not agree with this either. There are people out there who may be appalled to find that their next&amp;hyphen;door neighbour, a new arrival, cannot get a carer's pension, cannot get a family allowance, that they have been told in a deceitful manner that they can come here under another aspect. I find it appalling. I think the government should hang its head in shame.

         —This debate is very important to members on this side of the House—not simply because of its content, not simply because of the people involved in it, but because of what it symbolises in connection with those now in government. If we look back at the election campaign and at the areas and people targeted for cuts, we see a very divisive and very unpleasant aspect. Those now in government picked on three groups of people. One of those groups was migrants.

        But more than that, the projection of costs savings involved was not accidentally costed, as some people think. In fact, many on this
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         side held the view that somehow the government had made a mistake in its costings. There was no mistake; it was deliberate, as were other costings. The costings that were inflated were those which were more likely to bite. The costings that were exaggerated were those which were more likely to fit with anecdotal attitudes.

        The idea that people come to Australia to get on the dole—and that is what is being put across—and the fact that this measure will save $616 million have just reinforced all that stereotyping, all those subliminal messages. It was a very nasty strategy, it was a very divisive strategy—but it was not accidental. The costings were not a mistake; they were known to be false.

        The irony is that those in the community who agreed with that particular point of view, that this massive number of people come here deliberately to get the dole—and I have heard those opposite say how we are regarded as a bunch of mugs, how stupid we are and how the whole world regards us as being absolutely foolish for allowing this to happen—have not worked out yet that the vast bulk of those on unemployment benefits who are migrants will not be affected by this legislation because they are here on humanitarian and refugee grounds. The fact is that those who find it hardest to get work are those who have come from national disasters—those who have not been to school, those who have been raped or assaulted or had their families brutalised. They are the ones who find it hard to get work.

        And what has the government done? Those people are not part of this scheme. So the number of unemployed people from overseas will not be reduced, unless the government reduces the number of humanitarian and refugee classes—which they are also doing in a separate way.

I point out that part of that endorsement was an endorsement of the access and equity strategy of the then Labor government, and it is now endorsed by the current government. One of the points in that report, on page 25, refers to equality of opportunity for participation in personal development, community life and decision making.

He endorsed the report and, since there has not been a debate on that report, I would express my appreciation to the secretariat—Bjarne Nordin, Marie Kawaja, Lynette Sebo and Jodie Williams—for their excellent work. I recommend the report to all members. It is an interesting report because it does strongly reinforce the fact that this country has had a policy of access and equity, of fairness and a fair go.

        What we are seeing tonight is not a fair go at all. What we are seeing tonight is a creation of two classes of Australians: where a person at work on an income paying taxes will not be entitled to family allowances—will not be entitled to a whole range of services which are not social security but which are support for families—but where a colleague on the same salary, with the same job in the same location, living in the same street will be. For a government that is supposed to be so supportive of families, this legislation creates two kinds of families: those who came from overseas and those who did not. Even with the overseas ones there is more than one group.

         I have a case right now of a constituent who has been required to take out American citizenship because their father is now hospitalised as a result of a stroke. That person may have to apply to migrate back to Australia. If they do that, they will have to undergo the two-year qualifying period. I suppose the government would prefer that we put people into a nursing home instead. That will cost twice as much. Forget about the carer's pension, forget about this person coming home and caring for their father, because that is not what you want. The kind of discrimination being involved in this goes against all the rhetoric, all the philosophy and all the idealism that those opposite espoused for years—not just during the campaign but for years before.

         I think the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been caught by his words. I think the words used in the previous parliament—`mean' and `sneaky'—start to have a real meaning to them. It is mean and sneaky and weak. The strength in all of this is not with the Prime Minister but with others. Where is the toughness in the government coming from? Where is the gung-ho ideology? Who is behind all the cuts? I suggest that the word around the corridor in recent times is that it is not the Prime Minister—he is actually quite kind, because we keep hearing him making nice remarks and nice statements. The word coming around the tracks is that the real power behind all of this is not the Prime Minister; it is somebody else or more than one person. Certainly, one should look at the election costings of those opposite. I do at times feel a bit sorry for those government backbenchers who thought the costings were accurate as well. They are suddenly discovering that what they thought they campaigned on is not the case.

         —I am glad we have some latitude in discussions on these supply bills because I intend to talk about industry policy, the lack of which is going to make provision of supply in this country increasingly difficult. I do not watch much television, but in my motel room the other night I saw a debate chaired by that intellectual giant Kerry O'Brien. He was interviewing a lot of so&amp;hyphen;called leaders of industry. These are the people who, in a sense, have Australia's future in their hands. I was appalled at their apparent inability to grasp what needed to be done. While it did not stop the entire debate and there may have been some speakers there who did realise it, these people seemed to be pushing strongly for the development of the service sector.

But government has an absolute responsibility to create in the community the pre&amp;hyphen;conditions which will make industry thrive.

In 1990&amp;hyphen;91, Australia produced 368,000 vehicles, while Japan made 13&amp;half; million vehicles. This demonstrates what has happened here.

        In 1946, when the Chifley government was contemplating the establishment of the car industry in Australia, it was advised by Mr Hartnett, who, in my view, is one of the great Australians. Mr Hartnett was then the general manager of General Motors in Australia and his advice to the government was that if it was contemplating a car industry then it was essential that it had its own car—it should not build someone else's car. The government did not do that, however; it took the easy road and invited General Motors in. By doing this, of course, it could not fail, but neither could it ever succeed.

        I believe that, if we are going to have a viable industry, we as a nation must have the confidence and unity to act in hope of gain; which brings me to industrial relations, which is very much on the agenda at the moment. The truth about industrial relations is that while ever there is high unemployment, there will inevitably be a lot of downward pressure on conditions of employment. While unions may be able to make some barricade defences in some industries for some time, inevitably that pressure will be the consequence. I say that the only future for Australia is as a high wage, high productivity country. We must have high wages and high productivity to service them, and that means we must be involved in industries in the manufacturing sector, which requires a high degree of intelligence.

I am sure I will be excused for the plagiarism. We ought to look at the mining industry because mining is extremely important to Australia. It is by far our biggest export earner and has the potential to increase those earnings considerably. In the Western Australian economy in the year 1990&amp;hyphen;91, the value of mineral production, mostly exported, rose 15 per cent on the 1989&amp;hyphen;90 figures. It rose to $12.7 billion while employment in the sector fell marginally and there was a reduction in just about every commodity price. In fact, I cannot think of one commodity for which there was not a reduction in price in that year.

         Productivity increased a lot more than 15 per cent, but we had a reduced labour force and that is going to continue. The reason that we are the most efficient miners in the world is that we apply all the technology. We are frontrunners in this area and we are going to continue replacing jobs with technology. Yet mining is very important in many areas because it is the only industry that can operate there. In many outback areas, it is the only hope for the provision of employment for Aboriginal people. It is an absolute travesty that we see native title in Western Australia now holding up so many mining developments.

         This fact is being hidden. It was hidden by the last government and it has been hidden by this government. The present Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), as the last minister did, will say to you, `Nonsense! Gold production is in fact rising in that part of Australia.' This is the part of Australia which produces 75 per cent of Australia's gold and, yes, that statement is true; but production is rising because the exploration has so far been on brownfield sites, on extensions to existing mines where native title is not a consideration and not a problem. The problem is that those mines are all going to run out at about the same time. You will see in Australia, in about four years time, a whole swag of these mines going out of production at the same time. It takes four or five years to get a mine into production, and every week and every day of delay puts at risk this very important earner for Australian exports.

Yes, in the mining industry we have customers who are large by world standards. You need a state-of-the&amp;hyphen;art customer. Yes, certainly in hard rock mining we are the best in the world and we are very good at open pit mining. We have those two. The third thing is government will—not necessarily government funds but government will—and I think that is sadly lacking in Australia. We therefore do not manufacture the equipment for our mining industry.

If you reduce them to $1.2 billion it is still a basis for a substantial industry that could create a lot of employment.

The fact that some is provided by the World Bank is beside the point. If Australian equipment were the best they would buy it. We could have a very good industry here based on the needs of our own world-class mining industry. But you see very little evidence of this happening and one has to ask why.

          There are other areas we have to look at. Our wool industry is in crisis. It is in crisis because returns to the growers are simply not enough. It is hard to know what can be done about this. I would suggest that what we are doing is entirely counterproductive. I noticed that we voted in the parliament the other day to give Wool International Holdings $24 million to find new selling initiatives for wool. This was a nonsense because all the selling initiatives are there. Wool Holdings International will not come up with anything new at all.

          I believe there is hope for the Australian wool industry by going further down the processing chain. Throughout the world where commodity prices have had downward pressure on them, the people who have been successful have gone down the processing chain to recoup for the growers more of the value of their product. It would be nice to say that we could set up spinning mills to spin wool in Australia. However, I suspect that doing that, while it would potentially create jobs in country towns or in cities in Australia, would not necessarily return more money to the grower.

          In India, a country with enormous capacity in the wool area, and which has technology which is generally better than that in China, wages are 25c an hour. It is probably a good thing for us to exploit that situation so that our growers can retain ownership of their wool further down the process. My calculations show that probably $1.50 per kilo could be returned to growers. If a percentage were taken off for someone managing this, someone in the private sector, someone with potential such as Elders, it would probably be something in the line of $1.20. The $1.20 increase in the price of wool would be very acceptable, and that would do a lot to give stability to country areas.

It is saying to these people, `Spend time and effort racing around getting the necessary papers and talking to people'—often these are people who need some form of assistance in terms of language—`but don't go to a local office, don't go to where the people actually are.

At that stage, though, through community outrage and, I might say, the combined efforts of the local members, that decision was overturned. I would like to think that we are going to be able to do that again. The only trouble is that two of us who represent Wollongong properly do not come from the Prime Minister's party which is now the government.

It is no secret that, ever since I have been in this place, I have been a great champion of, and advocate for, the University of Wollongong.

For example, on recent calculations, the University of Wollongong is the third major employer in the Illawarra region. It is also a major contributor to the local economy. The Vice&amp;hyphen;Chancellor, Professor Gerard Sutton, has estimated that the impact on the Illawarra of lost revenue and expenditure will be something like $50 million per year if this 10 to 12 per cent cut to higher education funding that has been foreshadowed by Senator Vanstone takes effect in respect of the University of Wollongong.

I would have thought over the last few months following the tragedy that occurred in Port Arthur that concerns about the importation of illegal weapons—not to mention drugs and other illicit cargo—and illegal immigrants coming through ports like Port Kembla might be at the forefront of the minds of government members, but it seems not. In question time yesterday I directed a question to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) concerning Port Kembla, and the minister gave me an answer about Dampier, in Western Australia. I pointed out to him that staff at the Port Kembla customs office, which looks after not just Port Kembla but all the way down to the Victorian border, including the port of Eden, are going to be cut from 15 to 5—15 to 5!

         The intelligence work which the minister believes is the panacea to any concerns expressed about the Australian Customs Service is going to be conducted from Sydney with flying squads. We all know what risk assessment is about. The only trouble is that the flying squad is also going to be cut by 10. On top of that, in Port Kembla Customs Service officers have been told to work nine to five, five days a week. There is to be no weekend work, no shift work and no overtime. In question time yesterday I asked the minister whether he honestly believes that criminal activity occurs only between the hours of nine to five Monday to Friday and that nothing happens on a weekend. Obviously the government does believe that. What an absolute joke! The way in which the Australian Customs Service is being treated by this government is scandalous. This short&amp;hyphen;sighted decision will have a drastic effect on areas such as Port Kembla and Eden and on revenue collection, which goes with schemes like the diesel fuel rebate scheme and others.

         I now turn to DEETYA. I received a copy of a letter addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) from the New South Wales adult migrant education service in the Wollongong region. This letter points out what I think is absolutely scandalous and outrageous about this government. This government has refused to fund 17 classes that were planned to start on 13 May for English either for work or for literacy&amp;hyphen;numeracy skills. Some 278 students are waiting for those classes to start. Of those students, 211 are from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, and 51 are from the former Yugoslav republic and are mainly refugees. What a caring, compassionate government! This is the same government whose leader said before the election, `No&amp;hyphen;one will be worse off. We really do care for refugees and people from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds.' Yet it has cut the funding of these classes.

          At the end of June, an additional 57 students who are registered with the CES will complete the 510 hours of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs funded classes. They have an expectation that additional class work will be made available to them through DEETYA to provide them with a leg up so that they can compete equally in the Illawarra work force with people from English speaking backgrounds. But will that happen? No, it will not. This uncaring, insensitive government has frozen funds and refuses to fund these sorts of classes.

          It is not only the adult migrant English service in Wollongong that is being affected by DEETYA cuts; there are going to be skillshare closures—we have heard announcements about that today. The department in Wollongong has been told not to spend any more money on any further projects. In fact, it has been told to look at ways it can rationalise its service. In my colleague's electorate of Throsby, unemployment is still 15 to 18 per cent in pockets, and youth unemployment is probably about 20 per cent. In my own area where it is about 10 per cent and youth unemployment is about the same, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs is talking about closing CES offices.

          Why? Because it has said that it is going to give that to the private sector, that they are the best ones to find people jobs, and that the Commonwealth cannot do it. Not only will we see the closure of CES offices in areas such as Dapto, which is operating on a month to month lease at the present time, but some of the regional and area offices of DEETYA are going to be amalgamated because they believe that they can slash the numbers. We are going to see at least 50 staff in DEETYA given the old heave&amp;hyphen;ho in the Illawarra region, all under the guise of economic rationalism.

          We are trying to stimulate economic development in our region with some new, expansive and enhanced programs. I feel it is rather sad that the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) chose not to contribute towards funding a major form of infrastructure, which would have had enormous impact on tourism and, indeed, on sport. I know the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) is well aware of the Illawarra indoor entertainment sports centre. His government, when he was the Premier of New South Wales, generously promised $14 million towards that centre. Mr Carr, his successor, has honoured that commitment. We have asked for a $4 million contribution from regional development funds because of the tourism and employment generation impact it would have, particularly for young people. What was the minister's response? `Sorry, no way. That doesn't stack up against regional infrastructure program initiative guidelines.' Garbage, garbage.

There has been a long list of speakers and many of them have touched upon matters concerning their electorates. An example of that was the previous speaker. Many of them have expressed their views on the current state of the economy and a number of opposition members have levelled criticism at the government in the course of the debate over the past several days. I do not accept that criticism. It is a little difficult to understand how members of the opposition can criticise the management of the economy by this government in the very few months that we have had to look at the state of the accounts. It is necessary to address the state of the accounts and that has been the manner in which the government has brought this forward and the manner in which it will approach the budget to be delivered in August.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That act was passed last year with the support of both sides of the House. It had the effect then of implementing over 500 tariff classification changes, including changes pursuant to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System of the World Customs Organisation to which we are a signatory. That 1995 act gave effect to Australia's obligations to align our tariff structure with the international standard.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill which is before the House effects technical amendments to several pieces of legislation as well as to other instruments and they are consequential amendments on the passing of the 1995 act. For example, the bill updates references in Commonwealth legislation to the 1987 Customs Act so that it is changed to refer to the 1995 act. The bill preserves the operation of most of the by&amp;hyphen;laws and determinations and concession instruments made under the 1987 act and without such provisions those instruments would lapse on 1 July of this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also establishes a mechanism for continuing the operation of instruments made under the 1987 act where tariff headings have not been translated across from the 1987 to the 1995 act. The bill also contains transitional provisions for applications for concession instruments lodged before, but not dealt with, by 1 July 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For all of those things that the bill does we commend the government for enacting these machinery provisions because they clearly will ensure the effective operation of an act which we introduced in government last year. However, I do want to take the opportunity in this debate to indicate that what the opposition does not support is the manner in which the government intends to cut the budget of the body which administers this legislation and that is the Australian Customs Service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have been seeking in question time to ask the minister many times over the last few weeks about the staff and budget cuts to the Customs Service and the impact, in particular, that those cuts are going to have on the asserted claim to a crackdown that this government says it has the intention of making on illegal drugs, on prohibited firearms and on pornographic material. Sadly, we are still waiting for the answers despite many questions to the relevant minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know, for example, from an internal minute from the Australian Customs Service—a minute, I might say, that the government would not let us table in the parliament—as well as from other sources, the extent of those cuts. We know that there is to be $31 million cut from the overall budget of the Australian Customs Service and that this is going to result in some
        <break page="1781" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         400 jobs being lost, particularly in regional locations. Effectively, they will be gone from the department. That is a 36 per cent reduction in overall staff levels.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We know, for example, that the Tasmanian investigation unit is to be closed and we know that the effect will be to reduce the customs presence in important outposts of the Australian Customs Service. For example, at Port Kembla the staff is to be reduced from 12 to seven, shift work is to be abolished and there is to be no weekend customs surveillance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When we asked the question as to why those cuts are necessary, against the background of the government's commitment to crack down on the prohibited imports—the firearms, the pornographic material and the narcotics—we were initially told by the minister that the reason for these cuts was the so-called deficit that had been inherited by the incoming government in relation to the previous government's activities. Yet when one reads this minute one sees that the cuts have got nothing to do at all with anything that the government claims to have found on coming to office. They are all entirely due to promises made by the then opposition when it was seeking office to effect savings in their document, `Meeting the commitments', or whatever the precise title of it is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to refute the notion that the so&amp;hyphen;called $8 billion black hole is the reason for the cuts. The minute that I referred to before says that the meeting, convened to discuss the way in which the cuts would be effected, was undertaken against the background of the government's foreshadowed across&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;board two per cent efficiency dividend. This was additional to the pre&amp;hyphen;existing one per cent dividend already included in departmental forward estimates, further expected reductions in information technology and consultancy resources, and further running cost savings of $50 million over three years identified specifically for Customs. All those reasons and parameters within which the cuts are now being effected were commitments that the then opposition made in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the time, the government said that there should be cuts in running costs across all departments of two per cent and that it would hold up certain programs on the implementation of information technology procedures. This information was put in a document to the electorate before the government attained office to indicate the way in which it would pay, in part, for promises that it made. We know that what it was asserting to pay for was not able to be justified appropriately in any of the material it put forward. The government professes to be open and honest. We are still trying to get it to open the books so we can see the accounts; we still cannot get the material that Finance gave the government in regard to its other promises.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I underscore the point that the reason for these cuts has got nothing to do at all with the $8 billion so-called black hole; it has got everything to do with promises made by the then opposition in the lead-up to the election. The effect of these cuts is a significant closure of Customs offices. From advice that has come into our hands, we know that there is going to be a significant closure and/or reduction of district Customs offices. The customs offices proposed for closure are in Fyshwick—which is now to be done from Canberra—Griffith, Geelong, Mildura, Albury, Port Walcott, Whyalla, Wallaroo and Berri. To indicate the extent of the staff reduction in those places, in New South Wales alone the staffing level will come down by almost half and in Victoria there will be a staff reduction of 25 per cent. These are cuts which the government has made as a result of commitments that it entered into prior to the last election.
       </para>
       <break page="1782" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another point that is worth while making is that when the minister was seeking to justify the basis for the cuts, he said that the service would now be able to rely on more efficient targeting and it could rely more effectively on the introduction of information technology. Because of recent progress in information technology, the Customs Service would be able to cope with the cuts. But the reality is that, in the same election commitments, we have a government committed to substantially cutting the progress of the implementation of information technology. One of the big savings that the government announced prior to the last election was the holding back of progress in the implementation programs of information technology.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The departmental minute that I referred to talked about further expected reductions in information technology. We have exposed the fact that the $8 billion black hole is not the justification for these cuts. Information technology should be able to ensure a crackdown on crime, illicit firearms and drugs, but the departmental minute reveals that the Customs Service is under pressure to reduce the information technology program. Try as we might in question time in the Parliament, we have been unable to get the minister to come clean and tell us how the Customs Service is supposed to operate. He refuses to accept the obvious: that the cuts to the Customs Service will drastically reduce its capacity to perform functions, especially in relation to the illegal importation of drugs, firearms and pornographic material.

         It is interesting that when the current minister was the shadow minister responsible for Customs, he actually penned a letter to—if you like—the shadow Expenditure Review Committee. After the analysis of the effectiveness of the Customs Service was done, he had this to say:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         While there are infrequent complaints about Customs inspection and clearance procedures, overall they—

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         run a smooth and efficient operation. Any budgetary cuts to this area would slow down the clearance of goods, holding up businesses and result in a lesser frequency of inspections.
        </para>
        <para>
         And this is the important point. This is Mr Prosser in a letter to the shadow finance minister of the day, continuing:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . I do not believe that there is room for cuts within these areas. Any decline in the intelligence activities will impact on Customs' law enforcement activities and, in particular, their success.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is true that that was a letter written some five years ago in 1991, but when the then opposition had to look for savings in the context of putting together Fightback—and this was in the context of the Fightback exercise, a much harsher regime, one could argue, in which they were trying to find savings—this was the conclusion that the then shadow minister, now current minister, came to. He did not believe that there was any room for cuts. Those are his own words.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So we have got to ask the question: what has changed since then? Why should there be a retreat from that position? The then shadow minister had responsibility for going around the country looking at the way the Customs Service operated, and at the conditions under which it was expected to function. He had analysed the situation and had come to the conclusion that Customs was a smooth and efficient operation. He came to the conclusion that any budgetary cuts would slow down the clearance of goods, hold up businesses, and result in lesser frequency of inspections.

        <break page="1783" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Now he is going to put in place the very things that he argued against some years ago and which will slow up the business processes. For a government that claims to be committed to assisting small businesses and cutting the red tape, this is going to slow up their proceedings, and it will result in lesser frequency of inspections. It will do all the things that he argued most strongly against. He said that he did not believe that there was room for any cuts in these areas and yet, within two months of being sworn in as a minister, he is presiding over these same savage cuts to a department that he now administers.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Little wonder that the Australian public is now starting to see what we tried to expose during the election campaign: the duplicity of this government in office. They would say anything in opposition to try to ensure that different groups in the community who potentially could be threatened were satisfied and were put at ease. As soon as they get into office they scrap all of those commitments and move on to gutting the organisation and its effectiveness.

          We know from the information that we have already that this is starting to have a major impact. The other day in Mayfield in the Hunter area, a sports supply business received two packages of hand guns from Europe containing a total of 26 revolvers and automatics. They passed through Customs and police without any examination because when the boxes arrived they still had lead seals placed on them by the manufacturer. The seals were still intact and there had been no police permits issued. The two boxes of firearms were delivered to the sports supplier on 22 May and the guns are believed to have been picked up by Customs at a later date. In circumstances involving an authorised gun dealer there is the capacity to track these things down at a subsequent stage. But we have been talking about the issues of gun control and the ease of access to illegal weapons. Here we have a situation on 22 May where a package of this sort of material can get through Customs and end up at the supplier before it is tracked down. I think this highlights the fact that, with the reduction of services and the cutting back of facilities with the ability to scrutinise, this sort of activity could clearly occur all around the country.
         </para>

          As the minister is here, another point I would highlight is that we have tried to get from him the logic for these cuts. We have asked many questions of him in the parliament and we still have not got a satisfactory explanation. I hope the opportunity presents itself for him to actually explain the logic to us. There is no point pretending that you are serious about the crackdown on illicit imports when you are not prepared to provide the facilities by which that can be undertaken; when you run counter to all of your own advice in opposition about what should be cut out of the service and what should not be; when you advise by way of internal information to the department that there is no room for cuts in these areas and then you proceed in office to implement those very cuts.

          I will give an indication of how the minister stumbles on these things. Yesterday he was asked a question about how in the light of all of the cuts to the regional areas that I talked about before and the areas of Mildura, Albury, Port Walcott, Fyshwick, Whyalla, Wallaroo, Berri, Geelong and Griffith—the cuts and closures to those offices—he proceeded to give an
          <break page="1784" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          That highlights the sort of non&amp;hyphen;answer that we continue to get from this minister. He knows that what he has got himself into here is a commitment to introduce cuts that he does not believe in. He is on the record himself saying that he does not believe there is any room for cuts in these areas. That is what you said when you were asked in opposition, as a shadow minister, to assess the opportunity for cuts in this area and report where the savings could be made. Your response at the time then was, `I don't believe there is room for any cuts.' In fact, you went further and said, `Any decline in the intelligence activities will impact on customs law enforcement activities and in particular their success.' We agree wholeheartedly, and that is why we have been trying to get you to come clean and explain what has now changed.

          What is it that now can still result in 440 cuts which you said previously could not be justified, and which will not impact on enforcement activities? We know these cuts will impact on enforcement activities. There is no point trying to hide behind the $8 billion black hole—these cuts are everything to do with your election promises. There is no point trying to pretend that this is just a crackdown on Canberra bureaucrats, because these are cuts that are going to affect the regional offices. Don't you think that the people who are the crooks, the people who are going to try to ensure they don't get detected, are going to jump with joy when they know we are closing the regional offices—the points which they know they can come into because you are closing them down?

At every point where I have referred to `you', I was referring to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), because he is the culprit. The minister has changed his tune. The minister when in opposition didn't believe that cuts were justified and now he has been directed to implement them and he does not know how to defend those cuts. He has been given a line by Peter Costello that says to just blame the $8 billion black hole, but his own Customs Service completely rejects that as the basis upon which the cuts are being effected. It says that the cuts are due entirely to the coalition's election promises of the two per cent cuts, the hold&amp;hyphen;back in information technology and the need to reduce running costs in this department. The minister still has a lot of answering to do but, as we have found out, he doesn't know how to answer the questions in the parliament. I hope this debate gives him some opportunity to do so when he gets up on his feet.

          From our point of view, we are not opposing the bill itself but we are expressing very serious concern about what is happening to the very fine Customs Service which we have established in this country and which has served this country well. We share, on both sides of the House, the need to ensure that at our borders we can hold back the illicit imports; that we can stop the illegal firearms; that we can stop the narcotics coming in that affect many in the population, particularly the young people; and that we can stop the pornographic material and the way in which that is able to be used in the community. We agree on those things, but you cannot do it unless you have an effective customs service and you cannot have an effective customs service if you cut 440 places from it.

           The reality is this: because the government knows that the cuts cannot be at the point that is going to impact upon people it cannot implement many of these cuts so far as passengers are concerned. The last thing it would want is queues of people at airports, slowed up in their clearance into this country, because passenger movement operations had been cut back.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The instruction, as we understand it, is not to target the cuts to passenger activities—which the minister tried to argue were not being cut when he answered some questions in parliament a couple of weeks ago—but, indeed, to target them at the behind&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;scenes areas, such as investigation and cargo examination.
          </para>

           The investigation units are to be closed down in a number of different ports. We accept the notion that every piece of cargo coming in cannot be inspected. But the investigation units are there to develop the intelligence, to identify what should be the focus of investigation and to try to catch the activity that way. If the investigations unit is abolished, what is the means to target? As I indicated before, that example in terms of Newcastle is an important case in point.

           What we are seeing here is a minister who cannot defend his department. He is not prepared to go out and back the Customs Service that he has responsibility for administering. The minister is telling the service that there is a responsibility on its part to give effect to government decisions to crack down on illegal imports. Yet he is gutting its very capacity to do so. He is not prepared to defend the basis upon which the service can function correctly because the minister has been given an instruction to make cuts at any cost, to look at the bottom line and not at the impact it is going to have on the service's activity.

           We reject that approach. Sensible government has to be about identifying what the priorities of government are. Where there is the bipartisan support that is needed to crack down on the illegal importation of drugs, firearms and pornographic material, the body that is responsible for that crackdown must be resourced with the necessary wherewithal. If you are going to cut savagely into its ability to do it, its ability to influence the outcome is going to be seriously diminished.

           The minister's excuses in the House do not stand up. He cannot use the Costello line—the Costello con, if you like—of the $8 billion black hole. He has now been caught out trying to justify the cuts on that basis. The minister must come clean and explain how he expects the customs department to function with 440 fewer people. The minister cannot rely on the fact that improved information technology is going to help in that regard because his own government is hell bent on holding up the progress of information technology changes. It has put a stopper on information technology progress. That is going to impact on many departments, but one which it is definitely going to impact upon is the Customs Service.

           We support the legislation, but we oppose most vehemently the cuts that the minister is now imposing on his department. It is a bottom line cut. It is an accounting procedure. It has no regard to ensuring that the service can function correctly. It affects not just the service here in Canberra, but also in the regions. Honourable members opposite should be interested in this because, when one looks at what is going to happen to regional employment and the ability for the illicits to come across the regional borders, come through their areas, one realises that that is going to cause not just a loss of job opportunities, but huge dislocation and have a huge social impact on those communities. They ought to be concerned about what the minister is doing and get on to him about ensuring that the job cuts do not occur.

        It seems to me that we have to not only address the way in which modern technology allows greater supervision, but also recognise that those who seek to import goods into Australia as contraband, against our customs regulations, are also moving into a more sophisticated era. We cannot expect to be able to exercise adequate supervision unless we are able to at least match in technology those processes that people pursue.

        The shadow minister was talking about narcotics a while ago. The field of narcotics is a major trade. It is a trade where, inevitably, there are some who escape the supervision of Customs. But, at the same time, we can be proud that so many are in fact being caught.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also important to register, as far as narcotic smuggling is concerned, how great international cooperation has been. There is now a great deal of coordination and effort amongst the governments of all the countries in our region. For example, there have been, and remain, customs officers and officers of the Australian Federal Police working in Thailand in conjunction with their American counterparts. That trade is directed at ferrying narcotics not only to the United States but also to Australia, and through Australia, for consumption. They are trying to ensure that they coordinate their efforts internationally.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think we are very fortunate that there has been such a development in technology in the application of customs checks within Australia and in the coordination of efforts between the countries in our region. I believe customs surveillance is of a much higher order than it was a few years ago.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That has a particular relevance, of course, in terms of how Customs itself should exercise its function. In the reviews that are now under way we have to identify the best means to ensure that the task can be undertaken. I know that in the days gone by, for example, if you went into the United States you would spend an hour or two standing, after your aircraft had landed, before you were allowed to go through any of the entry procedures. Their approach was that the longer you stayed under camera surveillance, the more they were likely to find out who the people were who were carrying goods. I know that, in some ports of entry into the United States, that practice continues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The United States has always used that idea of leaving people standing around, shuffling and wondering when the devil they were going to be able to get through and get on with whatever their particular activity might be, as a means of surveillance. In Australia we have not used that technique. Yet I believe we have had at least as good a record in surveillance—and, in many instances, a lot better record—than that of our United States counterparts. But in international coordination, there is little doubt that in the work we have undertaken with the officers of the United States narcotics agencies and in other fields of Customs activity, a great deal has been achieved to help those in our region—particularly in the Golden Triangle, as far as narcotics are concerned—to ensure that we do have better inside information as to

        This legislation is specifically designed to pick up the new commodity description and coding system of the World Customs Organisation. While many of us are generally aware that the World Trade Organisation and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had consequences, this is one of the practical consequences of those negotiations. They are negotiations which do not put a bottom line under world trade. But they do allow significant progress and freedom of movement of goods compared to that which was negotiated in the Kennedy Round and earlier rounds that, over the years, have been the main fields of initiative and emphasis by successive governments in Australia and successive ministers for trade in the various hats they have worn.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, I can remember participating in some, long since, as minister assisting John McEwen when he was Minister for Trade and Industry. In terms of the degree to which there is now coordination and cooperation around the world, where customs and tariff barriers have been eased there is also a far greater cooperation. But essential to achieving that is common terminology. And that is essentially the product of these changes in the Customs Tariff (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1996 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are also a number of consequential amendments designed to ensure that, with the termination of the l987 act which will take place when this bill is written into law, there will still be a capacity within the legislation to enable a continuity of the provisions of that 1987 act, to the degree that they still have present relevance. For example, in the minister's second reading speech there is reference to some 22,000 tariff concession orders and commercial tariff concession orders, and processes that relate to their continued interpretation, which must be continued. Similarly, there is reference to some 800 tariff concession order applications and determinations in relation to the passenger motor vehicle plan and to by&amp;hyphen;laws.

        Having identified the nature of these changes, and talked a little about what I see as the efficacy of Customs work and my concern—which I think all of us share—that, resulting from budget analysis, there is not a reduction of the capacity of the Customs organisation, I would like to talk about three other fields. The first is my worry about quarantine. Quarantine is not strictly within the embrace of the administration of Customs in Australia; it is more within the ambit of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. But it has always been very closely associated with the point of entry inspection that is part of migration and part of Customs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One thing we need to understand is that, not only in the checking processes but in the procedures and the inspections that follow, it is absolutely essential that we recognise the enormous advantage Australia has had by being an island continent, shut off from some of the diseases and infectious complaints that affect particularly the livestock industries in other countries. Mad cow disease and its impact in the United Kingdom is but one example. It is so easy to feed to livestock animal offal or offal from, for example, fish and chip shops and other consumptive&amp;hyphen;type processes and not to understand the impact they have. Yet, essentially, that was the source of mad cow disease in Europe, and it is having a disastrous effect on the United Kingdom beef industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We need to understand that, in the future, some of our principal competitors in the livestock industries are going to be the South American countries. The reason is that they have applied very strict control processes. Just as BTEC—our brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign—has helped in ensuring access to European markets for our livestock, in South
        <break page="1789" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         America they are cleaning up the disease problems they have had. The point is that we cannot afford to allow the introduction into Australia—whether it is into our livestock, our tree species or our native flora—of the types of diseases that are prevalent abroad.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of biological control species that have been introduced from abroad which have had a tremendous impact. We need to be cautious about what we introduce, what the effect will be and what repercussions they are going to have that might not necessarily be recognised. So, within the nature of our customs organisation, I think there is a parallel responsibility with that of all other associated agencies to guard Australia's borders.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second thing that I wanted to comment on was the fact that we have all been conscious of the number of refugees that have come down, by boat in particular, from Asia in recent times. The effect on customs and the surveillance of our borders is different from what it used to be. Now far more frequently we have people who come to Australia by sea without giving any indication of their departure or even any indication that they are coming to Australia. The coordination, which I mentioned a while ago, between customs agencies and migration agencies ensures quite often that we have a general idea of the way in which those people are heading. But I think it is important that we find ways to establish the same coordination for stopping those people who come to Australia as purported refugees as we have for stopping, for example, narcotics and other forbidden substances and products coming into this country.
       </para>

        I think it is particularly important, as far as our neighbours are concerned—and I think of Indonesia in particular—that, if boats call into Indonesia on their way to Australia or on their way to Christmas Island or whatever is their final destination, we try to stop them there. It is important that we try to find ways by which unwanted movement can be regulated, as those people, when they arrive in Australia, inevitably are going to be returned to their country because so many of them are no longer under `reasonable fear of persecution'—which are the words used to establish the category of a refugee within our legislation and, indeed, within the definition of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

        It is important that we retain our willingness to accept those who are genuine refugees, but people who seek to be economic refugees should know of the procedures that are available for people coming to Australia as migrants. Part of the objective of Australia's migration program has been to welcome people to Australia, irrespective of class, race or background, if they seek to make a different way of life. Economic refugees do have a vehicle by which they can come to Australia, but it is not by getting into a boat and travelling in extraordinarily perilous conditions, and doing it in such a way that it not only affects our right to maintain the sanctity of our borders but also runs the risk of bringing in products and other substances that are unwanted and which really do threaten what we see as the sanctity of our own environment.

        The third thing I want to briefly touch on relates to an area that has often concerned me, especially with the many islands and waterways around Australia. It concerns the degree to which light aircraft and small boats can breach the customs barrier. I have been conscious, because of my wife's origin in Lord Howe Island, of the fact that when aircraft move between Norfolk and Lord Howe a customs officer has been there. In recent times, aircraft services have reduced and, therefore, the availability of customs procedures is lessened.

        This legislation does not specifically relate to any of those three latter issues but it is a piece of legislation designed to facilitate the legitimate movement of goods across international boundaries. It is an objective of the new status of the World Trade Organisation that all of us endorse. It is a movement which will help make the world a common market and help it move from the inefficiencies of the past with subsidised products to that of freer access, which these new regulations will permit. I commend the legislation, and wish the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs well in what I am sure is going to be a very interesting and effective term and one that he will enjoy.

          I want to respond to some of the points that the shadow minister made. He made a comment about a `very fine customs service' and it is one that I would agree with. The inference the shadow minister made with regard to the service was that any proposed reduction in efficiency or any efficiency dividends gained under the present government would have some impact on what he described as a `very fine customs service'.

        I would like to remind the shadow minister that, for the four years from 1991&amp;hyphen;92 to 1994&amp;hyphen;95, the Australian Customs Service suffered a reduction of 1,000 personnel under the term of the previous government and that it was during the period that he described it as a `very fine customs service'. I think is should be borne in mind, as my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has pointed out, that the Customs Service has changed substantially over the years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The shadow minister also made reference to the investigations unit. The investigations unit now is mainly concentrated on Melbourne and Sydney and that comes principally out of the Conroy report, again another report brought down under the previous government. I endorse the comments in that report about centralising the investigations unit. However, the shadow minister seemed to confuse the nature of border and barrier control with the role of the investigations unit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I might add, as my colleague the right honourable member for New England has mentioned, the Customs Service has changed very substantially over the last decade, particularly, the Coastwatch operations of the Customs Service. Coastwatch, comes under, I guess, the administration of Customs. It is now a contracted service and it is a very professional service. Indeed, because of a longer contractual term, the Coastwatch arm has now been able to acquire, in the main, a completely modern, brand&amp;hyphen;new fleet of surveillance aircraft. There are 13 fixed&amp;hyphen;wing aircraft in the fleet and one helicopter service operating out of Cairns and the Torres Strait. Again, as my colleague for New England mentioned, customs officers in the north&amp;hyphen;west of Western Australia particularly are apprehending everyone from boat people to illegal fishermen. It is the agency for quarantine inspection, immigration and a whole range of other services. The nature of customs has changed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the borders area, Customs processes just on 13 million passengers—six million of them coming in—and a number of cross&amp;hyphen;border transactions as well. To be able to process those

         people within a reasonable and acceptable time frame, we operate on a risk management basis. That is the same process that Customs operates in relation to the inspection of goods.

        The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) made reference to a crate of guns coming in. Indeed, it is the coalition government that very much tightened up the importation of guns. I am pleased to see that we have bipartisan support in that area and I am disappointed that the shadow minister is trying to say that it has not been the case that there has been a substantial tightening up in that area.

        To go back to the question of the investigations unit, it is not the barrier control. The investigations unit does not go and rip open crates, as in the old days. Their role is very specifically different: to investigate when there is fraud, across a whole range of areas, and other matters that need to be investigated and followed up on the advice, normally, of the barrier people.

         —Essentially, the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1996 reaffirms Australia's commitment as a contributor to the International Telecommunications Union and provides for the Commonwealth to pass the cost of ITU participation on to carriers. It basically confirms legislation which had been introduced under the former government but which did not proceed because of the dissolution of the last parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When one discusses Australia's ITU obligations, one is reminded that the telephone has become the prime, if not sole, means of communication for many people in Australia. For many people residing in rural and regional areas, their only contact with communities outside their own is on the phone. For elderly people and those confined to their homes it is a lifeline. The irony in this legislation is that it highlights the conflict between the functions of the ITU, which are noble and should be pursued by Australia in every forum, and the government's policy to sell Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Australia is bound to the ITU under the International Telecommunications Convention. But how ridiculous will it look when we cannot even fulfil our obligations under the convention to Australians themselves. The convention states that each country has the right to regulate its own telecommunications. But, by the same token, its function includes the promotion of telecommunications as a means to secure safety and social development.

       <break page="1792" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the primary functions of the ITU is to promote telecommunications development in new or developing countries and to provide technical support to assist in that task. Furthermore, it also has functions to promote the use of telecommunications in the pursuit of peace, the safety of human life, and the social and economic development of all countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill may be meeting our obligations overseas to developing nations, but it stands in stark contrast to what this government proposes to do with Telstra. How will selling Telstra contribute to the promotion of the safety of human life, and the social and economic development of Australia? In fact, it will do the opposite.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill is now subject to a provision, as it was under the previous government, that universal service obligations are to be provided as economically and efficiently as practicable. The massive change proposed by the new government is that the definition of economic and efficiency feasibility will no longer be made just by the government of Australia, acting in the public interest; it will be subject to the definition and understanding of those considerations by private enterprise, by foreign&amp;hyphen;owned economic interest. It is clear that they would take a jaundiced view of those universal service obligations.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is incredible that the National Party, mouthing platitudes about how it is the voice for rural people, would not acknowledge this fact. The universal service obligations provide that, for each telephone line in Maranoa, for example, some $3,300 is provided in subsidy. It is extraordinary that when we talk about elderly people in a community like Charleville, in the electorate of the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), those lines would be $3,300 a year more expensive than they are at the moment in a totally competitive environment. How is this contributing towards promoting the social and economic development of Australia?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All it is promoting are the profits that will be relocated for maintaining an affordable link with outside communities around rural Australia. All it is contributing, in terms of economics, is that residents in the bush will be paying their telephone bills to a partially foreign&amp;hyphen;owned company. National Party members, supposedly acting as the voice for rural Australia, have been exposed as nothing more than sell outs when it comes to Telstra. They are sell outs to their constituency, to the people whose interests they are supposed to represent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note, since the election of this government, the massive swings against the National Party in the New South Wales divisions of Clarence and Orange. It is interesting to note how around the bush, and among the opinion leaders in rural Australia, the National Party has become known as the patsy for the Liberal Party. In the bush, the National Party is willing to sell out interests as diverse as Telstra and the introduction of the ISDN link, questions of subsidies for diesel fuel in rural Australia and the importation of chicken meat. Across the board, they have become known as the patsies to the Liberal Party. It is repeated in this legislation.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Under current telecommunications laws, the minister responsible can direct cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies towards rural and regional areas. That authority is now threatened in practical terms by the proposed privatisation of Telstra.

        <para first-indent="16">
         In the Deputy Prime Minister's own seat of Farrer, some of the towns receive a universal service obligation of some $1,500. In the Deputy Leader of the National Party's seat of Gwydir, Narrabri received some $1,530. Nyngan, in the electorate of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), receives well over $4,000. In the electorate of O'Connor, some of the towns receive over $5,000. In the division of Wakefield, the subsidies are over $4,000 and the subsidies in Grey are substantial.

        <break page="1793" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Under a privatised Telstra, the minister cannot just tell the company where to direct its cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies because company law dictates that minority shareholders would have been oppressed. Unless the government is intending to alter the Companies Code, this will mean that all those subsidies will be lost. Even if a universal service obligation still exists, the government cannot instruct the company how it should be allocated. The government would be acting contrary to the provisions of the convention contained in this legislation. A perfectly competitive market with a privatised Telstra would dictate that areas of high demand return the greatest profits. It is not profitable to subsidise Narrabri, Nyngan or Charleville. It is more competitive to subsidise Vaucluse, Kooyong or Dalkeith on the cost of local calls, so subsidies will be reduced throughout rural Australia.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is regrettable that the government is pursuing a backdoor way to sell Telstra. It is regrettable, under the terms of the convention contained in this legislation, that there will be backdoor ways by which the universal service obligation is reduced. Those who will benefit will be the well off. How expensive will it be for elderly people or those who are housebound in rural areas to maintain contact outside their home? How does that promote safety, Minister, under the terms of our commitment to the ITU? How will this contribute to the safety of human life and the social development of rural communities, as advocated by the International Telecommunications Convention?
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We have the hypocritical situation of the government attempting to sell Telstra through the back door, despite the fact that it will cost a billion dollars in stamp duty as a result of adopting that method—the same amount of money as the government wants to spend on the environment. If the government were serious about conserving our natural heritage, this proposition would not even be examined. All it does is expose the fact that the government is driven by purely ideological desires to flog Telstra, with no benefit for the environment and no benefit for rural Australia. It now wants to throw away all the money that could have been spent on the environment just so that it can bypass the democratic processes of this parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A fact overlooked by the government, again in proving its complete hypocrisy on this issue, is that Telstra is so profitable, it having returned nearly $2 billion profit for the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 financial year. Its profits alone could fund two or three coalition environment packages until the next election. Three times over, the government could save the environment if it were really serious about it. The profits raised from Telstra in one year could fund the package and keep Telstra in public ownership.

          Yesterday the government was happy to cite examples of other countries that have turned to privatisation of their communications markets, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. But all Australians—except those on the government benches—living in the bush and in regional centres would acknowledge that you just cannot apply arguments used in those nations to a large, diverse, geographically broad nation like ours. Countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are tiny nations without Australia's demographics and our vast distances between rural and city centres where people rely on the telephone in unique ways as a form of communication.

         <para first-indent="16">
          Even if Telstra is only partially subsidised, there is no way in which it will be able to support the cross&amp;hyphen;subsidies, and the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on this issue will be shown to be hollow. What will French bankers care about people living in the bush? As if company directors in New York care about an elderly couple living in Nyngan not being

           able to afford a telephone line but relying on that telephone line, cross&amp;hyphen;subsidised around the nation, as their lifeline, their safety line, their basic form of communication for a whole range of emergency reasons and, of course, the very important social reasons for our senior citizens.

          Let me conclude by noting that since the 1989 ITU conference in Nice the need for a more active role by the private sector has been recognised but only in tandem—and this is what the government and the minister should acknowledge—with the need to raise the level of awareness of its importance in financial planning. It is clear from the government's blind obsession with the privatisation of Telstra, to the detriment of rural and remote areas, that under this Howard&amp;hyphen;Fischer administration there is no intention of fulfilling the sentiment of the ITU when it comes to objectives in Australia. Its social development goals are being thrown out the window with the government's foolhardy pursuit of the privatisation of Telstra.

        There are some things that the member for Werriwa has said which I need to address. In 1989 the Hawke Labor government brought in extra competition in a very profound way to the telecommunications industry of Australia. The effect of this was the loss of thousands of jobs, particularly throughout rural Australia. At that time we did not oppose the added competition because we also thought it was the way to go. In other words, there has been a profound change in the direction of the telecommunications industry in Australia and that of Western democracies over the last decade. If the Labor Party intends to go to the people at the next election with this tired old story about the extra cost facing people in the bush, it should think again.

        What we should not forget is that USO provisions are protected under the partial privatisation of Telstra in any case. Not only do we protect the country areas by including a capped pricing system; we offer a much improved service with the opportunity to take on mobile phones. One of the great issues facing many rural communities is the provision of mobile phones. Under the legislation approved by the previous government, many areas of rural Australia are totally excluded from having mobile phones. It is that legislation which provides this restriction. A mobile phone could have been very valuable to the mining town of Coober Pedy, for instance, where there is always the chance that a mining accident could occur. That has come too late because of the restriction placed on the accessing of that facility. The previous government's policies focused on metropolitan Australia and the competition between the digital and analog networks. That shows just how badly rural people were let down by the previous government.

I will not waste the time of the Main Committee talking about the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas because we all know the story behind those issues.

        To conclude my response to the comments made by the member for Werriwa, my understanding is that Australia remains almost the only Western democracy which retains full public ownership of its telecommunications carrier. There is perhaps one other such democracy in Europe. So we have this new era of communications throughout the world, and Australia is dragging the chain. Telstra has done a good job in the past. But if you look at its record of overseas investment and the efforts it has made in that area—that is, if you can get to the bottom of the figures—you will see that they are very unsatisfactory.

         —in reply—Mr Deputy Speaker, I will be very brief. I introduced this telecommunications bill into the House a little while ago. It is a very short piece of legislation which will assist the government to give effect to our obligations under the International Telecommunications Union arrangements. We stated, prior to the election, that we want to adopt a user&amp;hyphen;pays approach to the funding of the government's contribution to the union. In my second reading speech I outlined some of the reasons for that and the costs involved.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I think that this bill does enjoy the support of both sides of the chamber, although it was hard to detect that from the contribution made earlier by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). He talked about issues unrelated to this piece of legislation, in a re&amp;hyphen;run of his arguments in favour of the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill, which I introduced into the House some time ago. So it is not really appropriate that I respond to those remarks of his. In any event, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) adequately canvassed those issues. But there is one fundamental point that I think needs to be made in this debate. That is that the universal service obligations are enshrined in the government's legislation. As I pointed out to the member for Werriwa at the time of the debate in the main chamber on the bill to which he then referred, the words in the bill that went through are the exact same words as were in the bill of 1991. He still persists in trying to draw his long bow about the removal or the dilution of the universal service obligations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other point that he made, and it was also made by the member for Grey, was that the ITU is committed to the social and economic development of nations in the delivery of its telecommunications services. Most certainly, we subscribe to that view. As the member for Grey pointed out, Australia is one of only two countries left in the OECD that are not moving
        <break page="1796" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         to some liberalisation of ownership structures of their telecommunications delivery networks, giving effect to the movement in technology and the increasing market competition available in these particular industries. We will be left behind in the delivery of these services in our region and in the world if we persist in adopting the attitudes espoused by the member for Werriwa.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The one thing I would make comment about is mobile telephony. I agree absolutely with the member for Grey about the need for an expansion of mobile telephony into the broader community. There is a great need for that, and I am sure that the member for Werriwa would subscribe to that view. That is best achieved by allowing Telstra to have the flexibility, in competition with the other carriers, to deliver those services.

         —I thank the Main Committee for the opportunity to conclude my remarks about this bill. On the previous occasion when we were discussing this bill, I think it had been well canvassed that the purpose of the bill was to bring the Australian legislation into line with the requirements of the Basel convention. One of the important aspects of this amending bill is to enable the definition of hazardous waste to include that waste that might be recovered by the receiving country only on the basis that in that receiving country it would be dealt with in an environmentally sensitive manner. I also indicated my disquiet at what is believed to be the intention of the government to wind back the Commonwealth EPA.

        In the public debate about this legislation, whilst it has been minimal, there was an interesting exchange of ideas in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        earlier this month. Alan Oxley, Australia's former ambassador to the GATT, made comments about this legislation indicating that it was not in Australia's best interests; that it in some way permitted a unilateralism in Australian law on extraterritoriality; and that it harmed Australia's trade interests. I believe that the fact that there is unanimous agreement in this debate in support of the legislation debunks the position that has been put by Oxley.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A week after the Oxley article appeared in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        , there was a reply by way of a letter to the editor by Peter Christoff, a member of the Commonwealth Hazardous Wastes Policy Advisory Committee, where he went into some detail about the matters that Oxley raised. Where Oxley had suggested that the treaty was almost unimplementable because its basic terms cannot be agreed, Christoff indicated that in fact that was not the case because
        <break page="1797" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the convention went into some detail about defining the list of material and the criteria by which that material would be examined and determined as being hazardous waste.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I wish to quote the important final paragraph of Christoff's letter because I think it is important in the context of what may or may not be considered for the EPA. Christoff said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Finally, Oxley's opportunistic shot at the federal EPA, at a time when the EPA is under threat of significant cuts or abolition, is predictable given his radical deregulatory agenda. Those with longer memories will remember that the EPA was created largely at the behest of industry, seeking coherent and reliable national environmental benchmarks, standards and processes in the wake of the Wesley Vale fiasco.
       </para>
       <para>
        I indicate that that is a theme that I agree with and it is a theme that I will return to, because it is in the protection of the national benchmarks and having a national policy that I believe the Commonwealth EPA can play a great role. I think that, just as this Australian parliament has a role to play in debating and looking at matters that had to do with the health of Australia's economy, likewise this parliament and the government should be playing a role in ensuring the health of Australia's environment.

        In this debate, the issues of hazardous waste are being discussed in the broad international and national context. It must also be remembered that hazardous waste is something which impacts very heavily on the lives of individuals, in their neighbourhoods, in their communities. In researching for this debate, I pulled out some comments that were made back in April 1982 about a report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. I went to some remarks that my predecessor as the member for Scullin made at that time where he indicated, as a very keen local member, that there was a lake in his electorate which had been polluted by polychlorinated biphenyls—PCBs—that had been stored at a nearby junkyard with inadequate precaution and regulation. The PCBs then found their way into this recreational lake, which was used for sailing and had picnic areas around, and the PCB levels were unacceptably high.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem that that illustrated to the then Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation was the lack of proper regulation about the storage, disposal and transport of hazardous wastes in the domestic Australian scene. Fortunately, since then there has been much work done on bringing the state and territory guidelines and regulations about the movement of hazardous waste into line.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During this debate there has been some comment about the handling of radioactive waste. Whilst radioactive waste does not fall into the operation of the Basel convention, I wish to highlight yet another example in the northern suburbs of Melbourne which demonstrates clearly the possibility of dramatic effects on the quality of life of individuals if we do not dispose of hazardous waste appropriately.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Serious claims have been made regarding the disposal of army hazardous waste over 30 years ago in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. A former army mechanic has claimed that contaminated vehicle parts from the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in South Australia—as well as asbestos and acid drums—were deposited at an army dump at the Magyar barracks in Broadmeadows. This person has said that he was required to strip down vehicles brought in from the test site in South Australia and then wash them in acid. They were then buried as landfill. It is now proposed to build a 117-hectare industrial, commercial and residential development on the former army dump site. The residents of the northern suburbs of Melbourne have the right to feel confident and safe that the area they choose to live in is free of such contamination. This applies especially to those who will be buying properties on this
        <break page="1798" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         site. They have the right to know that such claims will be investigated properly at the highest level. For that reason I call upon the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) to have the claims of hazardous waste—possibly radioactive landfill—at Broadmeadows investigated thoroughly. These serious allegations obviously need to be dealt with before any idea of such a development at this site can be earnestly entertained.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Residents of Melbourne remember well the problems in the western suburbs at Ardeer during the 1980s. It was discovered that houses had been built where battery acid had been disposed of many years earlier. A situation like this must not be allowed to develop in Broadmeadows.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In conclusion, this is a very important piece of legislation. It is very important for the way in which Australia as a developed country sees itself joining in trade with developing countries. Many of the treaties that we enter into have that as their base. In this case, it is to show that we do not condone shifting what might be perceived to be a domestic Australian problem onto another country. We have entered into this agreement so that we ensure that our disposal of hazardous waste is both appropriate and does not shift the problem onto others. I believe—and it is interesting given former Ambassador Oxley's comments as the representative of Australia to GATT—that there are many other areas where, under GATT agreements, we might look at not only environmental policies but social policies. We should ensure, in trade between nations, that environmental aspects and social aspects such as child labour are taken into consideration. I thank the Main Committee for allowing me to conclude my remarks and I indicate my support for this amending legislation.

         —This legislation was introduced by the previous government. It essentially stems from the 1989 adoption of the Basel convention and Australia's ratification of it in 1992. The main thrust is to cover areas that were not originally envisaged and areas where there has now been an area of divergence between the convention and Australian legislation. That is mainly in the expansion of recycling in the developing world.

        This happened in the Western world, in our own front yard, and this is apparently an indicator to the reason why there had to be some legislative action. On 21 February 1995,

         Greenpeace raised the question of Pasminco and its export of a toxic chemical cocktail `of lead, cadmium and arsenic to Russia on the cargo ship

I think that we are all aware—whether it is a nuclear industry or anything else in Russia—of the state of collapse of government structures, the unemployment of skilled people, and the threat to any kind of environmental controls there, that indicate that Russia, on some level, should be treated as a developing nation at the moment.

        Greenpeace was putting its concerns on the record that Australian legislation was not up with the pace. What has been happening, of course, in the developing world is an increasing ability to recycle and an increasing penetration of those markets. Australia, as a developed country, would not like to do some of these things here these days, and there is an option to go into these countries.

        Similarly, we can look at the problem in one of its own corporations in one particular nation. In an article by Joshua Karliner in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Ecologist
        </emphasis>
        in March 1994, a company, Waste Management Technologies (WMX), described in 1991 as the 89th among global corporations in terms of revenue with 64,000 employees, making it the 66th largest corporation employer in the world—quite a sizeable operation—in 1992 WMX's subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, pleaded guilty to six felony violations for, as the article said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . failure to notify the United States when reportable quantities of hazardous substance were released into the environment.

       <para>
        That was within the United States. The article further stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        After reviewing such evidence, a lengthy report by the San Diego District Attorney concluded that WMX's history presented a "combination of environmental and anti&amp;hyphen;trust violations and public corruption cases which must be viewed with considerable concern".
       </para>
       <para>
        So there we have a major global corporation within the United States undertaking very serious and hazardous activity. We have to be even more concerned when we look around the world at the lack of infrastructure in a large number of developing and underdeveloped countries, and at their total inability to police these kinds of movements, or to ensure that their own residents are protected—as demonstrated by the desperation of civil servants in a lot of these countries, such as in all of Africa at the moment. You go through half of those countries and the public servants are not paid for months on end.

        The previous speaker referred to Alan Oxley's comments which, of course, show a certain emphasis in this policy area. It was illuminating to look at some of the debate around the earlier attempt by Norway to totally ban the movement. And whilst that was a contentious measure, it was quite alarming, I think, to see the attitude of a number of employer groups in this country.

         The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry spoke in rather rhetorical terms about eco&amp;hyphen;colonialism. I quote from a media release dated 22 September 1995 in which the ACCI said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The G77 countries stood up to the eco&amp;hyphen;colonialists and insisted on their rights to national sovereignty.

        </para>
        <para>
         It went on to deplore the Basel conference decisions, saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . the definitions of hazardous waste in the Convention are so loose as to catch many valuable secondary materials such as scrap steel, glass and paper and prevent their trade . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         It then went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . it assumes non&amp;hyphen;OECD countries are not able to regulate their own industries.
        </para>
        <para>
         The ACCI then conveniently cited a few countries that none of us would dispute are ahead of the pack, such as Singapore and Israel—I think Brazil is more questionable—but it left out a large number of non&amp;hyphen;OECD countries that are not really up to the mark in these areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This was part of a fairly trenchant attack by Australian industry on aspects of the Basel convention, putting forward the proposition, essentially, that to put any restrictions on these countries was a repetition of colonialism and an attempt by the Western world to dominate their internal institutions. We are quite aware that in a large number of these countries the people, essentially, have no say in the first place. So that proposition is extremely dangerous.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The ACCI further commented, on 20 September last year, that this whole thrust by the international community `establishes arbitrary and inequitable geographical and regional trading barriers (OECD/non&amp;hyphen;OECD)'; that it `will not achieve the objective of environmentally sound management'; that it `will deprive rapidly industrialising non&amp;hyphen;OECD countries of much&amp;hyphen;needed secondary raw materials'; and that `the full implications of a trade ban in secondary raw materials cannot be known until the scope of the Basel Convention has been properly clarified through extensive technical work'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That media release was endorsed by a large number of fairly major players in Australian industry—including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—and a number of international bodies such as the Indian Non&amp;hyphen;Ferrous Metals Association and US Business Recycling Coalition. What they are trying to say is that we, in the Western world, should not in any way try to ensure that there is proper protection of the populations of these countries and that the ability of institutions to recycle and destroy these hazardous materials should be up to a certain standard. It is interesting to note, in contrast, the reality, when we saw the World Bank a fortnight ago deploring Indonesia's increase in the minimum wage. So we have a situation where it is all right for the World Bank and it is all right for other international banking institutions to dictate industrial relations and to attack efforts by the ILO and other bodies to raise living standards, wage standards and occupational, health and safety standards; but it is the end of the world and it is totally atrocious that environmental groups would seek, externally, to try to do something in relation to these areas.

         The legislation, as other members have described, sets up a technical committee to give advice to the minister. It ensures, for instance, that there is insurance; it increases the penalties on companies; it tightens up in the area of liability within corporations; and, essentially, it allows an exemption with proper safeguards for movement. It allows the one permit to last the year in a number of cases. All of these things are matters on which there would be broad agreement. I support the legislation. As indicated, there is a responsibility by this country and

          the Western world to make sure that we are attempting to go towards minimisation. The thrust should not be, basically, to say that we can throw the problem sideways to those countries that are so desperate in fields like recycling or taking these products regardless of their danger.

         —in reply—I have pleasure in summing up the debate on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill which has been conducted over two sittings of the Main Committee. I thank honourable members for their contributions. This legislation gives effect to Australia's decision back in 1989 to sign the Basel convention, which has been articulated by the two previous speakers. It is one of the three multilateral environmental agreements that Australia subscribes to, the other two being the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

        This piece of legislation has gone through extensive consultation. It enjoys the support of all parties. As I said, it gives effect to the 1989 act which the then opposition supported and, indeed, listening to the two previous speakers, there were examples given in the 1989 consideration of the legislation which have a ring of familiarity about them. On that occasion, members might recall, there was a vessel called the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Khian Sea

        which left Philadelphia in about August 1986, and was still at sea in November 1988, sailing the world looking for somewhere to unload its cargo, which was a toxic acid and ash waste from incinerators. They were particular examples that, at that stage, made the parliament feel that we needed to subscribe to the Basel convention, and we did.

        Some issues were raised by members, who will be aware that the government intends to achieve suitable budget outcomes which has necessitated putting all programs under scrutiny, including the EPA. I think the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) mentioned the EPA, and I know the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) also mentioned it. The government is well aware of the importance of ensuring that its statutory obligations, also created under our agreement to this bill, are given the necessary resources. Savings measures will obviously be managed in ways that ensure that those statutory obligations are met, so I hope that will allay your fears.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Kingston (Ms Jeanes) described some past practices of Australia's trade in hazardous wastes; in particular the export of used acid batteries to developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia—I think the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) cited Papua New Guinea as well—where inadequate processing had led to exposure of local populations to elevated lead levels in the air. They are quite right in noting that all the amendments will bring such activities under control, and that is the primary purpose of the bill to which the parliament is now subscribing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also worth noting that the debate in Australia surrounding the convention and proposals for amending the act has led to voluntary action by several Australian companies to restrain exports of hazardous wastes to developing countries. There has already been a significant shift in Australia's pattern of trade in hazardous wastes. I am sure that will be welcomed by everybody, but it does require us to be continually vigilant in this regard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        More broadly, the government has made a commitment to reducing amounts of waste going into landfill in Australia and is developing a comprehensive program with the states and territories to deliver that goal. That was a point made by the member for Scullin, in particular.
        <break page="1802" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         An important part of that program is the development of an awareness program which can help to change attitudes in Australia and so go some way to bringing about the attitudinal and behavioural changes needed if levels of waste generated in Australia are to be reduced.

        The honourable member for Prospect argued that the bill merely catches up with international opinion and does not take Australia into the lead. I fundamentally disagree—and I did not hear any other member of the opposition make that observation. With this legislation, so far as we can determine, Australia will be complying more conscientiously with the requirements of the Basel convention than any other country. Further, we will have more rigorous technical processes in support of our regulatory controls—which I detailed in a lengthy second reading speech to the chamber—and the most open and transparent system of decision making, and that is an important consideration in an area of such sensitivity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will have very tight controls over exports for final disposal, controls which go beyond what the convention actually requires. There is no doubt in my mind nor, indeed, in the government's mind that Australia will be a leader in its implementation of the convention. On a related point, there is some suggestion that the government has been swayed more by trade interests than by environmental interests in drafting this bill. I should remind members that this bill was drafted by the opposition when in government and has gone forward unchanged, apart from two amendments made in the Senate. Further, the second reading speech which I delivered was very similar to that used by the minister of the former government when introducing this legislation into the parliament. So, if there are any sins, I guess we all share them. You will be pleased that I have attributed the work to the previous minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that if honourable members look carefully at the legislation and second reading speech they will see that what we have here is a very careful reconciling of the balance of different interests; in particular, environmental and trade ones. It is because those interests have been so carefully balanced that this government decided to proceed with the bill without further amendment. Indeed, the debate about trade and environment is a very active one, amply illustrated by the quotations that were made from the debate that was going on between Mr Oxley and another.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is a very active debate, and the Basel convention is an example of that debate. We can use the convention in some ways as a test case now in order to find solutions which provide the best level of environment protection for the vulnerable without imposing unnecessary constraints upon trade. Australia, once this bill is passed, will have put itself in a position where it is actually in front of the argument and will be able to actively contribute to the development of the international debate that is taking place in these very important and complex areas.

        It would be appropriate to pay tribute to the departmental officers who have worked in this area, because it is a very complex piece of legislation and has taken a considerable amount of time and wide consultation—and not just within Australia—to reach the position that we have today. It is good to see that it has been achieved by the departmental officers involved. One in particular happens to be sitting here: Mr Hyman needs to be congratulated for the work that he has done. I therefore have pleasure in commending the bill to the chamber for further consideration if necessary.

         —To continue: as a result, over 600 applications for listing particular products for supply in Australia have been delayed, which has incurred considerable financial distress for the applicants waiting to have their products listed prior to marketing. These applications comprise relatively simple, low risk products such as vitamin, mineral, herbal, homoeopathic and sunscreen products. The government believes that, given the long gestation of this bill, it is in the public interest to relieve this financial distress as soon as possible. The provisions of this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, ARTG.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new process will significantly reduce product approval times to a matter of weeks without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products. Under the new scheme, products must meet the same criteria as currently exist. These criteria include a statement that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, being the purposes identified in the application for marketing and not other purposes which go beyond the accepted indications for the therapeutic uses of the product.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods which have been identified in its first five years of operation. A mechanism to address shortages or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation.

Also included in this bill are provisions to permit warrantless entry of premises to seize goods, but limiting this power to situations where there is an imminent public health risk of death or serious injury, and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that illegal activity is taking place.

         A definition for food has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs.

The words `prescribed dose' and `frequency of administration' included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages.

         The bill also corrects a defect in the legislation regarding the ability of the secretary of the Department of Health and Family Services to approve the inclusion on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods products for export only where those products have been refused marketing approval in Australia. In these circumstances, the secretary is currently empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods. This power is, however, limited to goods that have been manufactured in Australia for export only and does not extend to products imported into Australia solely for re&amp;hyphen;export.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill proposes that this provision be amended to ensure that the secretary's ability to require confirmation from Australia's trading partners of their willingness to accept goods refused marketing approval in Australia extends to all products, irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in Australia or elsewhere.

        One reason why the therapeutic goods industry is so keen to have this legislation enacted is that this bill will implement a much speedier process for dealing with goods that come under the administration of the act. As the minister indicated, it is understood that there are about 600 applications waiting for listing under the provisions of the act. I appreciate the minister's assurances that despite the fact that the provisions of the act will allow goods that are applying for listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to be considered and then listed
        <break page="1805" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         within a period of a few weeks—a much shorter period than under the current process—this new process will not affect the quality or the safety of the products concerned. That is an assurance the parliament would expect to get from the minister.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One significant change in the bill is that it now includes Senator Harradine's amendment, which requires that drugs within a certain category have the specific approval of the Minister for Health. Unfortunately, some people are claiming that Senator Harradine's amendment bans the trial or marketing of any of the drugs that fall within the particular category of abortifacients, for example, RU486. Senator Harradine's amendment should not be changed or demonised in some way; it does not ban those sorts of drugs, whatever people might feel about the worth of such a ban. The amendment simply requires the drugs to be put in a special category and these drugs will require direct ministerial approval for further trials or marketing. The Labor Party does not think it is unreasonable that these drugs are put in that category. It is in accordance with undertakings that were given by previous Labor ministers and we are not opposed to the measures that Senator Harradine has successfully moved in the Senate.

        As a result of that, the government will be reviewing the workings of the bill and reviewing the bill in consultation with the appropriate industries, some members of whom I see in the gallery here today, and we hope to do that in the fairly near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a commitment by Senator Woods that the government will be conducting a review of the provisions of the act and the way that the act is worked. The statement was made there that it would be conducted in the `fairly near future'. Could the officials in the gallery, or whoever is summing up for the government, convey to the minister that it would be a help if we had some form of timetable so that we know when that review will be initiated, and when it is expected that the review will be completed so that people can have some idea as to what time frame we are working in. Given that the government has stated that that will be completed in the fairly near future, I assume it will be one that will be relatively focused but one, I hope, that will allow for wide consultation before any recommendations are made to the government.
