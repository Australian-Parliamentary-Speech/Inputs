          —The inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder involved this committee in a great deal of controversy—far more than we expected when we undertook to investigate the proposal. After discussions with representatives of Pedder 2000 last year, members from all parties agreed that a parliamentary inquiry was warranted. This was because the proposal was a matter that had potential consequences for the future management of the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area, which of course is the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the government of Tasmania.

          Although individual opinions about the proposal varied enormously, members of the committee agreed that a dispassionate study of all sides of the issue would not only lead to a reasonable conclusion but also would be a low cost method of considering the issue. We strove to conduct the inquiry in a speedy and even-handed manner, so we could report fairly and as early as possible.

          However, the inquiry generated wild controversy in which some seriously misjudged and sometimes quite untrue assertions were made. The committee was attacked from many sides and outrageous claims were made about the cost of the inquiry. Some people claimed that the Commonwealth government must have instigated the inquiry for some hidden political reason. I would like to make it quite clear that the decision to undertake the inquiry was entirely the committee's own and unanimously agreed. Nevertheless, a great deal of considered evidence was presented during the inquiry, both in submissions and by witnesses at the public hearings. The committee appreciated the effort which the main proponents from both sides of the argument put into gathering, preparing and presenting the material. Inevitably there were strong conflicts and sharp contrasts in the perspectives of the witnesses.

          In summary, our key findings are that the proposal is technically feasible and that if implemented it would enhance the World Heritage values of the area, although there is a risk that these values would be diminished while the area is rehabilitated. There could be a net financial cost to the Tasmanian community. There is little likelihood of the proposal proceeding in the foreseeable future and, more importantly, there are other environmental tasks that have much higher priority. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to allocate resources to the further consideration of the proposal at this time. It was generally agreed that the geomorphological features would survive draining, as would the peat mat that originally covered the area. Most witnesses accepted that, while an exact restoration of the pre-flooding ecology was no longer possible, an acceptable rehabilitation was probable with an unknown degree of human intervention to avoid problems such as erosion.

          The committee does not doubt that the unique and stunning features of the original Lake Pedder are still intact under the water and that if the waters of the new lake were drained they would re-emerge as a fully functioning, integrated landscape. However, at present, there is simply not sufficient technical information available for such an undertaking to proceed. A great many questions remain unanswered about the risks and costs that might be involved in the draining process and in successfully rehabilitating an enormous tract of land that has been submerged for 23 years.

          Significant costs could be involved in breaching or installing a spillway on one of the dams as well as in providing new infrastructure. There would be a marginal reduction in the capacity of the hydro-electric system, although with current demand the loss could be accommodated.

          I share the disappointment of those who loved and lost the original lake and believe that the decision to flood was an appalling mistake. It was clear from the evidence of those who had visited the lake that its aesthetic and spiritual pull is still strongly felt. I personally do not doubt that if a restoration project on such a scale as this were undertaken it would attract enormous interest worldwide. However, the element of risk could have serious financial implications for the government since, once the process had begun, the commitment would be irrevocable. At present, the proposal is opposed by both the government and the opposition parties in Tasmania. So it would have no real prospect of proceeding in the foreseeable future.

          There are many more compelling and urgent environmental priorities. It would be inappropriate to allocate Commonwealth resources to further development of the Lake Pedder proposal. We must give the highest priority to urgent national tasks, such as establishing a nationwide system of protected areas in which a high proportion of the nation's ecological and biological diversity is represented.

          Many other urgent environmental problems were identified to the committee. We would not be acting responsibly if we recommended diverting resources from tasks such as these. Lake Pedder is, for the time being at least, safe under the waters of the impoundment, and its memory is alive in the hearts of its admirers. Given the interest that the inquiry has generated, particularly in Tasmania, the committee hurried to prepare this report so that we could present it to the parliament before it rises for the winter recess.

          I am grateful that, despite their differences in attitude and orientation, members of the committee were willing to make a concerted effort to reach an agreed conclusion. I would like to warmly praise the efficient organisation of the inquiry by Ian Dundas, Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons and to recognise the crucial importance of their effective and lucid drafting, which provided an outstanding basis for the committee's final consideration of the report. I commend the report to the House.

I also commend the staff—Ian Dundas, Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons—on their work. I recall that there were 171 submissions and 60 witnesses. There was a time constraint, as the honourable member has referred to. It is important that the report be released now before the winter recess.

          Two fundamental facts have to be kept in mind when one is considering this proposal. The first of those is that the original Lake Pedder was only 10 square kilometres, including the dunes. The enlarged Lake Pedder is 242 square kilometres, and the question of the restoration of the original lake is not an issue. It is the other 230 square kilometres that is the issue with regard to restoration. Secondly, this area became part of the World Heritage listings in 1982, which was 10 years after the original Lake Pedder was flooded. That World Heritage listing was further strengthened in 1989. So the question of World Heritage listing is also not an issue.

          The committee recommendation is quite definite. That recommendation is not only to not proceed but also to not provide any funds for any further studies. Even amongst environmentalists such studies have a low priority. There are far more important things to be done with the environment in Australia, or about which to even provide finance for consideration, than become involved in the case of Lake Pedder.

I have no regrets at all as a member of the committee. I also disagree with comments he made in a press release when he said that it was an appalling mistake that the original Lake Pedder was flooded. I do not believe it was an appalling mistake.

          My regret is that the inquiry itself took place. I acknowledge that I did support the inquiry because I believed the situation was such that it had to occur. But what that inquiry has done is reopen some old wounds in Tasmania. It has created a divisive situation at a time of economic difficulty in Tasmania. It has frightened potential investment by creating doubt over one of Tasmania's major assets—that is, environmentally friendly hydro-electric power.

          I disagree with the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) when he says in his dissenting report that we spend too much time on economic cost, but I acknowledge the sincerity of the member. I believe we did not spend enough time on economic cost, particularly the broader element of the total cost to the Tasmanian economy of any draining of Lake Pedder. In the narrowest context, we considered the cost of draining and trying to restore the 230 square kilometres which are presently flooded—that is, those 230 square kilometres of button grass plains. The report indicates the uncertainties of success and potential costs.

          —I am pleased to table the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into the adequacy of protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth government and its agencies. The committee's inquiry found that the handling of confidential third party information, both personal and commercial, is exercised with varying degrees of efficiency across different agencies. Those agencies which hold the most sensitive confidential information tend to have better developed systems for its protection. In general, however, the committee found that the protections afforded to such information are neither comprehensive nor reliable.

          The roles of the agency head and senior managers in the protection of third party information were closely considered by the committee. The committee made several recommendations which will give the group more express responsibility for implementing and promoting privacy and related security protections within an agency. In particular, the senior managers of Commonwealth agencies must do more to foster and nurture a privacy culture. It is disappointing to see that, more than six years after the commencement of the Privacy Act, incidents are reported on a regular basis that are indicative of a significant breach of privacy principles.

          The committee also considered the application of the criminal law in relation to Commonwealth officials who wrongly disclose third party information as well as persons who procure and deal in the wrongful disclosure of such information. The committee recommends that unauthorised dealings in third party information should be prohibited at every point on the distribution chain by general offence provisions in the Crimes Act. `Unauthorised dealings' include at least the following conduct: unauthorised access; unauthorised use, including disclosing and recording; procuring or soliciting; offering to supply; and publishing.

          General offence provisions avoid the situation where officers disclosing and persons soliciting information obtained under one enactment may face prosecution, while officers who disclose and persons soliciting information obtained under a different enactment may not be subject to criminal sanctions at all. Location in the Crimes Act indicates the seriousness with which the offences are viewed and contributes to community perception of the gravity of the offence. It is to be hoped that this perception may act as a greater deterrent to unauthorised dealings in confidential third party information and may further reinforce the development of a privacy culture.

          Finally, the need for a national privacy code was addressed in the report, and the committee recommended that a national privacy code should be established. A national code would provide a consistent approach to privacy principles. Consistent application of these principles is important to individuals in their dealings with both the private and public sectors. There are also advantages to the private sector in having consistent standards for the protection of confidential information rather than several different sets of rules. The privatisation of Commonwealth agencies has had the result that those instrumentalities are no longer subject to the Privacy Act. Telecom is also no longer subject to the Privacy Act. It would be desirable for all Commonwealth agencies to be subject to consistent privacy standards.

          This is a report of the committee's inquiry into the implications for industry arising out of the year 2000 Olympic Games. The staging of the 2000 Olympic Games presents Australia with a magnificent opportunity to display its prowess across the spectrum of industry to the largest international audience in history. I give special thanks to the members of the committee and also to the secretariat, especially Paul McMahon, Brendhan Egan, Frances Wilson and Mr Justin Winton.

          In relation to strategic opportunities, preparing and staging the games will add over $7 billion to Australia's GDP over the next decade. Clearly, the Olympic Games will have a positive impact on Australia's economy and there will be opportunities across the spectrum of Australian industry. The tourism industry, which is already experiencing tremendous growth, has a major opportunity to benefit from the Sydney Olympic Games. The Olympics will be a significant tourism event. Government action could, however, help in the following areas: additional funds for a marketing campaign based around the games, detailed research to be undertaken into the likely impact of the Olympics on Australian tourism and, to assist the meetings and exhibition industries, the development of multi-purpose venues should be investigated.

          At the 2000 games Australia will judged not only in a sporting context but also on the construction of venues and other infrastructure. There is a major challenge but also a great opportunity in the games construction program. There is considerable potential for new technology to be developed and promoted in association with the Olympic Games. This is one of the great benefits of winning the right to host the games. Ultimately, however, the decision to proceed with new technology for developments associated with the games must be balanced against budgetary constraints.

          A key feature of the Sydney Olympic bid was the adoption of environmental guidelines. If the environmental guidelines are successfully implemented, opportunities will be created for Australian industry to be at the forefront of meeting a rapidly expanding world demand for environmental goods and services. Commonwealth monitoring of adherence to the games' environmental guidelines is recommended by the committee to provide an independent public assessment of their implementation.

          Australia's sporting capabilities are recognised around the world. In our own region there is growing interest in sports development. We have expertise in sporting technology, which is a highly marketable commodity in the Asia-Pacific area. The awarding of the 2000 Olympic Games to Sydney offers opportunities for significantly improving links with the Asia-Pacific region in sport and, through these links, opportunities for improved commercial, social and economic relations. The committee believes that existing efforts to build export markets for sporting goods and services should be given a higher priority by the Commonwealth government in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games.

          A number of submissions to the committee commented on Olympic Games merchandising and the strong feeling in the community that games related merchandise should be Australian made. The committee believes that in the long term the high visibility of Australian-made products at the Sydney Olympics could have a considerable positive effect on Australia's manufacturing image overseas. However, legislating a mandatory Australian-made regime may create problems when necessary items are not produced here and could cause difficulties with the Olympic `top' sponsorship arrangements. Such legislation would also have revenue implications for SOCOG and could result in higher prices. A preferable alternative would be for SOCOG to provide interested parties with access to a list of companies and individuals given licences to use Sydney Olympic Games symbols and terminology.

          To help maintain commitment to Australian industry, the committee has recommended that the level of Australian industry involvement in the Sydney Olympic Games should be documented and that information should be made available to the New South Wales parliament. Initiatives of the New South Wales government such as the Olympic Business Information Service and a number of seminars and conferences on the Olympic Games have helped to improve industry's access to information on the Sydney Olympics.

          The committee believes, however, that more should be done. There is considerable potential in the area with recent government initiatives in the area of electronic commerce and the provision of information on industry support programs in electronic form. Commonwealth initiatives such as Bizhelp, if linked with the New South Wales government's OBIS and ideally an electronic commerce system, would provide industry with better access to information on the Olympic Games and at the same time information on any relevant government assistance programs. Olympic Games one-stop shops across Australia, operating from existing information services offices and utilising on-line information, are also recommended.

          The committee believes that industry has a right to expect that all levels of government will be working together to maximise the opportunities from the Olympic Games. The promotion of ideas and discussions with and within industry, as well as a coordinated response to Olympic Games opportunities, will be facilitated by the establishment by the New South Wales government of the Olympic Business Roundtable. The committee is keen to see that this body truly has a national focus. The inclusion in its membership of the Isonet representative and more business people of national significance, with some coming from outside Sydney, would also be of assistance in this regard.

          In relation to the application of procurement policy, the committee believes that the New South Wales government initiatives to maximise Australian industry involvement in the Olympic Games are more than adequate. The only major practical improvements would be the extension of electronic commerce services; the inclusion of a statement on small to medium enterprises in the guidelines for local industry participation and plans; and the adoption of two-envelope tendering procedures, which include a separate envelope for industry development proposals associated with a tender.

          In conclusion, the committee believes that if the Olympic organisers, the state governments and the Commonwealth government can cooperate to provide industry with coordination, information, a forum for the promotion and discussion of ideas and Olympic issues, and a fair procurement regime, Australian industry can gain considerable benefit from the Olympic Games.

          Industry as a whole will benefit as a result of the flow-on effects of the implementation and the conduct of the Olympics in Sydney.

          The major beneficiaries of the Olympics 2000 will be the people of Australia. The flow-on effects of the publicity and the tourism campaign, which will be launched overseas following the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, will bring tourists to Australia for many years to come after the Olympics have been held in Sydney. The ultimate aim of the Olympics is to maximise the tourism benefit and all the other industry flow-on effects that should be forthcoming as a result of a successful Olympics 2000.

          One of the recommendations which the committee has put forward is that an international sports and industry trade fair be conducted in a capital city in Australia in 1999. I believe that this will be the opportunity for Australian industries and sporting goods manufacturers to show their capacity and expertise in producing products which can be used throughout the world. I expect that will attract a great deal of attention in the lead-up to the Olympics in Sydney. It also will highlight the development of the skills of Australian people, particularly in the manufacture of product, and their sporting expertise will be well visible through the lead-up to the Olympic Games.

So many new technologies will come into play in the lead-up to the games with the rapid development of broadcasting technology. Australia will be able, and innovative enough, to capitalise on all of the advances in broadcasting technology and bring them to their fulfilment during the conduct of the Sydney Olympics. I believe this document has gone a long way towards alerting industry to the magnificent opportunities available.

         The report I have just tabled brings together the outcomes of the Acapulco meeting and records the delegation's impressions gained during its visits to Chile and Barbados. I should say at the outset that I am grateful to the other members of the delegation—the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who served with distinction as deputy leader; the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth); and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss)—for their contributions to the success of the delegation. I do not think a delegation could have left these shores and served in a more cohesive and effective way than our delegation. I think that, across the parliament, it was a real example of the way that good work can be done in a constructive and effective fashion.

Georgia went for a holiday to her grandparents in Hobart while we were away.

In both countries, the delegation was impressed by the warmth of the hospitality extended and was particularly grateful for the courtesies shown to the accompanying spouses. The delegation was well prepared prior to departure and is very grateful for the support provided by officers of the Parliamentary Relations Office, the Parliamentary Library, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade and AusAID.

         Mr Speaker, time precludes a detailed survey of the issues raised in the delegation's report. In brief, however, the delegation is optimistic for the future of the APPF, particularly following the organisational reforms pushed through so energetically in the executive committee by you. Certain administrative difficulties remain to be overcome in the conduct of the annual meeting, and I understand that this parliament is assisting in establishing conference procedures to overcome these.

         The delegation recommends that participation by an Australian delegation in the APPF meetings be a permanent inclusion in the annual schedule of outgoing parliamentary delegations.

The delegation strongly recommends to the parliament that we should find a method of having some degree of continuity in our delegation to the APPF.

         I turn to the bilateral visits. The report chronicles in some detail the nature and extent of discussions held in both countries. As a general comment to cover both bilateral relationships, the delegation came to query the extent to which Australian business is sufficiently energetic, enterprising and enthusiastic in opening and pursuing trade opportunities through Chile to the wider South American market and through Barbados to the wider Caribbean community. In both potential markets, the key issue is transportation.

         In the case of Chile, the delegation makes the strong recommendation that urgent action should be taken by the government to conclude air services negotiations as soon as possible. In the delegation's view, the imminent float of Qantas should no longer be used to screen inaction. They are strong words, but each member of the delegation believes strongly that Australia has been dragging its feet to some extent in this matter and that we should get on with the job. It is in our national interest to make sure that the communications across the South Pacific to Latin America should be greatly improved compared with what exists at present. The idea that we had to go via North America to get there is simply ludicrous in this day and age. Something has to be done about that urgently.

         The lead that Australia took in its approach to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Acapulco should be commented on a little further. A very large section of the report is devoted to what happened. We should endorse the remarks of the member for Makin in paying tribute to the Speaker. There is no doubt that, without the reforms that the APPF underwent at this session, there would have been some doubt as to the viability of it in the future. Australia led the way there; the Speaker led the way. It was very much the initiative of the Australian delegation and the hard work that was done that made this conference the success that I believe it was.

         The trip to Barbados and Chile was interesting and opened up some enormous opportunities for Australians. Australia is already earning a good reputation in the mining industry of Chile. There are tremendous opportunities in the communications industry and even the wine industry. In Barbados, although trade is not great at the moment, there are some very close Commonwealth ties and sporting ties. We all benefited very much from our activities there.

         I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Makin regarding air links between Australia and South America. Negotiations have been continuing for more than a decade and nothing has happened. I am upset that the New Zealanders have concluded an arrangement with Chile and it appears that Australia might have been beaten to that market. The opportunities for business in South America are absolutely enormous if we can get the air links right. As a matter or urgency the government to government arrangements and the airline to airline agreements should be concluded as soon as possible.

         To my mind, the constant theme of our visit to Chile was the tremendous can-do approach of the Chilean government. There has been a slowness in Australia to acknowledge the progress that has occurred in South America. We can no longer consider South America to be part of the Third World. It is a tremendously productive area which offers the threat and the challenge of being a major competitor to Australia in so many areas of our export expertise. Chile has the biggest copper mine in the world and is about to get a bigger one.

         Chile's attitude towards developments of this type is very positive indeed. The government of Chile has the view that if there is a way to achieve these sorts of things it will find it. South American countries are very much low tax countries and they are very proud of their low tax regime. I will never forget the telecommunications minister who was telling us with great enthusiasm about the seven telephone companies operating in Chile—a country with a similar population to that of Australia. When he was asked whether any tax was being placed upon these telecommunications companies he said, `No. We don't need any more tax revenue. The government has plenty of spare money. We burn'—he mentioned a figure; I forget how much it was—`cash each year.' This comes from a country with no social security system. Obviously the priorities are very different from ours.

The people of Barbados were never quite sure whether they were afraid of Shane Warne or whether the West Indies were going to belt him all around the island. They were eagerly looking forward to the contest. There is great warmth between Barbados and Australia.

         —The Public Service (Abolition of Compulsory Retirement Age) Amendment Bill 1995 will ensure that age alone is not a bar to a person joining the Public Service and to a person continuing to be employed in the Public Service. Currently, the Public Service Act imposes a mandatory retiring age of 65 with a limited, and not widely known, provision for staff beyond that age to be able to continue working at the secretary's discretion. The act also provides for an option to retire at an earlier age. Finally, the act provides a bar to certain appointments of persons aged over 65 for a period extending beyond that age.

         In 1992, I introduced a similar bill into this parliament which the government refused to give a second reading. I am introducing this bill because the government still, despite its many undertakings to the contrary, has not addressed the problem of employment related age discrimination. Employment related age discrimination pervades the labour market of Australia. Its existence is evident both in the continued use of mandatory retirement ages, and in the age based stereotypes which are used as an inappropriate proxy for assessment criteria such as capacity, performance and merit. These generalisations about older people's abilities, drive and enthusiasm militate against older people continuing in and gaining employment which undermines their right to equality of opportunity in our society.

         With the exception of Tasmania, all of the states and territories have enacted, or are taking steps to enact, some form of age discrimination legislation. The Commonwealth government has not followed suit. In a media release dated 30 September 1990, the then Minister for Social Security gave an undertaking to remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. In 1992, the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies,

        In 1993, the Attorney-General, through Senator Bolkus, indicated that `the Attorney-General's Department is working towards the development of a comprehensive Commonwealth age discrimination policy' and that the department would release a discussion paper `on the issues involved earlier next year'—that is, 1994. Despite these commitments, the government has continued to discriminate against its own employees. None of the promises have been acted on and the discussion paper still has not been released.

         Rather than eliminating age discrimination, the Commonwealth government has taken advantage of its unique status as an employer to avoid the anti-age discrimination provisions it has enacted for everybody else. The Industrial Reform Act 1993 provides that an employer must not terminate an employee's contract on account of a number of variables, including age. However, the Commonwealth government has successfully argued before the Industrial Relations Court that sections 73C, 76J and 76V of the Public Service Act, which provide that its employees may be compulsorily retired at age 65, are not affected by the reform act.

         —The purpose of the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation) Amendment Bill 1995 is to entrench in legislation the existing curfew which applies to Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. This bill has been brought forward by me not only on behalf of the coalition but also on behalf of many thousands of residents in suburbs such as Hunters Hill, Woolwich, North Ryde and Boronia Park, and also in suburbs closer to Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport, whose lives have been very directly affected by the unfair, discriminatory and punitive way in which the government has administered policy concerning Sydney airport since the opening of the third runway. In fact, its policy has ruined the lives of thousands of Sydney residents.

Other Sydney members, on both sides of the House, have also received a huge number of complaints. The people of Sydney are extremely angry with the federal government's handling of this issue. They know that they were misled about the noise levels that would be associated with the opening of the parallel runway. According to the official noise contour map, my electorate of Bennelong should be virtually unaffected by aircraft noise, but my constituents in Hunters Hill would say that the map is absolutely wrong, and they would be justified in their complaints.

If the government does not support the private members bill that I have put forward today, people in my electorate and elsewhere will be led to the conclusion that the government does intend to relax the curfew, that it will bow to pressure in order to obtain a higher return on the leasing of the airport and that it will otherwise deal in a deceitful and dishonourable fashion with the people of my electorate and the people of areas such as Leichhardt and Marrickville who are also very severely affected by the government's mishandling of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. It is a fair measure, and I commend it very warmly to the House.

Article 34, from which emanated the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994—an act passed unanimously by this parliament—calls on states parties to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation.

         The banning of the importation of goods made by child labour would be a step towards the implementation of other social clauses in trade arrangements under the World Trade Organisation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) consistently argues that there is a direct relationship between lack of formal training and education and an Australian worker's likelihood of being unemployed. As child labour is one of the greatest obstacles to schooling and potential to earn a future income, all on the government side should recommend its abolition.

         As far as the coalition is concerned I would have thought that, given the emotional position taken by a number of members to the sexual exploitation of children, opposition to the economic exploitation of children would be a fait accompli. In the United States the introduction of a child labour deterrence act by Senator Tom Harkin was so influential that importers took the telling step of labelling carpets as `child labour free'. As I mentioned on 19 September 1994 in a speech on this issue, in India, Pakistan and Nepal a labelling system is being introduced which identifies carpets not made by child labour.

         As one observer pointed out, `the main impetus for change comes from implicit threats of import bans from import countries'.

The prohibition of the importing of goods made by child labour is a step in the right direction.

         It reinforces the notion that the social relations of production are something that all countries have a stake in if they are truly international and outward looking. To admonish the old protectionists and derisively describe them as inward looking whilst at the same time resile from legislation aimed at protecting workers internationally is sheer hypocrisy. The exploitation of child labour occurs in the kind of deregulated market which most government members claim a coalition government would institute in Australia. We well remember the angst created when the coalition proposed a youth wage as part of its 1993 election campaign.

       For the whole of 1994 and early 1995 I had the great privilege of being the alternate leader of the Australian delegation involved in the preparatory committees for the world summit for social development. At those preparatory committee meetings, which were attended by most members of the UN and which lasted for a couple of weeks each, the Australian delegation and the United States delegation worked together very cooperatively. We had considerable agreement in the goal of reducing poverty, increasing employment and improving social solidarity. We agreed, too, on some of the detail about setting targets for the reduction of poverty and for the provision of improved services for people in impoverished countries. The US spoke very effectively in favour of gender equity and in quite practical terms.

        We agreed about the importance of giving high priority to Africa, where much of global poverty occurs. We were in agreement about the goal of increasing employment growth so that there is work for all. Those agreements demonstrated very effective cooperation in the UN context about the need for interdependent approaches to addressing global problems. We do not need to be reminded, I hope, that the extent of global interdependency is now very high—not only in the trade and investment areas but also very clearly in the last few years in financial markets, in communication and in the environment, because what one country does has a direct impact on the environmental conditions in another.

        It is therefore very sad indeed to see the proposals that are now being presented to the US Congress for reductions in funding for the UN and for reductions in US foreign aid, including its contributions to the international development banks. It is a fact that what has been proposed are devastating cuts. The Republican majority is proposing to reduce overseas aid by $2.2 billion, compared with the Clinton administration's request for 1996. They are proposing to abolish the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. That really is an expression of a much more isolationist stance within the Congress—at exactly the time when one would expect a greater recognition of the need for integration.

        One tragedy is that the US is already severely in arrears to the United Nations; in fact, it is the biggest debtor. At present, it owes about $700 million for peacekeeping. It owes—including its regular budget contributions, on which it is also in arrears—$1.2 billion in a total UN budget of around $4 billion or $5 billion. This is a huge deficit that the United States is causing. It is double the arrears of Russia, which owes $630 million. Some other countries are in arrears, but their arrears are minor in comparison.

        As well as that, it is not unfair to say that the US is very miserly in its contribution of overseas aid. In 1993 the US contributed 0.15 per cent of its GNP to overseas development assistance. Australia contributed 0.35 per cent, but even that is only half of the UN target of 0.7 per cent. Some countries exceeded the UN target. In 1983 the Netherlands—which is a country comparable with Australia—contributed 0.82 per cent. Canada, another country comparable with Australia, contributed 0.45 per cent; Germany contributed 0.37 per cent; and even Japan contributed 0.26 per cent. The US contributed only 0.15, well under half that of Australia and well under a quarter of the agreed UN target—which was reiterated at the social summit in Copenhagen.

        This is quite tragic. Not only is the world more interdependent but, in a post cold war period, there is a growth in turbulence, uncertainty and the risk of local conflicts exploding. In many countries there is, certainly, a continuation of the growth in poverty, inequity and real hardship. Those problems are, to some extent, interrelated and, to some extent, quite separate, but they need to be addressed in a concerted way by the global community. It is very damaging if, in that concerted drive to address those issues, the world's largest and leading country is saying, `We want to pull back.'

        It also leads to dangerous confusion. What should be the global approach to these issues? Is it appropriate to attempt agreed action to address these issues? It was striking to see at the G7 meeting in Halifax nine days ago that the G7 countries—the leading seven industrial nations of the world—said in their final communique, `We call upon member states to meet their financial obligations to the United Nations.' That is a very direct reprimand from the other six leading industrial countries to the US, which is the only country in that Group of Seven which is severely in arrears. As I have already said, it is much more in arrears than any other country.

        What is tending to happen is that we have a division of responsibility growing in the world, with the US increasing its military expenditure but massively reducing its peacekeeping and development assistance. It is playing a much more negative and reactive role while the European countries, Japan and Australia are contributing in a much more creative and positive way to global affairs so that problems are addressed before they lead to explosive conflict. A number of people have been making those kinds of remarks recently. There are very severe global consequences to the attitude in the US Congress at present.

        Fortunately, the US administration remains committed to international cooperation and is demonstrating that by its activities in the UN. It is attempting to do so through developmental assistance as well, but it will not be able to do so unless Congress agrees. One hopes that this isolationist tendency, therefore, will be much criticised and analysed and that alternatives are presented within the wider US community, where I think there is much greater humanitarian support for developmental assistance for poverty reduction.

        If that does not happen and if this tendency does not fairly quickly turn round, permanent damage will be done to the global community. Not only will economic development in impoverished companies be retarded, but financial and environmental and other kinds of conflicts will be exacerbated in ways that could cause long-term harm to the whole world. That would be a tragedy which we, in Australia, would be very opposed to. Australia, I am glad to say, has a strong record of both aid and support for the UN. Therefore, we can speak with some authority about these issues in relation to the United States.

We need to look further than the Republican Party majority and its increasing clashes with the White House and the Clinton administration on many national security, economic, societal and political issues. To provide a more balanced perspective, this motion needs not only to explore the machinations of Washington DC but also to look objectively further afield to the bureaucratic and organisational confusion and the unrealistic—some might say `blinkered'—vision that radiates from UN headquarters in New York.

        In my limited time today I want to concentrate briefly on peacekeeping from the viewpoint both of the US Congress and of the United Nations. There is little doubt that—despite some notable successes in El Salvador, Namibia and Cambodia in recent years—UN peacekeeping is in crisis. The crisis is both conceptual and practical. In recent years, many principles and practices have been tried, have been tested, have been modified and, in some cases, have dismally failed. There have been repeated difficulties in the control and management of peacekeeping operations, with the distinction between peacekeeping and enforcement activities inevitably blurred.

        Most recently, UN efforts in Bosnia have exposed the UN to accusations not only of basic weakness but of a failure to protect fundamental human rights and dignity. In the extreme, some peacekeeping operations such as those in Angola have been followed by a resumption of war. Others like Somalia and Rwanda, in response to humanitarian crises, have been painfully and tragically slow, with limited long-term benefits. One thing is very clear: the range of conflicts around the globe far exceeds the UN's capacity to address it.

        Some states have imposed evasive and confrontationist participatory conditions, while there have been accusations of bias in some UN quarters on the method and rationale for involvement in some specific crises. Proposals to place forces at the general disposal of the UN have failed, and peacekeeping finances remain in a mess for a number of reasons, not only ambivalence by the US Congress, as this motion might of itself imply. As Dick Thornburgh said, in assessing the situation from an outside viewpoint for President Bush, setting up a UN peacekeeping operation is aptly called a `financial bungee jump' of continuous risk and crisis.

        By contrast, over 150 states, including Australia, are apportioned for peacekeeping at one-tenth or one-fifth of their regular UN dues.

Turning to US domestic politics, two acts of Congress and Presidential Decision Directive 25, PDD25, provide a basis for US participation in UN peace operations. The UN Participation Act 1945 as amended states that a maximum of 1,000 US armed forces personnel can be detailed to the United Nations in non-combat roles to help peacefully resolve disputes. The act also authorises the President to negotiate agreements with the Security Council, subject to the approval of Congress, to provide armed forces to the United Nations acting under chapter 7 to maintain international peace and security.

        —A few points have been made and some of them are agreed to by both sides of the House. Firstly, I refer to the substantial financial problems of the United Nations. In August 1994 Boutros Boutros-Ghali noted debts of $1.7 billion and said that $1 billion was owed to 75 countries for peacekeeping and $400 million to vendors and suppliers. That should be seen in the context of the devaluation of the US dollar since 1946, which leads to a situation whereby in 1995 in real terms the dollar budget has only increased eight times. If we look at the substantial change in operations and the broad agenda that the United Nations now fulfils, that puts the debt in some context. It is certainly a matter of deep division in US politics. It was stated by New York Democrat Gary Ackerman:

The other side of the coin was very succinctly put by Madeleine Albright, the UN representative, when she said:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       By mobilising the support of other nations and leveraging our resources through alliances in international institutions, we can achieve important objectives without asking our armed forces to bear all the risks or our taxpayers to pay all the bills.

       What we are seeing in America is a debate as to the degree to which the United Nations follows US foreign policy. In contrast to the Republican view, in recent decades we have seen a range of United States successes through the United Nations. They range from the nuclear non-proliferation work and the United States efforts on human rights around the world, and they encompass the intervention in Haiti—something which the previous Republican administration failed to take any interest in as regards intervention in Panama and Grenada. Yet the United States actually accomplished UN support for that intervention.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Similarly, in regard to Iraq, we have seen the United States, by this leverage that Albright talked about, influence world opinion. There have been the sanctions on Libya. The United States has a substantial range of foreign policy interests, endorsed by the United Nations. That is the direction in which the current administration believes the United States policy should go.

        In contrast with the Republicans, we have a very substantial movement away from aid. It is all right to say that this is just a matter of their perhaps having legitimate concerns. There is a very broad agenda—an agenda to cut population policies unless China is given no aid. There is an agenda to expand NATO and to have a 40 per cent aid cut in general. It is very important to note that when there is such a concern about what is wrong—the waste, et cetera—Israel and Egypt will remain exempt in this massive cut in aid.

        The United States is continuing its pursuit of Star Wars technology. That is being pushed in a very real sense by the Republicans in Congress. There is the issue of any country having the effrontery to continue Cuban economic contacts. There is the attempt to approve US troops for Syria and Egypt.

        Substantially, I believe that the Republican Party, exploiting a lack of knowledge of the foreign aid commitments of the United States, is attempting to seize that agenda in foreign policy. It is worth noting that, in an article in the

        of 30 April 1995, 41 per cent of Americans thought that foreign aid was the largest ingredient in the US budget. However, when Americans were asked whether the level should be increased to one per cent—the level is only 0.015 per cent at the moment—48 per cent of Americans thought that one per cent was a reasonable level, 16 per cent said it was way too little and 18 per cent said it was a bit too little.

        It is very interesting to note the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr Boutros-Ghali. He was quoted last weekend saying that the United Nations is basically broke and that, unless the United Nations receives financial support from its members, it will have trouble achieving its goals. This is a very serious matter that we should be looking at. As we have already heard today, United Nations members owe the UN in the order of $2.8 billion, of which about $1.9 billion is for peacekeeping purposes. It is also true that the United States owes a great deal—in fact, probably something more than $1 billion—and this we should be pressing them to pay.

        The UN was even referred to as being easily seen as an `insatiable bloated monster'.

I think this is an issue that we ought to be having a look at, as well as other matters that have been raised in this debate.

        I also noticed with some interest that, while being critical of the United States, the member for Fraser was also critical of his own government when it came to the level of foreign aid. He pointed out that, while the government's policy for some years has been to increase Australia's foreign aid to 0.4 per cent, it cannot even achieve that at the moment. That clearly shows that his own government deserves the criticism that he seems to be handing out to it.

We are entitled as a country that has joined with the United States in many peacekeeping operations over this century—we have fought wars on behalf of other peoples; we have contributed greatly from our own nation's wealth to the benefit of other people around the world—to say to the United States: please reconsider your direction and provide that strong leadership that you have provided in the past.

When you look around at some of the contributions to peacekeeping forces in recent times, some have been successful—I think they have been noted by members—but we have also sent peacekeeping forces to a lot of areas where I would question whether or not their role was more one of peacemaking.

        It does concern me, when we are talking about peacekeeping, that we actually look in international terms at areas where people actually do want to solve their differences and solve their problems. Until the United Nations peacekeepers tackle roles where we can achieve some result from peacekeeping, we need to have a look at the overall approach. I am not taking away from that. I know there will be people who will say, `Shock, horror. Fancy anybody standing up and talking about systems on the basis of peacekeeping. We need to solve the problems in these countries.' I am not denying that but, having spent a number of years in the services as a soldier, I know what it is like at the other end of it. I think that a lot of people who get up and use fine words about how we are going to solve problems need to look at the lives of the people we are sending into those areas to solve those problems as well.

       This private member's motion had its genesis in a question asked by the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) on 1 March of this year, towards the end of the height of the fruit picking season in southern Australia. The member for Mallee asked the question of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). He said:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I have no need to remind the minister that over 800,000 people are unemployed in this country and that countless numbers again are underemployed. Why, then, are horticulturalists currently having enormous difficulty in attracting harvest labour? I am referring to grape growers, vegetable growers and stone fruit growers in the Murray Valley, the Goulburn Valley and all across Australia.

       The member for Mallee's question was pivotal in drawing the attention of the House and of Australian taxpayers to an enormous inequity in our present employment schedule. With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, blind Freddy could tell you that to raise a motion like this in the House is a hazardous course because, as soon as one mentions what happens to the unemployed and the opportunity that there is for harvest labour, one runs the risk of being accused of in some way wanting to be exploitative, wanting to reintroduce some form of slave labour and take the employment arrangements in Australia back to pre-Wilberforce days.

I face the same frustration as prompted the member for Mallee to ask his question of the minister, that is, the frustration of having crops ripe to be picked, quality crops waiting to be delivered, being unable to find the staff or, what is even more frustrating, finding the staff but finding them unwilling to work. That is at the nub of this concern. It is something we cannot escape.

        Members opposite may suggest that this would be addressed if salary levels were raised or if work situations were improved. Part of the focus of the motion I have put to the House calls on the government to look to ways in which there may be some training component. People may feel they are more part of a national industry as a result of that training component. But at the bottom line what neither government nor opposition can escape is that there are people in Australia able to work but unwilling to work. I do not have a nice comfortable solution to the problem, but I believe the House owes it to all of those who are looking for export opportunities, particularly in labour intensive industries, to find some way to encourage people to work.

        The tragedy that my Riverland growers face and that the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area growers in the electorate of the honourable member for Riverina face is that frankly it is not a bad sort of a vocation. I can find you people who spend their lives picking fruit and who regularly earn well in excess year round of $100 a day. In the citrus industry, for example, the harvest starts in May and does not finish until April the following year. The opportunities are there. Last week in my office we had a plea from one of the major citrus growers to intervene to ensure that an Indian family about to be deported could stay because they were among his best pickers. Each of those family members beyond school-going age, clearly here as illegal immigrants or about to exceed their visa status, was earning more than $100 a day because they were energetic and organised fruit pickers.

It is difficult to imagine a career path in fruit picking, but we need to develop a mentality in people that they are part of a developing export industry, that the fruit they pick is destined for an export market, that it therefore needs to be handled carefully and that they need to be energetic in their approach. If that happened I would have thought that, with some imagination, there would be opportunities to move people through not only a fruit picking chain but also a processing and packing chain so that they feel they are part of a total industry rather than simply being regimented in the relatively boring task of taking a product off a tree and putting it into a container.

        If honourable members look at those products that are most labour intensive, for example soft fruit products, exports of stone fruits from Australia have doubled over the last three years—something for which the government may claim some credit. The exports of citrus fruits from across Australia, particularly navel oranges, has also increased. In fact, the greatest potential for the sale of Australian navel oranges exists in, of all places, America.

On behalf of a number of employers, I am expressing the frustration they feel at having unemployment queues on one side of their gate and fruit to pick on the other.

        —I have very little trouble in accepting nearly everything the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) put forward. However, I doubt that the simple tightening of arrangements for the receipt of unemployment benefits would get the result he is after. The fruit and vegetable industry has experienced, over recent years, difficulty in obtaining sufficient harvest labour in certain areas, particularly during peak seasons. Many of the traditional workers, such as students, backpackers, migrants and itinerant workers, et cetera, no longer seem to be attracted, as they have been in the past, to this industry.

        Several problems can be seen to be associated with this lack of enthusiasm for seasonal work. Harvest work requires workers to move from region to region and from farm to farm as one crop finishes and another starts. In my electorate of Page there is a range of horticultural industries, including macadamia, avocado and banana growers, market gardeners, and citrus and stone fruit orchards. In all cases, the period of work differs for different crops.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        One of the major difficulties for employees to keep working within the industry is a lack of transport to move from farm to farm. As most of the growers are situated out of town, that lack of transport, both public and private, makes it difficult for people to get to those farms and to work in the fruit and vegetable industry. Another problem facing the harvest labourers is that many of them are women who live and have families in the area. They are generally working to supplement the family wage, and most of these workers also do not have reliable access to transport facilities.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Another problem within the industry is that traditional harvest labour has remained generally unskilled. Little training has been undertaken by the industry to increase skill levels or to multiskill its work force. For example, in my electorate of Page a variety of seasonal crops is grown. Each crop has its own requirements and associated knowledge is needed to effectively maintain the crop so yields of good quality fruit are produced. Separate skills are required to harvest the fruit. Workers should and must have a well-rounded knowledge of different fruit requirements if they are to continue to work the year round as one crop starts and another finishes.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        It also stands to reason that the more skilled the work force becomes the more likely it is that short-term jobs will be converted to longer term ones for local job seekers, particularly the long-term unemployed. If a worker has not only the training to be able to harvest the fruit but also the maintenance techniques required during the growing season—such as pest control, pruning and irrigation—more jobs will present themselves for longer periods, giving a greater stability to the work force and greater prosperity for the region.

        I acknowledge the work the Department of Employment, Education and Training has done in terms of adopting innovative approaches to the use of labour market programs, which provide a readily accessible and skilled work force to local growers and retain the earned income within the community. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has made considerable steps in the area of adopting measures that will ensure a skilled work force is retained within the community. Some of those programs are the group employment programs, the regional employment assistance scheme and the mobility assistance scheme.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        These program strategies include skilling a reliable work force to meet the demands for seasonal labour and a program to assist long-term unemployed clients to learn the latest grafting techniques. This is an obvious area where jobs can be created. Most growers, and particularly orchards, in my electorate not only grow and harvest crops but propagate their own plants and graft what they have found to be successful varieties of fruit for their own crops. Seasonal work in grafting and propagation is available six to eight months each year. Another strategy is aimed at an integrated approach that provides casual workers with specific skill training followed by a period of seasonal work and then a period of further skill training prior to another round of on-the-job training.

        However, these strategies are only one answer to the problem experienced by growers having increased difficulty in attracting sufficient workers during peak season. We need to identify the major issues within the industry and adopt a series of reforms and initiatives that will strengthen the industry and attract workers to it. It is a problem that the Department of Employment, Education and Training cannot tackle simply by itself. Indeed, if it could, that would not ultimately be of benefit to the industry, for change must come from within the industry and the community as well as the DEET initiatives.

        In February 1994 I released a report of the horticultural task force to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins. That report found that exports of horticultural products are decreasing in Australia in relative terms to Southern Hemisphere competitors. The findings point to a need to concentrate on our ability to compete on international markets and regain our domestic share as well to be able to compete in an import replacement industry, especially in the realm of processed products. Also, the report called upon the horticultural industry to change from one that is essentially fragmented in nature to a more modern, dynamic industry to actively respond to challenges and capitalise on the strengths of the industry to meet growing international demand and increase market opportunities as a result of GATT related changes.

The major destinations of those products would be north-east and south-east Asia and the Pacific nations. The gross value of product will have to increase to approximately $5 billion by the year 2000 to service increased domestic consumption and potential export demands. Therefore, changes must come from within the industry to meet those demands and challenges.

        There is a major need for the industry to be allowed not only the flexibility but also the incentives to effect change that will see greater productivity and prosperity for the grower and to encourage workers to seek work in a more productive and sustainable industry. There is a need for long-term strategies to be developed that can readily adopt the changes identified. The horticultural industry has identified the need for consistent quality, value adding and innovative presentation of fresh and processed products. If these challenges are met, greater job opportunities will arise as profitability increases.

        The avenue of value adding to the fruit and vegetable industry is one which is yet to be adequately explored. Certainly, table fruit receives a higher market price than fruit for juicing or canning. But, with the demand of convenience food rising, it is likely that Australian horticultural growers will have new opportunities to add value to their products and take advantage of new markets. This responsibility does not lie with the Department of Employment, Education and Training but rather with a whole range of government bodies such as the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, particularly in its agribusiness funding program, as well as the industry itself and the community.

        Value adding is certainly an avenue that provides employment opportunities as the industry expands to meet growing demands. Take the example of one stone fruit orchard in my electorate of Page. Not only does the orchard provide quality table fruit but it also has invested in the machinery which allows it to produce its own dried fruit, which is sold locally. That extra work the orchard has created itself has provided greater productivity for the growers as well as increased employment opportunities for the workers.

        Research and development are also critical for growers to choose new varieties that are more suitable for their own particular area—those that are more disease resistant and produce better quality and greater produce. It is important that the industry be given the means to continue this research as greater productivity for the industry will logically flow on to more jobs in the community.

        Changes have been implemented by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to encourage workers, particularly the long-term unemployed, to areas in the fruit and vegetable industry that are experiencing shortages at peak season. I do not support the move to tighten conditions any further on receipt of unemployment benefits, further than they are currently. These changes would enable those suffering from the shortages to overcome that problem.

        One of the primary problems associated with much of the industry is the method of payment. In Page, for example, most stone fruit growers pay an hourly rate.

Unless some method is found to overcome the difficulty of providing labour to harvest the nation's crops, food growing areas, particularly horticultural areas, will suffer great economic damage as will the national economy.

        Once itinerant professional pickers travelled from North Queensland, down through northern New South Wales, through the Riverina into Victoria and South Australia picking the crops as they went. For a number of reasons, these days have gone. The first reason is that the growth of the horticultural industries in Queensland which occupy the few remaining full-time pickers for at least six months of the year where they can be in a reasonably pleasant climate and close to the coast. The second reason is that the cost of travelling has increased dramatically. In addition, people are no longer willing to put up with a lack of accommodation, or even poor accommodation, that they once would have accepted.

        However, it has to be admitted that, in close proximity to the MIA, the Wagga Wagga district of the CES had nearly 4,000 registered unemployed on its books during the last picking season while the Griffith district had, at the same time, well over 2,000 registered. There is no doubt that picking some crops, particularly in summer, can be hard work and in some cases unpleasant. However, there are many people employed permanently in similar circumstances who are prepared to do this work. It may be asked: if some are prepared to do the work, why should others on unemployment benefits not be asked to do the same?

When people are totally unsuitable, it is better for both them and the employer that they do not turn up for the job.

        Today many growers are relying on backpackers from overseas to pick their crops, many of whom do not have work permits but without whom the crop would not be picked. I have received a number of representations over the years from both prospective employers and employees, and some things have become clear. The first is that when would-be pickers come to horticultural areas there is generally a lack of suitable accommodation and facilities. Many growers have good on-farm accommodation and, according to anecdotal stories, they have little trouble attracting pickers. But other employers, some with accommodation, often strike a problem in finding workers.

        Another problem is transport. While many people can get to an area using public transport, they often find themselves isolated and not able to travel to the work site. Some of these work sites may be 30 kilometres from the town; they may be without toilet facilities; and, being flippant, in some cases they may not even have a tree in sight. With present unemployment benefits readily available, some people will no longer put up with these conditions.

        Another shortcoming is the lack of training given to newcomers to the various horticultural industries. While a skilled worker may be able to make a living from picking, newcomers find it very difficult. From the growers' point of view, there is a problem of non-reliability of the work force, and we see many letters in the local papers complaining of that. But we also find from community and charitable organisations complaints about the lack of accommodation and transport facilities.

        There is also the problem that arises when pickers refuse to work unless payment is in cash and no tax is taken from the pay. Often the employers pay the tax as well as the wage. In many instances, false tax file numbers are given and many imaginative pseudonyms are used as names. Apart from asking for a tax file number, the employer is not permitted to ask for any other identification. The compulsory superannuation payment then becomes a difficulty, with the payments going straight into consolidated revenue.

Therefore, local government should assist where it can to provide suitable facilities for those pickers.

The first problem is the way in which the activity test is applied by the Commonwealth Employment Service in directing job seekers to seasonal work.

        I have been assured that every job seeker registered with the CES in the Huon Valley who is suitable for seasonal work is employed. For me, this is heartening in terms of the outcomes for the Huon Valley, but it does raise questions about the way in which the activity test is applied in other regions around Australia. This activity test is the key to ensuring that those people registered as job seekers with the CES have an imposition upon them to accept work. From the anecdotal evidence provided in this place, and from around Australia, there is a strong indication that the activity test is not applied with the strength necessary to ensure that job seekers accept available work. This problem needs to be investigated thoroughly and a report on the findings returned to parliament.

        The second problem that is critical to the whole issue is the need to formally link the CES, employers and state taxation departments during periods of seasonal work. As I mentioned previously, the CES in the Huon Valley only deals with between 15 and 20 per cent of the work force. I would suspect that this is the case across the nation. This situation means that the great majority of seasonal workers are not known as a group, not managed effectively as a work force, not formally linked to employers and not available to work around the country. There is no doubt that through the informal way that this important work force is ineffectively and inefficiently managed many of these workers are not declaring their incomes.

        With respect to seasonal work and employment arrangements, we have a serious management problem. I believe that to properly address this problem we must first identify the work force. To do this, there needs to be a requirement for employers to contact their local CES and inform the office of the details of their employment arrangements. This arrangement would begin the process of identifying the seasonal work force. The CES should in turn contact the state taxation offices and advise them of the details of all seasonal work employees. This would ensure that their incomes are declared.

        I have said in a few words what in fact will require an intensive and detailed investigation of establishing a management system for seasonal workers, one which effectively utilises an available work force of job seekers and itinerant workers and one which leads to legitimate revenue raising through declared income. I commend this motion to the House.

        —I support the motion  moved by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I come from a large fruit and vegetable growing electorate. I have three large fruit and vegetable growing areas in my electorate: the Bundaberg-Gin Gin-Childers area, which is on the coast; the North Burnett area, which has a big citrus industry; and the Yarwun-Targinnie area, which is near Gladstone.

        One of the big problems is that Bundaberg has now reached the stage where it is rivalling Bowen as the largest tomato growing area in Australia. It is already the largest zucchini growing area. On top of that, 30 other crops are grown in the area. It is a subtropical area and because of the subtropical nature of the district, it means that heat and humidity play a big part in the maturing of the crops. That means that small crops and fruit crops often have to be picked at very short notice.

        That in turn means that they need a very responsive and well organised work force. That has certainly developed in that area, but sadly not by using Australians who are out of work. The May quarterly figures for the Wide Bay area of my electorate show that 13.7 per cent of people are out of work and 40.8 per cent of the teenage work force is out of work. That is a tragedy.

        In order to cope with this problem, a number of the backpacker lodges have developed efficient transfers to the farms for people seeking work. In Bundaberg and Childers alone there are 310 places at four lodges. When you add to that the accommodation available at caravan parks, they can cater for some 400 people. These people are taken in minibuses to the farms. That means that they arrive on time, they do a good day's work, they leave on time and are transported back to the backpacker lodges. They are back again the next morning at the required time of 7.00 or 7.30 to get into the crop. Those people are very popular with the farmers and they are a very reliable source of work. What we are doing is virtually exporting Australian jobs to overseas backpackers. That matter needs to be addressed in some detail.

         —I wish to continue speaking on the matter of employment in the small crop industry and, in the 90 seconds available to me, I would like to suggest a number of ways we can get over the problem that we have. Firstly, officers of the CES should make provision for fleets of minibuses to be available, either on a seasonal or a rotational regional basis, to take unemployed people to farms. If this can be done by backpacker lodges, with 10 or 12 minibuses operating each day, it should be possible for a government department to do something similar.

         Secondly, this could perhaps be developed on a circuit basis—a whole series of crops could be harvested in rotation. Thirdly, more flexible averaging arrangements for those moving in and out of fruit picking should be made and unemployment benefits should be arranged accordingly. Fourthly, as suggested by the Bundaberg and District Fruit and Vegetable Growers, a training video or film to take some of the terror and misunderstandings out of the fruit and vegetable industry should be considered.

         —I would like to explain to the House how this government is ripping off former university students. Under legislation passed last year, repayments of HECS debts through tax instalments became mandatory from July 1994. It was done this way to make it easier to clear debts in regular instalments through the PAYE system than as one lump sum each year.

         Where the system is unfair is that the government does not credit the repayments until the end of each financial year, yet on 1 June each year the Australian Taxation Office indexes debts to make them reflect the increase in the cost of living. The problem with this is that the indexation is applied to the previous year's balance, ignoring the repayments that have been made over the year via PAYE instalments.

         For example, one constituent at 1 June last year owed $4,878. He paid $1,391 for the 1993-94 year, leaving a balance of $3,487. On 1 June this year, the government applied indexation of 2.5 per cent to the figure, despite it going down each fortnight since July last year. Clearly, the indexation should be applied to a much lower figure.

         —There is one thing that Australian farmers will willingly tell you: Labor's concern and treatment of farmers have been consistent—consistently cynical, consistently uncaring and consistently out of touch. The most recent example that has come to my attention is the question of the diesel fuel rebate. The government went to a lot of trouble to try to convince us that farmers would not be affected by the alterations to the diesel fuel rebate that are now before the Senate. In fact, when we look at the small print, we find that farmers will be affected.

         Limestone mining will also be affected. As anyone will tell you, lime plays a very important part in looking after the soil in many parts of Australia. What the government is proposing to do will add up to $1.50 per tonne to the cost of lime, which equates to a 10 to 15 per cent increase in the price of lime. Lime has to be used in fairly large quantities when converting acid soil to a more neutral soil. In Victoria alone, this could cost anywhere between $200,000 and $300,000, and the figures from other states will add to that. This shows very clearly that we have a consistently cynical, consistently uncaring and consistently out of touch government.

The member for Stirling seems to think that, for some reason, the government should be ashamed of its policy of encouraging young Australians, after they leave school, to attend university. Let us face it: currently there are 600,000 Australian young people at our universities. I would like all the people of Australia to know of the very positive policy that this government has of encouraging such people, of making it possible for such people to attend university. I can tell those opposite that we are not at all ashamed of asking for a HECS contribution once those people have finished at university and are participating in the work force, because that means that more Australians will be able to attend university.

         This tradition goes back to the Whitlam government. Up until then, under a long history of coalition governments starting from the Second World War, it was virtually impossible for the children of working families to attend universities because the government gave them no assistance at all. Then, when the Whitlam government came to power, it made certain that the children of working class families had the same opportunity as those of the wealthy. That tradition continues, with the result that we have seen enormous growth in tertiary education.

         —Last Wednesday I questioned the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) about the contaminated land at the Islington Railyard in my electorate. The residents' spokesperson has already made public her concerns about the inadequacy of the minister's answer, and I would like to challenge him over his claims that the problem at Islington is a problem entirely of South Australia's making. I challenge this statement for two important reasons. The first is that in the railway agreement of 1975 the Commonwealth took over from the state authorities. The agreement in part states:

       <para>
        The second reason I challenge the statement is that the minister has not been entirely truthful in this matter. Ministers not being entirely truthful is something that, sadly, gives all politicians a bad name. The problem was not just the making of the South Australian authorities, and there is proof of this. In 1985, 10 years after Australian National took over the railways from South Australia, the Waste Management Commission wrote to both Australian National and the federal environment department in the following terms:

          —My remarks follow closely on the remarks just made by my colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). Harry referred to a statement that had been issued by Senator Ian Macdonald, a spokesman for the opposition, in which he drew attention to the possibility that the opposition could announce what he referred to as visionary statements while making sure that they retained the flexibility that would ensure the coalition would not have to make any commitment to any of them. That indicates a lack of political principle on the part of the opposition.

          Let us see if there have been any other examples of this. A senior Liberal is quoted as having said that the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to have a people's convention in relation to the republic is designed to simply bury the issue.

          That is not only happening with members of the opposition themselves; it is also occurring with the Leader of the Opposition. When he answered to a doorstop interview after Senator Gareth Evans had earlier indicated the government's initial response to the proposal by France to resume those nuclear tests, he said that the government's response was appropriate. As soon as he got a whiff of the community's response to those  nuclear tests, there was a sudden change in attitude. Then Senator Evans was just `tickling their tummy'.

         It is very clear that our attitude to the French has been very poor. The government did take a very weak stance on this issue in the very early stages. In fact, the opposition moved some amendments to provide a little bit of strength. What did we see from the government? It was quite happy to sit back on its laurels and not accept that. But what are we seeing now?  We are seeing a little bit of movement to those areas—a little bit of support for some of the things that were really the initiatives of the opposition.

         When the honourable member wants to get up in this place and talk about what his government is doing and the way it has been standing up and supporting these issues, I suggest he has a little bit of a look at the history—not the too distant history, but the recent history—of this issue. I think the stance the opposition has taken—particularly the stance of the Leader of the Opposition—on this issue is totally appropriate. If this government had any courage, it would have actually stood behind the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition rather than wait until some time later.

         I do not know how many former ministers there are left on the other side of the House but those who are there will know that routinely, certainly under this government and I am sure under the former government, departments enter cabinet coordination comments which are not necessarily the views of ministers.

I have made it clear that they can, if they wish, put a view, but it is not necessarily my view. That is the weight with which all ministers regard these things.

This story is written as though this was the cabinet decision. It was not the action the government took.

         I do not know whether we are having an unreality debate in this community—whether an opposition leader can go around promoting this kind of vandalism in the Senate. There is a lot of debate now about what the Democrats will do. The Democrats have got eight votes over there. It is what the coalition will do that matters. What matters here is that the member for Bennelong, having visited that particular poison well in 1975, in the refusal of supply and that which came with it, is now going back to this issue in using the Senate to knock over these measures.

It is just rank and putrid opportunism, just as it was in 1975 by the then unprincipled opposition. So let members in this House understand and let the public understand that the Leader of the Opposition is again back visiting the scene of the crime, in this case the 1975 crime, trying to knock over the legitimate money policies of the government in the lower house. And for what? At the same time his deputy is out telling us we need to tighten fiscal policy, calling for the government to tighten fiscal policy. Next time they do their doorstops saying there ought to be a tighter fiscal policy, someone at least should say to them: how can you put that sort of hypocrisy when you have opposed these measures in the Senate?

One is monetary policy, one is fiscal policy and the other is wages policy through the Accord, with some weight on each arm rather than undue weight on any one arm through high interest rates, by a massive cut in the social wage through cuts in government spending, and/or a massive reduction in real wages. What we have is a little weight on all. In fact, as a consequence of low inflation we have seen in the last few years substantial improvements in real wages and disposable incomes through lower interest rates.

         That is the environment. When the Minister for Finance talks about a change, we are not talking about $100 million here; we are talking about $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion. We are talking about half a per cent of GDP. GDP this year is running at $500 billion; $2.5 billion is half a per cent of GDP. That is a very large change of magnitude. That will have an impact on the sentiment in markets. It is that which the Minister for Finance referred to. At any one time the sentiment in markets cannot be related to a particular nominal interest rate but when there is a market sentiment for a change in the underlying fiscal balance of the country and the government has provided for it, for that to change and for that to be arrogantly and politically put asunder for no reason but basically vandalism and villainy, that changes sentiment.

         You could not trust him with a jam jar full of 5c pieces—that is the truth of it—because this person is prepared to put asunder the government's budget which is needed to get the economy, the budget, back into surplus so as to remove absolutely the call on national savings by the public sector, which it does. Let me make clear to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that both of the statements made by the Minister for Finance are entirely appropriate in the context in which they were put.

If he does not understand, he should not get into the business of vandalism; he should not get into lighting fires he cannot put out. If rates do not fall and markets take a set against cash rates or 90-day bills or any of these indicators, the responsibility for that will be with the opposition.

         —I have just said some things about the budget outcome, the impact upon savings, the current account deficit, market sentiment and interest rates. I also said a couple of things about the prerogatives of the Senate. But let me make this point clear again. The Senate has had traditionally a role of reviewing these measures—of looking through them and seeing how they apply—and consequential amendments have come from them. When a Senate decides that it will either refuse supply or get into the business of a massive change to the budget balance—in this case of $2.5 billion in the out year—it is overplaying its hand.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Weekend Australian
         </emphasis>
         by Sir Garfield Barwick about Sir Robert Menzies. The article refers to when Barwick first learned of this issue. It states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Menzies took a message from Fraser, saying just "we are acting". Barwick writes that he instantly understood what was meant and that Menzies was angered by it, saying: "The young fools are impatient. If they give this fellow (Whitlam) enough rope, he'll hang himself."
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Asked by Menzies what he would do, Barwick replied that in the right circumstances, "I would not be troubled by a refusal of Supply by the Senate."
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        The arrogance of it—he `would not be troubled'. The article continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Menzies disagreed, probably because he did not believe it proper to refuse Supply, Barwick says. But he thinks Fraser was right to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here he is saying that the Prime Minister of 16 years standing—who had, I believe, always a quite clear understanding about the prerogatives of the two chambers—was angered by a refusal of supply and thought it improper. But of course we heard over the weekend that Sir Garfield Barwick has expatiated in his book that he thought it was appropriate. That is the sort of immorality of action that now runs in the minds of the current opposition.

         It has obviously been playing on Sir Garfield's conscience, like it played on Sir John Kerr's conscience and Malcolm Fraser's conscience. When the Leader of the Opposition said that it illegitimised us—I quote what he said a week ago in this parliament—in fact it did and did play on the conscience of those people, as it is playing on Sir Garfield Barwick's now.

         I say as an aside that the one person who has kept his dignity since 1975—there is no problem with the conscience of the victim of all this—is Gough Whitlam. History has judged him as being a much bigger person than it has judged Sir Garfield Barwick, John Kerr or Malcolm Fraser to be.

         I come to the core of the matter—this is the same attitude taken by today's opposition. Sir Garfield stated:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        What a lot of hoo-ha there was about something which, if you know the facts—and the situation is the government has been refused Supply and the government has no money—what is wrong with getting rid of the government?
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the first point. Then he goes on to say, and it is the same attitude which prevails today:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the Whitlam ministry was "toughing it out" . . .

        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, it was dishonourable for the government of the day to seek to get its budget through and to pressure the Senate but it was completely honourable for the Senate to do that which Sir Robert Menzies said was improper. This is the sort of view put about, and it is still around now, by the tyrants of the Liberal Party—the unprincipled rogues of the Liberal Party gallery, who today still talk about refusing $2 1/2 billion worth of budget measures. The article had a few other revealing things that I think are worthy of attention.

         —When asked about the obligation to warn the ministry of any action, Sir Garfield said, `First of all this is a power or ability, not an obligation.' In other words, it is not an obligation to go telling the Prime Minister of the day that somebody will dismiss him. Then he went on to talk about Bagehot's expression. He said for the government to have been warned `would clearly have worn the aspect of a threat'. The article continues:

        In other words, if the Governor-General were to have been frank with his Prime Minister, it would have been a warning and a threat. The same immoral sentiment expressed by this conscience-ridden former Chief Justice is the exact sentiment being expressed by the coalition today. It is the very same sentiment that leads members opposite to believe that they can refuse $2 1/2 billion worth of budget measures, and yet they cynically walk to the front door of Parliament House and say in a doorstop, `The government should tighten its budget.' It is the same unprincipled, hypocritical action.

         What has been revealed by this is that the coalition, in 20 years, has come nowhere. You would think that at least the person who described them as illegitimised—that is, the member for Bennelong—would at least show the leadership needed to repair the immorality of their position. Instead of that, he compounds it by being the same opportunist that every Liberal before him was. That is why he should stand condemned for what he is seeking to do in the Senate to the government's budget.

        . . . we say that we have a right, as an opposition, to oppose tax measures.

We are not suggesting a blockage of the Appropriation Bills and therefore putting the Government in jeopardy. All that we are saying is that there ought to be a blockage of these tax Bills because they are not in the best interest of this country. It is consistent with the fact that we have opposed various tax Bills in the past.

Has the Prime Minister forgotten that the double dissolution of 1983 was obtained, in part, on the refusal of the opposition in the Senate to pass some sales tax measures?

         —I saw a comment earlier this morning attributed to Senator Hill. When someone finally from the media draw attention to a slight inconsistency in the coalition's approach of calling for a budget surplus and at the same time opposing, as the Prime Minister has said, some billions of dollars worth on the revenue side, he said:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We said that they should reduce expenditure significantly.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was Senator Hill's response. In addition to that, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speak in those terms. When, from time to time, I have had occasion to stand up in this place and say that the opposition supports nothing in reducing what was then a budget deficit and putting it into surplus—they do not support revenue measures and they do not support outlays measures—I said that they support neither of those. The Leader of the Opposition said in this place in a personal explanation:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        He is absolutely incorrect. We will take a stand against taxes, but we will support spending cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        They have thus far been invited to attend one spending cut. I remind the House that, in gross terms, there is some $1 1/2 billion worth of spending cuts in this budget. They have had their first test. They have only had one test on that. Tests will come down the line because all those propositions will come before the House as the year goes by. The first one of their tests is that in the out years is a saving of some $70 million—over $150 million through to that out year and growing exponentially after that. That was a decision by the government to put in place a limitation on access to non-work related child care, to occasional care.

         We put in place a child-care system that this country can be proud of. It has gone from something like an expenditure when they were in office of $60 million a year to close to $1 billion now—from 40,000 places then to 240,000 places now. What we have said is we have a target, particularly related to work related child care, of taking that through to 350,000 by the end of the decade.

         Let me go through what is meant by this non-work related child care. It does not relate to a family who find themselves in a situation where they have a non-working partner and nevertheless are at risk because that non-working partner is ill or because that non-working partner has decided to go into training because that non-working partner wants to enter the work force. It does not relate to a family where that non-working partner is in a family situation which is a highly risky one because there is child abuse or whatever involved in the family. It does not apply to any of those criteria. People in those situations get access to full child care.

It may be for doing a whole raft of totally acceptable and necessary public activities. We say they should get 12 hours worth of that subsidised by the government. We should not get into a situation where we are effectively providing preschools—inadequately staffed, inadequately organised preschools—and cost shifting from the states to the public sector.

         In case you do not understand this, when you go through the process of making budget changes and putting in place budget cuts, you have to take decisions. They have to be from time to time reasonably tough decisions. This is not a particularly tough decision, but it has very material consequences for the provision of child care in this community—very material consequences if you are going to hit that target of 350,000. Because there is not the incentive to provide work related child care, there is not the incentive to run child care places which offer the full range of hours that ought to be available to working parents, there is not the incentive to build them in the areas where there is real need, where the kids need to be looked after, we are putting in place a set of incentives that will produce that situation.

         The first hurdle on a cut and the opposition falls at it. So do not wander around in this place saying that you will resist all the tax changes, that you will resist any tax increases, but you will support some spending cuts. You have only been tested once on that and so far you have failed. You have failed monumentally because you have accompanied your failure with a promise which is now an undertaking—that you will not only not support the government's position but support 50 hours worth of non-work related child care. What are you going to do with the kids—put them in a kibbutz? This is an extraordinary promise—50 hours worth of non-work related child care.

         Do you know how much that costs—$1 1/2 billion? This is not me saying it; this is a Finance calculated cost on your proposition—$1 1/2 billion. That goes on top of Senator Ian Macdonald's statement last week, which the Prime Minister referred to, about what he was going to do in that little sleight of hand exercise. He nevertheless did choose to put a bit of a cost on the infrastructure projects. He said:

         If it gets into the out year, it will get to $70 million. You have to put in place measures which provide an incentive to ensure that child care goes into the places where it is needed. You have to ensure that the states accept their proper responsibility to provide preschools. You certainly have to maintain, as the government maintains, that people who are not in the work force should nevertheless be able to get a decent shake at child care if they are at risk—a totally unfettered shake at child care, which is the government's position. But if they are not at risk and they are using occasional child care instead for totally reasonable purposes like they want to go shopping, play sport or get involved in voluntary activities—all the sorts of things that non working spouses do—yes, we say they should be allowed to do that, but 12 hours a week is entirely reasonable for subsidised care, as far as that is concerned.

You wander around the place saying, `I'm the boy who wants to make quality cuts. I know about quality cuts.' You have had your first real cut to come up with and you have fallen over. Not only have you fallen over on that, you have allowed him to make an absurd promise of 50 hours of child care for people who are not seeking work related child care, costing—Finance costing—$1 1/2 billion on top of the $1 billion that Senator Ian Macdonald promised.

         We have seen a quite dramatic change to the level of interest rates, nominal and real, and to the underlying inflation rate. Let me just record the point that, since 1991, the average inflation rate has been 1.9 per cent. If you go back over the Labor years to 1983, the average rate of inflation was 5.5 per cent, but under John Howard the average rate was 9.7 per cent.

         —The hardest thing to deliver in this country by a long measure has been low inflation. Low inflation is the core matter in Australia's competitiveness. It is the core matter in the exchange rate, in wages and in the current account deficit in terms of our competitiveness, our capacity to export more goods and services, to import and to compete. None of these things can succeed without a low inflation rate.

         The people over there say that they can manage money, but what they established in the 1970s and early 1980s was that they could not manage double digit inflation. They did not know what to do about it. They could not manage wages and they could not manage inflation. But the main problem with the current account was a fall in domestic savings occasioned by a decade and a half of double digit inflation, and most of that period was presided over by the current Leader of the Opposition, who had the opportunity to deal a mortal blow to inflation but who never had the policies, the courage or the wit to be able to do it.

         That is why the current account was six per cent of GDP in 1980-81, leaving that current account exposure there. The only way out of it is, basically, a change in the savings performance and capacity of the country. That will only come from a slow change to the propensity to save, with the changed inflation performance. It will come, most obviously, with the budget coming back into surplus—that is, the public sector saving and not dis-saving—and by a set of arrangements where we have contributions to savings by superannuation. They are the very things that the opposition wants to upset.

That is a very important statement to be able to make—that the whole of the public sector of Australia is not calling on any private savings and that, therefore, the funding of the current account deficit is done by people who then look at the underlying competitiveness of the country.

         —Honourable members would be well aware that the government announced in the budget the introduction of the new maternity allowance. It will be coming into effect from February 1996. The allowance is equal to six weeks of the parenting allowance, which at current rates of payment is around $816. In the current round of Accord negotiations the government has undertaken to review that in future with a view to improvement as budgetary circumstances permit.

         There have been a few unwarranted criticisms. Some have criticised the payment on the basis that it is paid to women outside the work force. On the contrary, we see that as a strength of the payment in that it goes well beyond the requirements of the ILO convention and recognises the reality of the modern labour market, and that is that people enter and exit the labour market all the time and therefore it would be illogical to restrict the provision only to those women who are most recently in jobs. Other criticisms have come from the opposition. The honourable member for Berowra said the allowance was not enough, thereby implying that the opposition might do a bit more, but the Leader of the Opposition, aka the battler's friend, said he thought it was a good thing but he accused us of engaging in copycat politics. That is what he said: copycat politics. I wonder who it was he was implying that we had been copying. Had he perchance been suggesting we had been copying the opposition? Have we been doing that? It is interesting to go back to the 1978 budget speech of the Leader of the Opposition. On that occasion—

         —In 1978 one of the measures that the now Leader of the Opposition and then Treasurer undertook, in what was one of the most vicious budgets in the entire post-war period from the point of view of battlers, was to abolish a small maternity allowance which had been introduced in the first instance under the Fisher Labor government in 1912. This was an allowance of about $30, which he abolished. Justifying that abolition, in his 1978 speech he said:

        It is interesting that he brings those two things up. In terms of health care arrangements what did he do then? He slashed the Medicare coverage to 40 per cent of the schedule fee. That was what he did for battlers on that occasion in terms of health care. What about family allowance? All he did there was a revenue neutral substitution of the family allowance for the old child tax rebate. It was a revenue neutral measure. All he did on that occasion was subtract from benefits to families. That is a total contrast with everything we have done for families.

         Every time we have introduced a measure it has been a major enhancement, an increase, in the real level of assistance for families. He would not pay that measly $30 maternity allowance. We will be paying a maternity allowance currently set at $816, which is six weeks of parenting allowance. By the time it comes into effect, almost certainly we will be paying significantly more than that because there will be an indexation adjustment in September of the parenting allowance. Interestingly enough, in all probability, depending on how the June quarter CPI turns out, the increase in the maternity allowance that we will be paying as a result of that adjustment in September will exceed the total amount that this man was not prepared to pay families in 1978.

I was very pleased to have discussions with all the state ministers just two weeks ago in which we got agreement to ensure that there genuinely is universal health care through the Medicare agreements. It is not just about payments to doctors; it is about ensuring the proper level of funding for hospitals. I am sure that members will be aware that there has been an increasing proportion of expenditure coming from the Commonwealth. While that funding has been increasing, the state share has declined and the impact has been on waiting lists and public confidence—public confidence which we can ill afford to undermine, particularly given the position of the opposition so far as we can determine what it is.

         The health ministers have agreed to engage in bilateral negotiations with the Commonwealth. That will mean the line is drawn very firmly on future cost shifting and it will mean that there will be bonus funding for the states on performance. For the first time we will have agreed outcomes with the states, for instance on the level and quality of inpatient and outpatient services, benchmarks for elective surgery waiting times and performance levels for accident and emergency departments to stop them cost shifting, as happened catastrophically in New South Wales with the Port Macquarie hospital. It is now costing the new state government 30 per cent more to run that privatised hospital than for other public hospitals. It is 30 per cent more expensive. This is the so-called saving that was supposed to be due to privatisation.

         The states have realised, regardless of their political affiliation, that this is a game they do not want to be a part of anymore. We will now be able to enter into very substantial agreements with the states to reduce waiting times for patients, to make sure that care is patient focused, to enable one stop shopping instead of jumping around between various facilities and to enable a more rational and efficient hospital system. I make this point because Labor is clearly able to tackle the big issues and still deliver on major administrative and policy reform.

I believe that, by taking these sorts of approaches, we will see a higher proportion of women representatives in parliament. Because of the sort of chauvinism which exists within the coalition, such a change has not been possible. Coalition members knew of no way to increase female representation, so they slithered around the issue, explaining, `Don't worry; we will have more women.' I know they will not, and they know they will not.

         I would have thought the questioner would have understood that and saved herself the embarrassment of having to hear me say it—that is, the opposition will not have that. On this side, a very large part of the changed status of Australian women has been delivered by this government. The overwhelming part of the change in sentiment, that background in public policy which has changed the status of Australian women, has been delivered by this government. It has been true in big and major areas of policy and it has been true in parliamentary representation. As the end of the century moves closer, it will be more true.

         I am pleased to say that the security situation in Bougainville has improved towards a peaceful settlement. As that situation has improved, the focus of Australia's aid has likewise been changed to concentrate on the longer term rehabilitation of that troubled province. We have provided over $7 million to Bougainville since 1991, focusing on health, education and communication needs. That includes medical supplies, shelter, household equipment for those in care centres, textbooks, equipment to restore communications, water pumps, generators for five high schools and assistance for health services, restoration of educational programs and non-government organisation rehabilitation projects.

         To help the PNG government and the Bougainville Transition Government to consolidate the already significant move towards peace and to build confidence in the province, I announced today that I have decided to allocate a further $10 million for the Bougainville restoration program up to 1997. This assistance will be provided within our overall bilateral aid program to PNG and will concentrate again on health, education and infrastructure to enable people to resume normal life. Australia believes it would be a good thing if other donors were encouraged to contribute to the restoration efforts on Bougainville. That process will be assisted by the report of a UN mission which has recently been there.

We are doing our part. That capacity of Papua New Guinea to help will be assisted by its general economic recovery. That, in turn, will be helped by the anticipated successful conclusion of a package between the Papua New Guinean government, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

        —Before I call the honourable member for Goldstein, who wishes to make a personal explanation, I indicate that I have just been given advice which I think all members should be made aware of. I understand members have been either written directly to or, I am sure, lobbied by the nurses centre in respect of some difficulties that we are encountering there. I therefore inform honourable members that the Joint House Department is responsible for the provision of emergency first aid and other health care services through the nurses centre. An evaluation of the nurses centre was carried out by the Joint House Department in 1994. This evaluation followed advice received from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on the proper organisation of occupational health and safety within Parliament House.

        The Nursing Federation was consulted in regard to the terms of reference for the review, and the staff of the centre were involved in the process. The evaluation report indicated changes in the role of the nurses centre. Other changes, particularly the upgrading and relocating of OH&amp;S functions following legislative changes in 1991, have impacted on the responsibilities of that nurses centre.

        In April 1995 a copy of the report, together with the management response to the report, was provided to the Australian Nursing Federation. Discussions have been continuing with the Australian Nursing Federation, the most recent taking place last Friday, 23 June 1995. At that meeting, the Joint House Department representatives undertook to seek further information on the appropriate classification of the positions. The views of the Department of Industrial Relations have been sought and it has agreed with the classifications proposed. Further meetings will be held with that department in respect of this matter.

        At this stage, no action has been taken to change the classification of the positions. My latest advice, however, is that at 4.00 p.m. the nurses withdrew their services. Consideration is being given as to whether the Industrial Relations Commission should be notified of an industrial dispute. Can I say that, on behalf of both the President and me, every effort will be made to resolve this matter.

         —On Sunday, yesterday, there was a major protest in Melbourne over the proposed selling of Victoria's electricity, gas and water. Regrettably, the focus continues to be on the Kennett government as though the federal ALP is unequivocally opposed to the privatisation of public assets. It is as though the Victorian State Bank and a publicly owned Qantas and Commonwealth Bank never existed.

         What is also instructive is that ALP members of the Victorian parliament are jumping over each other in their quest to escape Kennett and take up a seat in the federal parliament. The three seats the refugees from the state parliament are chasing are Maribyrnong, Wills and Batman. Those who are chasing the seats are blokes, and they are all from the state party.

         Instead of facilitating a debate about the direction of the Labor Party, they want to engage in what they do best—that is, number crunch their way into a federal seat. It is disgraceful. It is one thing to run, join or try to co-opt a Public First campaign against Kennett; it is another to seriously address the obsession with privatisation which exists at both the federal and the state level. Perhaps the best thing the federal Labor Party has going for it in Victoria is Jeff Kennett. In fact, the existence of Jeff Kennett and the Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, provides a perfect camouflage for federal market-driven policies which include wholesale sell-offs of public assets.

         —I think you could do it a bit more to your mate from Werriwa. A large part of the pressure on state governments to sell assets derives from the federal government's continuing reduction in funding to the states. Since 1983 federal grants to the states have been regularly reduced. In 1983 Commonwealth grants were $9.5 billion per annum; in 1994-95 they fell to $7.2 billion.

         State privatisation is a consequence of reduced federal funding, and federal privatisation is a less than cunning attempt to improve the balance sheet in order to win an election. The federal government has the ability, under its Foreign Investment Review Board powers, to block the sale of Victoria's United Energy to a government owned French nuclear power company, but it is clear from the Prime Minister's answer to my question last week that it is the last thing he has in mind. It is one thing to proclaim a republic as being in the nation's genuine interest but it is another to use the FIRB regulations to stop a public asset being sold to a foreign enterprise. His answer last week would have given no solace to those genuinely opposed to the privatisation of public assets.

         When Kennett proposed the widening of the Tullamarine freeway and the application of a tollway, which in effect meant the further privatisation of transport, the state ALP vociferously registered its opposition and organised a local meeting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), spoke at the meeting and declared his and his government's opposition. It was said that an environmental impact statement would have to be acquired first and that this would probably stop the widening of the freeway.

         The ALP candidate for Wills will run around gladhanding constituents and telling them that unemployment has dropped to 8.6 per cent when the reality is that the north-west recorded a rise of 2.2 per cent between June 1994 and May 1995. All the self-proclaimed ALP duty senator for Wills, Kim Carr, will say publicly is that comparing statistics from one month to another does not provide an accurate account of trends. Fancy claiming that contrasting the increase in unemployment in the north-west with the decline of unemployment in Victoria does not take into account the trend!

         It gets worse. The duty senator defends the $1.2 billion cuts to the Working Nation package on the grounds that the program was delivering jobs more efficiently than before. The truth is the north and west of Melbourne have not been recipients of the so-called recovery. It is unquestionable that the Kennett regime, with its gambling, events led agenda, has harmed Victoria and the north and west of Melbourne. But to claim that the only villain is Kennett is, to use the Prime Minister's language, arrant nonsense. In the 1990s trade unions which seek wage increases are described as pursuing `aggressive money wage increases', and you can imagine who that came from.

         Telecom and Australia Post will obviously be in the firing line if the ALP is still in power and it sees the need to privatise in order to adjust the budget. If those who march against the sale of public utilities are not aware of the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank or do not see any danger for Telecom or Australia Post and the employment of Commonwealth public sector workers, then they are not looking carefully at the situation. If they believe that the dominant thinkers of the ALP are ideologically opposed to the sale of public assets, they are horribly wrong.

         What Working Nation represented was a real sea change in our whole attitude towards the process of assisting members of the community to gain the necessary skills and the opportunities to gain full-time employment. It put in place a comprehensive array of programs to subsidise the employment of those people who had been out of the work force for a great length of time and therefore needed work experience, exposure to new skills and the opportunity to learn new skills. It also represented a major change in our attitude towards young people.

         —I wish to address the topic of cogeneration. All members may not be familiar with this topic because, after all, it is not an issue that dominates question time. I will attempt to give honourable members my best technical definition. Cogeneration is the production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. A typical cogeneration plant comprises gas turbines or gas engines driving electric generators with a heat recovery system installed to recover thermal energy from exhaust gas or from water used to cool these engines. This thermal energy can then be supplied to nearby industrial or commercial users, such as commercial plants, food processing plants, paper mills and hospitals.

         Of course, there are many atypical cogeneration plants in existence now and planned for the future. Alternate fuel sources include biomass of all descriptions, such as wood waste, gas from rubbish dumps and almost any other energy producing source you can think of. Encouragingly, experience in other countries indicates potential for significant growth in cogeneration in Australia. At present, about three per cent of electricity consumption demand is met by cogeneration at some 70 sites around Australia.

         While a few industrial processes have used cogeneration for decades, these have been largely isolated instances. For these operations, the particular nature of the industrial process produced significant surplus energy which could be used to meet a demand for electricity on the same site. These opportunities did not constitute a cogeneration industry as they were rare and there was often no market for the surplus electricity.

         The issues of buyback rates, equitable access and incentives which confront us today were quite irrelevant then. But with the break-up of the market monopoly held by state utilities, the opportunity is open for generators of varying sizes and make-up to find a niche in the new national competitive electricity market. Increased energy efficiency demanded by unrelenting pressure on business input costs and our heightened awareness of environmental issue have also driven the development of cogeneration.

         These fundamental forces have ushered in a new era, where cogeneration at many small sites is a real possibility. For instance, a hospital running boilers to circulate hot water and steam may find it attractive to generate electricity from the waste heat. But at these small sites, the lack of economies of scale reduces the financial return from installing or modifying plant for cogeneration. For a viable industry, you need a fair return on these initial capital costs. The price of electricity generated from cogeneration must also be competitive in the new market. As a result of these conflicting financial pressures, the development of the cogeneration industry is poised somewhat delicately on a knife edge. A clear opportunity for cogenerators has opened up, but how far that opportunity can be pursued depends crucially on the pricing of the product.

         In remote and rural regions the situation is more favourable. Cogeneration should be very attractive in areas where the electricity grid does not reach as the competition will often be expensive diesel generators. Even where mains power is available in rural areas, high connection fees and tariffs will make cogeneration competitive in many situations. But in the cities and larger towns the demand for electricity is such that distributors of grid power will strenuously defend their share of the new competitive market. Economies of scale mean that they will be able to shave operating margins to ensure they retain market share.

         Gloomy as this sounds, it does not spell the end of cogeneration in urban locations as the principal benefits from cogeneration, such as energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction, are increasingly recognised by governments and by public policy commentators. But the question then is what other forces are shaping the development of cogeneration and how best to position the industry to maximise its evident potential. The most crucial force shaping cogeneration is the fundamental change occurring in the energy market in Australia, which would have been hard to imagine just a decade ago.

         Around Australia the dismantling of government utility structures and associated monopolies in the energy industries are well advanced. In the new market the ability to remain competitive by absorbing costs through efficiency improvements will be more crucial than ever in enhancing market share. The increased energy efficiency resulting from cogeneration will therefore be very attractive.

         The coalition believes that increased energy efficiency is a key element in reducing input costs for business, putting more flexibility in household budgets and minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The Commonwealth government Department of Primary Industries and Energy has estimated that there is a potential for Australia to save some $7 billion a year out of a total domestic energy bill of $35 billion. About 43 per cent of these savings are achievable from the more efficient use of electricity.

         A coalition government would improve energy efficiency by encouraging the use of energy efficient building construction and design, minimising airconditioning costs and encouraging the use of energy efficient plant and appliances. Such measures usually involve an initial capital cost, which can then be recouped through lower operating costs. Education of consumers in energy saving practices is also an important element of improved energy efficiency.

         In government, the coalition will target energy efficiency programs to address the areas of greatest need, including adopting energy efficient equipment by businesses and adopting a leading role through government procurement and operations. In government, the coalition will encourage the development of the cogeneration industry by removing impediments and encouraging the streamlining of approvals for the siting of cogeneration facilities, investigating incentive schemes to promote cogeneration and educating industry as to the benefits of cogeneration. In conclusion, the cogeneration industry is a very exciting industry to watch.

         —Some months ago in this House I drew attention to matters arising from the report prepared by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia called
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Hidden Cost of Fashion
         </emphasis>
         . In that report the union clearly outlined the outrageous circumstances now arising in Australia in the outreach industry where people work at home for what can be described only as slave wages and in slave conditions. In the report, the TCFUA estimated that there are now about 300,000 outworkers in the clothing industry—and that is a huge increase over the last five years. This has occurred as garment production in Australia has moved from the factory to the home, some argue in an effort to improve competitiveness against imports.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The report estimated that home based workers in the clothing industry outnumber factory based workers by about 14 to one. The effect of this is that there is little control over working conditions and pay rates, with numerous cases of exploitation and intimidation reported by outworkers, most of whom come from non-English-speaking backgrounds, particularly the Vietnamese and Chinese communities but also Turkish, Spanish, Cambodian and other ethnic groups.

         What concerns me most is that the outreach industry appears to be also subject to control by organised criminality. It is clear that the outreach industry is outside the control of any regulations in Australia. In my home state of Victoria, for example, there is no control any more on factory legislation and there is no control on labour inspection at all. In fact, under the Victorian department of labour, I do not think there are any inspectors of labour left. Hence no-one is going out into the community doing any checks on or controlling what is occurring in the outreach industry.

         After I made that speech, I received quite a bit of correspondence and phone calls from people. Some of the correspondents were very critical of me. Country Road was very critical of me and suggested that I was wrong to name Country Road as a company that was using products from the outreach industry. Ken Done's company also contacted me and was very critical. But a lot of people who know what is happening in the industry thanked me for that speech and have encouraged me to again raise these issues.

         For example, one gentleman from Yarraville in Melbourne rang me and said that from his window he was watching a house across the road which has a double carport. Around the double carport there was a bit of canvass and within the carport, which is open, were 24 sewing machines. He tells me that those sewing machines operate 24 hours a day and the people come in and out basically on shift work. At night-time they burn the lights. He mentioned how cold it is in winter sitting in an open garage with a bit of canvass around you. These places run 24 hours a day, in total contradiction of all labour acts and factory acts in this country. You would have thought we had come a long way from the Industrial Revolution and the sorts of conditions that 18th century England had but, from the way this gentleman described the place in Yarraville, it is very clear they still exist in this country.

          Weekend Australian

         of 15 and 16 April which refers to an investigation by the Australian Taxation Office. The report indicates that there is a rogue element in the textile industry and that it is getting very sophisticated in tax avoidance. The article points out that gone are the days when employers simply paid their low-skilled migrant workers in cash to avoid the tax man.

         The report says that the Australian Federal Police has uncovered a major cheque laundering scam in which suppliers and buyers collude to have legitimate payments made through third parties to avoid tax. The cash is used to pay subcontractors and outworkers in the outreach industry in the textile trade. The report indicates that, based on 1992 tax research, the Australian Taxation Office estimates that the clothing industry avoids about $100 million a year in pay-as-you-earn tax deductions and a further $70 million a year through undeclared profits and false deduction claims.

         But, as a report on the industry by the felt and textile union indicates, there is also massive Department of Social Security fraud, in that many of the outreach workers are instructed or forced to apply for unemployment benefits by the contractors who provide them with the work in order to get the contracts. In that way they can undercut the price they are offering the outreach worker. They also get the outreach worker in a criminal situation by defrauding DSS and avoiding tax. So they have the outreach worker locked into the contractor—a classic case of organised criminality known throughout most Western countries where these things happen as extortion.

         I have no doubt whatsoever that organised crime now controls the outreach industry in this country. I have no doubt whatsoever that Australian taxpayers are subsidising this outreach industry to well over $250 million a year. That is a massive scam in anyone's language; yet it seems to me that no-one is doing anything about it.

         My attention was drawn to this by people in the industry. I was invited to look at a factory on the north coast of New South Wales—a factory which had the latest technology in felt and textile production. It had computer systems for organising the flow rate of the garment production and it had the latest sewing machines. You name it, the factory had it. This factory closed putting 800 workers out of a job—800 people who were being paid according to award conditions; 800 people who were producing at a competitive price as against imports. This factory was competing successfully against imports from Asian countries, but it could not compete against the scams taking place in the garages and backyards of Australian outreach workers. That is what put this company out of business.

         I was reliably informed that this firm could produce a fashion garment for K-Mart or similar stores for $6. It could produce it for $6 complying with factory acts, workers compensation acts, award wages and treating its employees civilly. The firm was put out of business because the outreach industry was producing the same garment for $3. One has to ask: what is wrong in this country when a legitimate business employing people under decent industrial awards and treating them like civilised workers should be treated is put out of business by an industry which does not pay tax and which is subsidised by DSS? Why is this being allowed? It is time some state governments started employing factory inspectors again to go out into the streets of Melbourne in particular and Sydney to start investigating what is occurring in the outreach industry.

         Even further, I would like to see a major inquiry into the whole outreach industry. When there is clear evidence of tax avoidance of over $170 million a year and when there is clear evidence of massive fraud under the Department of Social Security, it is time that a major inquiry was instigated to examine this stinking, foul industry and to put it totally out of business. I will certainly be contacting ministers in this government and putting that proposition to them, and I will certainly be contacting state ministers asking them to start to intervene, so that legitimate business, genuine business, in Australia can compete not against imports but against the unfair competition of a subsidised racket which is occurring in Australia.

         —In the brief time left to me, I rise to speak about a number of matters pertaining to the recent history of the Western Australian Liberal Party and, in particular, the preselection for the seat of Moore and related items. The person who was illegally endorsed as the candidate for Moore for the Liberal Party in Western Australia the other day was quoted as saying that I became an Independent member to avoid some sort of kangaroo court inquiry that has been established by the Crichton-Browne, Cheryl Edwards faction or clique within the Moore division.

         This particular so-called `inquiry' is being put together as a means—a very poor means—of trying to discredit me. The following are amongst the grounds or terms of this inquiry. The first issue is the role of Dr Wayne Bradshaw in the 1987 Paul Filing campaign for the former seat of Cowan and the 1989 Brian Cooper campaign for the seat of Wanneroo. The elements of this particular inquiry obviously refer to Dr Wayne Bradshaw's involvement within the Liberal Party in the Moore division and, more substantially, his contacts and involvement with the city of Wanneroo—a matter that became the subject of quite an important inquiry, the Cahill report, which was conducted into the city of Wanneroo and published in 1992 in Perth. One of the problems that Mr Cahill found when he reported on this matter was that it was almost impossible to get any information out of Dr Bradshaw, who obviously was integral to the inquiry.

         It is in this way that this is related to the preselection for the seat of Moore. Some time ago last year—I think it was around August, September—I was at an annual general meeting of one of the branches in the division, the ocean reef branch, when Mr Smith approached me and said that he needed to speak to me about some of the problems which were going on in the Moore division. He wanted particularly to meet with me privately so that we could sit down and, allegedly, thrash out what was going on and sort it all out. I told him that I would not meet with him privately, but I agreed to meet with him with others present. Mr Smith then told me that he was under enormous pressure. He said that he had received a phone call from Senator Crichton-Browne saying to him that I, Paul Filing, was getting far too much influence in the branches in the Moore division—which is a strange thing for a federal member to be doing—and that he, Wayde Smith, ought to sort it out or he would get a kick in the backside.

         From that point onwards problems within the division accelerated and were exacerbated. They included the cooperation and participation of the State President of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Dr David Honey, whose role in this whole matter is quite extraordinary and, I must say, lamentable to the extent that Dr Honey circularised false minutes of the state executive of the party in a bid to try to discredit me. In fact, not only were these minutes false but the then State Director of the Liberal Party brought that matter to Dr Honey's attention at the time and told him that he ought not to circularise the minutes in their present format. Notwithstanding that particular advice from the state director, he went ahead and circularised them.

         In relation to this matter of the circularisation of the false minutes, my Queen's Counsel, who made a submission to the appeal—which appeal was upheld on the basis of grave irregularities in the preselection process; nonetheless, I had my preselection rejected by the Crichton-Browne nominated state council—made the following comments:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        There are grave reasons to be concerned with this, especially having regard to the matters set out in your Appeal Statement at pp. 16&amp;17. I was not previously aware of these matters and find it almost beyond comprehension that the State President could circulate minutes of a meeting of the State Executive notwithstanding that he had apparently been warned by the State Director that they were not a true record of the meeting and when they contained statements defamatory of you. In the event that you are interested in pursuing the matter, I would like the opportunity to investigate it further on your behalf and to advise you whether or not you have been seriously libelled by the President for, as you may be aware, to republish a libel published by another is in itself a libel . . .

       <para>
        That was only one of a gamut of matters relating to the Moore preselection and the behaviour of the state president and others on the state executive that attracted the ire of Queen's Counsel advising me on the appeal. It is quite clear that, from the moment following Mr Smith's conversation with me, I suddenly found the rug being pulled from underneath me and the extraordinary sequence of events that took place which led to my becoming an Independent member of this chamber.

         All I can say in conclusion is this: it is absolutely imperative that the Liberal Party in Western Australia be thoroughly reformed. At the next state conference there must be a thorough cleansing of the house so that not only a new president but a supportive state executive can move in and make the party more representative, more answerable and more relevant to the people it is supposed to represent.

When people come and sit in the galleries—sometimes they literally fill those galleries—they want to see an effective government performing and they want to see an effective opposition as well. I appeal to members on both sides of the chamber to go through

          —by leave—The Chairman of  the Procedure Committee, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), has basically outlined how it has come about that this discussion paper is being tabled today. I think it is noteworthy that the motive behind the drawing up of the discussion paper by him and me, and the tabling of it in this way, is to try to trigger a device whereby people do not have to feel defensive about their point of view, in the sense that we need to defend our position either as an opposition member or a government member.

All too often, virtually exclusively, when we debate procedures here, we talk in terms of what suits us, what has been the history of the House of Representatives and what it is that we as members of parliament expect from it.

          My final comment is that the secretary of the committee has drawn up a very good, basic discussion paper. I acknowledge the thorough work she has put into it, particularly in the appendices. That is not to discount the body of the paper; nevertheless, they are useful appendices. There is comment made in it about other parliaments. We should look at what happens in other parliaments if it helps us to improve ourselves. If it helps us to be even more complacent than we are at the moment, then I think we are viewing it through the wrong pair of spectacles. We should not aspire to be equal to the other parliaments of the world; we should aspire to be the best.

          Because of the need to change sites, the committee recommends that projects should not be referred to it until issues relating to site selection, including environmental clearances, have been obtained. Had this occurred prior to referral of the project to the committee, it would not have been necessary to change the location of the site, conduct two public hearings, as well as pay for the removal of the lizards from the site and their board with the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the committee was $114 million. However, as a result of concerns expressed by the committee, it is now proposed to construct the building for $105 million.

The proposed relocation of the Division of Minerals from Port Melbourne to the principal Victorian CSIRO site at Clayton is consistent with the long-term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. In effect, this particular proposal is the culmination of a 35-year program to transfer a group of compatible research divisions in Melbourne—the majority from one consolidated site at Fishermens Bend—to Clayton.

          The third report which I have tabled today relates to the proposed maintenance dredging of the Kedron Brook floodway to restore its original design capacity and the disposal of approximately 600,000 cubic metres of dredged spoil on part of the nearby old Brisbane airport site. The Kedron Brook floodway consists of an 8.5 kilometre long, deep water channel passing through approximately 500 hectares of flood plain linking the Kedron Brook with Moreton Bay.

          The floodway was designed to convey flood flows around the new Brisbane airport site. The estimated cost of the proposal is $9.1 million at March 1995 prices. The Kedron Brook floodway was constructed by the Commonwealth in 1980, as part of the new Brisbane airport development, to replace existing flood plain drainage systems which were filled during airport works. In designing the capacity of the floodway, the criterion adopted was that flood water levels outside Commonwealth land upstream of the floodway should not be increased as a result of airport construction.

          Since completion of construction, the deep channel of the floodway has been subject to gradual deposition of sediments over most of its length.

The transfer will be at no cost to the Brisbane City Council which will then be responsible for future dredging of the floodway. The land will be held in perpetuity as open space. The committee understands that the floodway and adjacent land will be incorporated into an expanded Boondall Wetlands Reserve. I commend the reports to the House.

         —In rising, I must admit that I had intended to make some comments in relation to the previous position taken by the government when this legislation first came through the House a week or two ago. The legislation has subsequently been into the Senate where amendments that were moved on behalf of the opposition by my colleague Senator Warwick Parer, and supported by the Australian Democrats, the Greens and I think Senator Brian Harradine, have now been accepted by the government. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), has just advised me across the table that the amendments have now been accepted by the government and will become part of the legislation.

         Can I just say at this stage how very pleased I am that this process has reached this end result for both Air Services of Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—the two new bodies that have been born out of the old Civil Aviation Authority. I commend the government for recognising the wisdom of the amendments that the opposition has been championing. We have been championing those amendments not so much on our own behalf but on behalf of a lot of other people who are vitally interested and involved in the aviation industry. In particular, the amendment that dealt with proposed subsection 20A(1) and (2) of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority legislation, which is commonly known outside as the AOPA amendment, brings Australia into line with other countries of like mind such as New Zealand, the US and the UK. This acceptance by the government of these amendments will put Australia in line with those countries which one would argue are very like-minded in terms of our culture and our aviation requirements. So that is a worthwhile thing.

         It also brings Australia into line with the requirements of ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation. As I pointed out in my speech when the legislation went through the House on the first occasion, one of the requirements of being a member of ICAO is that our regulations and our legislation mirror those of ICAO and that, where they do not, the Australian government indicates its intention not to apply those regulations and legislation in the same way as ICAO has so that other aviators around the world are aware of that difference. To hear from the parliamentary secretary—as we conversed across the table a few moments ago—that the government has picked up all of those amendments, including the one commonly known as the AOPA amendment, shows wisdom, even if belated, on behalf of the government.

         Before closing my remarks, I just pay some commendation to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association which has been very active in recent months in circles here in Canberra in trying to put forward the views of its membership. It is the largest such organisation in Australia, representing some 10,500 aircraft owners and pilots. Previously we did not hear much of that association. Indeed, I was surprised to find that the association actually had its headquarters based here in Canberra. Having had some interest in aviation over the last couple of years following the Monarch crash in June 1993 in which seven people were killed in my electorate, I would have thought that the association might have shown some interest in activities here. But certainly that has been belatedly corrected. The association's lobbying of members of both sides of this House to bring to the parliament the views of its 10,500 members has been an invaluable experience; one which I think has added to the strength of both the Air Services Bill that we have before us and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Bill.

         One of the key things that those of us who have been involved in the aviation safety inquiry have discovered is that, if we are to have a climate or a culture of compliance whereby people in the industry voluntarily comply with the regulations and the spirit of legislation, it is essential that the people who have to live with those rules, regulations and legislation actually understand them and agree with them. The force of our amendments recently in the House and those that my colleague Senator Parer, who represents the opposition in aviation matters, moved in the Senate ensures that those people who have to live and work with these regulations and this legislation every day of the week have an understanding of them and can support and apply them. That will mean some practical gains for aviation safety in this country.

         The introduction and passage of the legislation and the government's acceptance of all of those amendments have been a significant step forward as far as aviation safety is concerned in this country; one which will save many lives in the future. It will make aviation an industry that is easier to participate in and make it cheaper for people to fly. But, most importantly, it will ensure that aviation is safer and that fewer deaths occur in our civil aviation industry as a result of the inability of the regulator to properly regulate than has been the case in the past.

         —I will not take up the time of the House too long on this Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill. Taken on face value it appears to be a routine, innocuous bill requested by the Queensland government to improve accountability of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation by enabling it to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. This bill facilitates the decision by listing the QIDC under the definition of a `bank' in section 5 of the Banking Act.

         The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power as it relates to QIDC to the Commonwealth government. The purpose of this measure is to ensure that QIDC follows the requirements of and is subject to supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to prudential matters.

         As I said, on face value this is an innocuous bill. Why has there been such a controversy over this bill in Queensland? It is simply because the following question has not been answered: is the QIDC becoming a state bank under this legislation or not? When every other state, bar New South Wales, has experienced the disasters of the late 1980s in relation to their state banks, why is Queensland moving to a position of creating a state bank?

         The Commonwealth government, of course, is planning to fully privatise the Commonwealth Bank, which we on this side of the House have no objection to. We applaud that decision. In 1991 then Treasurer Keating used $2 billion of the Commonwealth Bank's money to bail out the State Bank of Victoria. The State Bank of South Australia lost $2.2 billion. The signs are all there that there is a danger in having a state bank, given the traditional way the Australian Labor Party acts.

         One has to go back into the history of Queensland to try to define the motivation of the Goss government. My state colleague Joan Sheldon in a statement dated 5 May 1995 said of this bill:

        This is the fulfilment of Mr Goss's 1988 promise to establish a Queensland State Bank. It is a promise the Premier pretended to bury several years ago. It is not acceptable to see the remains exhumed and presented to Queenslanders in such a misleading way by Mr Treasurer De Lacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the House of Mr Goss's opinion and the standing of the Cain government when he became leader of the Labor Party in Queensland not long before he made the promise to create a state bank. He said:

         The State Bank of Victoria, which cost taxpayers more than $2 billion when it collapsed in 1990, did not fall upon hard times by offering over-the-counter retail banking services. It became part of Australia's post-1980s financial wreckage because no amount of faith in unofficial Reserve Bank supervision could save it from the temptation to lend good money recklessly to bad business. It was so-called `entrepreneurial lending' that plunged Tasmania Bank into crisis in the same year and the State Bank of South Australia in 1991. In the latter case, the taxpayers copped a $2.2 billion bail-out of the bank, which, of course, was government guaranteed.

We asked him: is the QIDC a member of the Australian Bankers Association? Has it applied? He said unequivocally that yes, it had made inquiries to become part of the Australian Bankers Association. So any denial by the Goss government that the QIDC is not becoming a state bank is false. Mr De Lacy has been accused of misleading the state parliament over the issue. Mr Cullen's response this morning confirms that. The people of Queensland are nervous because of the experience of the 1980s and, because state banks and the QIDC are backed by taxpayers' guarantees, they are frightened that depositors' funds could go the same way as they did in other states and the taxpayer would have to back up the bad economic management of Labor governments.

         —The Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill provides the final chapter in the transformation of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation into a bank. As a result, it breaks yet another Goss Labor government election promise. As the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) pointed out, the Goss Labor government, after earlier giving a commitment to a state bank, prior to the last election made it abundantly clear that under no circumstances would Queensland have a state bank. There was no way that the Goss Labor government was going to do as he already promised earlier he would do—follow down the path of the failed Labor regimes in the southern states. There would be no state bank. But today, with this legislation, the Queensland Industry Development Corporation comes under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank.

         Frankly, if Queensland is to have a state bank, I think it is important that it have appropriate controls. No-one could trust the ALP on its past record to manage a bank. It is appropriate that the Reserve Bank should place some degree of supervision over its activities.

         The development and passage of this bill arise from Queensland's corporatisation process, which has been a part of the micro-economic reform agenda in Queensland. A working party was established in 1993 to look at the future of the QIDC and to consider what kind of model should be adopted for the QIDC as a corporatised body.That working party reported in February 1994 and the recommendations became legislation passed by the Queensland government in September 1994.

         The major elements of the changes to the QIDC which occurred as a part of this process were, first, that the assistance programs—the rural adjustment scheme and the disaster relief programs—that were in the past administered by the QIDC were transferred to a new body. A separate organisation was charged with that responsibility and the QIDC's strategic direction was changed to the provision of financial services only. In other words, it was to behave more like a traditional bank. The QIDC's performance was to be assessed by reference to its rate of return on funds. In other words, its primary objective was to be changed from providing services, particularly special services to industry and the rural sector, to making profits. The government gave the QIDC a clear direction that its main objective, its main target, was to make profits.

         The Queensland venture capital fund, which was a part of the QIDC's operation and which was designed specifically to provide an arm for venture capital for new industries and new proposals, was wound up. Its assets were transferred to the QIDC at market value and the QIDC took over the venture capital previously provided by the fund. This special venture capital fund performed a pretty useful function in Queensland and led to the establishment of a number of innovative new industries—including one in my own electorate, the establishment of a leather factory in Murgon, which came about because the QIDC was prepared to back it with some venture capital. Others in commerce and industry may have hesitated to provide capital because it was obviously a venture associated with some risk. But this factory was established and it has proved to be an excellent success. The QIDC has now sold its share in the operation to its other partners. This organisation is recording handsome profits and doing very well. That venture capital scheme was lost and with the loss of the scheme an opportunity for Queensland to attract some significant new industries to the state was also lost.

         The final part of this reform package was that a  prudential supervisory regime was to be established external to the QIDC and the government. That is what we are dealing with in this particular legislation. The QIDC, in relation to prudential supervision, will come under the control of the Reserve Bank, like other banks have been under the control of the Reserve Bank over the years.

         The question that now arises is: when is a bank not a bank? The Goss government tells us that the QIDC is still not a bank even though it is clearly operating as a bank. It has many of the functions of a normal bank. It is true that these functions do not involve over-the-counter facilities to hand out cash, but it behaves like a bank in almost every other regard. It operates primarily in Queensland, but has indicated its interest to expand to other states. In this legislation it is regarded as a bank. As the honourable member for Fairfax has just told us, it has now applied for membership to the Australian Bankers Association.

         So it squawks like a bank, it looks like a bank and it is behaving like a bank. I think the people of Queensland can be justifiably forgiven for believing that, in spite of the assurances of Premier Goss and Treasurer De Lacy, it is a bank, and hence brings with it the history of failed Labor state banks in other states.

         From a personal point of view, I regard the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, particularly over recent years, as having been something of a disappointment. It evolved from the old Agricultural Bank, which was essentially set up to provide concessional finance for the rural sector. When it became the QIDC, its charter was extended to also provide concessional finance to small business and to assist industry establish itself around the state. It had particular links with rural and provincial areas and was well thought of as a means to get industry established by providing longer term loans at concessional rates of interest. Those loans made many propositions realistically possible that previously may not have been financially achievable.

         So the QIDC did play a very useful part. It provided benefits to the rural sector and to small business. In so doing, it was certainly of great assistance to the rural and provincial sector. Sadly, as it has come more and more under the control of the Labor government, the directors that have been appointed have been less sympathetic to the needs of the rural sector and small business and it has been particularly motivated by profit.

         In fact, the QIDC recorded a record profit of $25.9 million—up 43 per cent—last financial year. Most of that ended up going into the state government coffers to help prop up the big spending Goss government. At the same time as the QIDC announced this record profit, it sent out notices to hard-pressed small businessmen and drought stricken rural producers announcing interest rate increases. Its priorities were clear. It was prepared to put up interest rate charges to struggling primary producers and small businessmen because it had to meet the profit targets of the money hungry Goss government. The QIDC was demonstrating its new direction, which was clearly to have a commercial rate of return on all of its investments as a part of the corporatisation process to produce windfall profits for the Labor government—basically, profiteering at the expense of the bush. This is the ultimate hypocrisy, because at the same time as these notices were going out to notify farmers and small businessmen of higher interest charges, the government was announcing new drought relief measures, interest rate subsidies and a whole range of other measures.

         When you tally these subsidies up, they worked out to be around only $10 per farmer Australia-wide, but they certainly got the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) a lot of favourable publicity. At the same time as the drought was at its worst around the eastern states of Australia and the Commonwealth was announcing these sorts of measures and providing assistance to the states, the QIDC—the traditional arm of farm finance in Queensland—was raising its interest rates to farmers. That really is a matter of concern.

         We now have a state bank in Queensland. It will trade like all other banks and will leave a gap in the marketplace in the provision of special assistance to small business and industry. The real concern about the passage of this legislation in Queensland and in other states is that we are entrusting another Labor government with a state bank. Of course the Queensland Labor government has only another 20-odd days to run, so the circumstances will change. But no prudent person could really ever trust a Labor government with money.

         Since the election of the Goss government in 1989-90, Queensland state taxes have increased from $2.3 billion to $4 billion—a 76 per cent increase in taxation in six years. Queensland has always been very proud of its low tax status. When the Goss government came to power, the average Queenslander paid $790 a year in state taxes. Now the average Queenslander pays $1,260 a year in state taxes. Queenslanders are still taxed slightly lower than people in other states, but we are down to being only $10 a week better off now than states like South Australia and Tasmania. Our proud record as a low tax state is clearly going by the board.

         There has been massive expenditure in a whole range of areas. It is beyond doubt that Labor is spending more on education, but there are fewer teachers in the classroom. It is spending more on police, but there are fewer police on the streets. It is spending more on health, but there are fewer nurses, closed hospital wards and horrific stories about patients dying in their hospital beds and not being found for two days. There are stories of waiting lists of up to four years for essential operations. This is the record of the way in which Labor has spent money in Queensland. There have also been cuts in road funding.

         The failed bureaucrats from the southern Labor regimes have been imported to Queensland. The only difference now between Queensland and the old southern Labor states is that Goss has not been in office for as long. Goss has had only six years in office in Queensland. Because of the quality of the Queensland economy that developed over such a long period before Goss, Queensland has been able to withstand much in these six years of Labor abuse. The quality of the Queensland economy is due entirely to the fact that it had 30 years free of Labor government. The state can ill afford to have the financial recklessness of a Labor government imposed upon it for yet another term of government.

         You only have to look at the way in which the Goss government handles money to realise that it is little different from the failed regimes of the southern states. The Goss Labor government squandered $6 million on the failed Compass Airlines. Goss did not seem to know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his mates had done a deal with Qantas and Ansett to lock a third airline out of the terminals for 30 years. The Goss Labor government kept throwing money at Compass Airlines. Has any other government in Australia spent $80 million on a car race which gives little or no returns to the state?

         We often hear Goss boasting about the state being without debt. It is a very strange statement to make, since the Commonwealth budget figures show that the debt repayments the Queensland government has to make to the Commonwealth this year alone total $900 million. In actual fact, whilst Queensland's debt is not as high as that of some other states, the Goss Labor government still owes $13.4 billion—$9.7 billion of it from the state government itself. When one looks at the way in which the Goss government has been managing its operations, one wonders why anyone would want to entrust a state bank to it. Why would you entrust a state bank to a government that is rapidly increasing taxes and rapidly increasing expenditure, but providing poorer services to the people of Queensland?

         During the debate on this bill last week, honourable members opposite referred frequently to what they called `corruption' in former Queensland governments. Those are the governments that produced the strong, healthy economy that Queensland boasts at the present time. Government members referred to four ministers who were put in gaol for apparent offences which cost Queensland a total of $26,000. Those offences included things such as a minister going to his son's graduation in a government car, a minister buying some hair care products, et cetera. I do not condone any of that, although I wonder whether any minister sitting opposite could withstand the government inquiries costing hundreds of millions of dollars that led to those paltry convictions.

         The $26,000 that was apparently spent as a result of the activities of those four ministers pales into insignificance compared with the fraud and maladministration of the Goss government.

The money was taken away from those ambulance committees and squandered by the government. Are they the sort of people you want to put in charge of running a state bank?

Cain, Wran, Kirner, Bannon, Burke and Lawrence were all trusted with running a state bank, yet they left behind legacies of mass destruction. We should never forget Wayne Goss's famous line at the Victorian Labor Party conference. He said, `I will do for Queensland what John Cain did for Victoria.'

         If we must have a state bank in Queensland and if there is ever a risk that it could be administered by a Labor government at some stage in the future, it is important that it be supervised as strongly as possible. Whilst the Reserve Bank can provide some degree of supervision, it is important for Queenslanders to recognise that they will have a state bank after this legislation which will need to be always managed carefully and wisely. The only way they can guarantee that their state bank is to be trusted is if they ensure that they never again have a Labor government. Fortunately, they have the opportunity on 15 July to make sure that the Queensland Industry Development Corporation is properly and wisely managed by a coalition government.

The evaluation was supported by independent analysis carried out by the economic evaluation unit of Price Waterhouse and Professor Ron Bewley, Professor of Econometrics at the University of New South Wales. That evaluation clearly demonstrated that the EMDG scheme is encouraging companies to spend additional revenue on export promotion and that the community is reaping significant rewards from EMDG through additional exports of Australian goods and services.

         Whilst Professor Bewley said that it is not meaningful to summarise the effectiveness of the EMDG scheme in a single multiplier, he argued that a multiplier of 15 to 25 is currently an indicative estimate for a firm from most industries that has been exporting for several years. In recognition of this, the government has decided to extend the scheme for a further four years beyond its current 1994-95 expiry date to grant year 1998-99.

         The government has decided also that, given the potential increases in exports from the tourism sector and the contribution that promotion of `single tourism services' can make, the EMDG scheme should be extended to include single service tourism providers. Providers of a package of three or more prescribed tourism `amenities' have been eligible for EMDG assistance since 1990-91. The intention at that time was to extend eligibility to the inbound package providers of tourism services who achieve bulk arrivals of overseas visitors. This bill provides for the scheme to be extended to include the provision of single tourism `amenities'. Providers of individual services, such as hotel rooms, will now be eligible to claim grants for the promotion of that single service alone.

         Some `technical' adjustments have been necessary to allow single service providers access to the scheme. Many single service providers derive a considerable proportion of their income from an Australian inbound operator. If left without amendment to the act, these particular earnings would be ineligible for all purpose under EMDG, as the act accepts as eligible only those earnings received directly by way of a contract with a non-Australian resident. However, it is recognised that many single service providers expend considerable funds promoting their amenity directly overseas. If not modified, the export performance test, in later years, could severely limit the grant payable.

         To minimise this disadvantage to single service providers and at the same time prevent the double counting of earnings, this bill provides for an apportionment of these particular earnings amongst the inbound operator and the single service provider.

         This bill also extends the scheme to allow the costs of departure taxes and visas as a legitimate component of overseas travel and closes a developing `loophole' with respect to the interpretation of costs eligible under the `free technical information' provisions of the legislation. Companies have been able to access EMDG without regard to their collective ability to attract funds. The grant maximum of $250,000 can be paid individually to any number of companies within a group of companies, thereby not limiting the amount of EMDG funding a company group can receive. Company groups generally have greater access to funds than individual organisations, and a limit of $250,000 per company group per grant year is considered appropriate. Group companies will remain free to pursue approved joint venture and consortium without these activities being attributed to the group.

The scheme incorporates also measures to prevent endless grants being paid to continuing business activities, which would be possible, for example, were a claimant able to become a `new' claimant by simply changing its name.

Earlier review of these proposals by the government found them to be unwarranted with respect to this particular industry.

         The export market development grants scheme was established in 1974 under the Export Market Development Grants Act to replace two existing export incentive arrangements that the government of the day considered unsatisfactory. Since its inception, however, there have been eight amendments to the legislation, and the one currently before us is the ninth.

         Taking the big issue approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), nobody needs to be reminded that Australia ran up a record deficit in merchandise trade in the December quarter, buying $2.1 billion more goods from the world than it sold. In the last three months of 1994 the volume of imports was 22 per cent higher than a year earlier, but the volume of exports rose only four per cent. If this history is not to your liking, try the current figures. In the March quarter, imports rose by a further four per cent from $18.2 billion at the end of the December quarter to $18.9 billion.

Following the introduction of the bill into the other chamber, a large number of representations were made by the printing and publishing industry that the proposal to limit a related company group's grant to $250,000 in any one year was unfair. I have two things to say about this. The first point is that people were notified of the proposed amendments some 12 months ago, so they could hardly be said to have been sprung on the industry. The second point is that the level of consultation between the industry and Austrade on the proposed amendment was in my view unsatisfactory. We will be looking at the impact that the legislation will have on the industry. If there is evidence of hardship after a reasonable period, we will be looking to the government to address the situation.

         The legislation is deficient in that it discriminates against single service providers. Under the scheme, the amount of grant eligibility for single service tourism providers is lower than that which is payable to other industry sectors. Accordingly, I endorse the proposed amendments that will increase the grant eligibility rate to single service tourism providers from 25c in the dollar, which is proposed in the legislation, to 50c in the dollar. This would enable tourist businesses to qualify for the provisions of samples and would allow tourism ventures to form joint venture arrangements.

         A grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants who have received eight or more grants are not allowed to receive further grants, and claimants who have received at least two prior grants are subject to a performance test which is assessed against costs such as travel expenses, special promotion literature and overseas representation. The Australian Trade Commission, which administers the EMDG scheme, considers the main benefits of the scheme to be that grant funding is guaranteed by legislation, the grant is cash in hand and the grant directly supports the majority of expenditure categories likely to be incurred by the exporter. In 1993-94, export market development grants to the value of $195 million were paid to 3,277 claimants. This compares with 2,473 claims with a value of $181 million in 1993-94 and 2,002 claims worth $143 million for the year before.

EMDG claimants increased their spending on export marketing promotion in anticipation of receipt of a grant which results in more exports.

         Revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports achieved are estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the government. Much of the growth in the scheme has come from the services sector. The major scheme parameters, such as the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, the number of grants and performance test, are broadly appropriate and changes are not recommended. Certain adjustments are recommended to improve the scheme without change to the major parameters.

         The number of the firms which claim grants and then drop out of the scheme is a concern and measures will be implemented to ensure that early claimants, and those intending to claim, are advised of the range of services available to better equip them for exporting. The scheme should be extended to all claimants in the tourism sector, but the government may wish to consider paying a lower grant rate. The last recommendation was that the scheme should be extended for a further five years. This bill takes on the guts of those recommendations and puts them into a legislative form.

         The report also made a range of other interesting comments in relation to the question of exporting from this country. The report showed that EMDG claimants—some 70 per cent of them—are small to medium sized firms with less than $5 million in turnover a year, exports of less than $1 million, and/or fewer than 26 employees.

         That question of smaller and medium sized firms and the role they play in exporting is consistent with earlier findings of the Australian Manufacturing Council McKinsey report into manufacturing exporters and the LEK service export study. Both studies report a trend towards smaller, innovative enterprises taking up the call to export. The number of service companies claiming the EMDG is growing and is currently at 45 per cent of all grants, with manufacturers at 37 per cent, traders at 15 per cent and primary producers at three per cent.

         The report also highlighted another problem which is of concern to both sides of the House. Up to 90 per cent of Australian manufacturing companies do not export to any significant extent. Research also shows that the EMDG claimants actually increase their own spending on export market promotion by more than the value of their grants. A very important point is that the typical mature EMDG exporters could generate additional exports of up to 15 to 25 times the value of the grant received. In other words, for every dollar spent by those exporters an additional $15 to $25 can be generated and is generated in export income. The McKinsey report stated with respect to the EMDG scheme:

I will refer to some of those because they raise some of the issues mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). Although it may be hard to evaluate this scheme—and this was certainly raised by the auditor; sometimes with programs that are not capable of being properly audited in the way he would like—the fact is that there is a range of evidence on individual case studies and overall evaluations that points to the fact that it has the highest praise that is required in these circumstances: the endorsement of the people who use it.

        The bill also represents part of the government's overall matrix of policy in trade and implements part of the government's Working Nation process of last year. The development of the scheme for a further five years should lead to a situation where approximately 5,000 exporters a year are assisted and helped to ensure that export growth continues, at a cost of $231 million in 1994-95 increasing to $290 million in 1997-98.

         As I said, you have to look at this as being part of an overall program. You also have to look at it as a piece of legislation which finetunes an existing scheme. The member for Maranoa commented that there has been a range of changes to this legislation over time. That is a fact of what we do in government and a fact of the business of this House. At least 80 per cent of the legislation we deal with in this place is amending legislation, because government does evolve, schemes change and circumstances change. It is part of the government's job and role to ensure that we adjust to those changes as required in order to make sure that what we do is effective. I do not think members opposite would consider that the way to go would be to have a situation where you put in place something and never changed it if circumstances required that change, if circumstances that occur in industry adjust and require an adjustment to be made by government.

         That is because the bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives last year, 1994, was substantially amended by the Senate. The new bill was sent back to the House of Representatives to deal with it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who introduced this new bill to the House a few minutes ago, outlined that the government would be opposing three measures in this bill which were put there by the opposition and other parties in the Senate and the Senate passed the bill.

         There are four major amendments proposed by the bill and three additionals which are now part of the bill. The first is to extend the operation of the export market development grants scheme from 1994-95 to 1998-99, and I highly approve of that. The second is to provide eligibility under the EMDG scheme to single-service tourism providers. The only problem with that is that the rate of provision is only half the provision to other providers of export services throughout the economy, including the manufacturing industry. The third purpose is to allow departure taxes and visa costs as eligible expenses under the EMDG scheme, of which I heartedly approve. The fourth purpose is to limit related company groups grants under the EMDG scheme to a quarter of a million dollars in any one year, which is probably quite appropriate.

Essentially, they were the inbound tourism operators. That scheme said, if you are a single source tourism operator—if you run a bus line, if you own a hotel, if you have a reception centre, if you have a park or garden or a railway, if you have a swimming centre, run a horse-riding operation or Harley Davidson tours of the ranges, or any of these things that people might like to come and see and do—the government will not help you; it will only help you if you make nuts and bolts or supply education services overseas.

         In my electorate of La Trobe I have two private sector tourism bodies. They are terrific organisations. They work their backsides off trying to promote international tourism to a region: Mount Dandenong, the Dandenong Ranges and the surrounding foothills. We have an awful lot to offer. I said in my first speech that La Trobe was arguably the most physically beautiful electorate in all of Australia. I will stick with that because it is true. It is, as an entity, the most physically beautiful electorate in all of Australia.

         That area has many beautiful and outstanding features. Many of them derive from the fact that, since the turn of the century, we quit cutting down the trees on Mount Dandenong and its ranges.

         Liberal state governments in Victoria have had a heck of a lot to do with the fact that the Dandenong Ranges today are so beautiful: they amended planning acts; they bought back from private individuals tens of thousands of acres of land in the hills so that the trees and ferns could grow again—so that we could have the Dandenong Ranges National Park and Sherbrooke Forest set aside for the community. They have been responsible for overturning some of the old, inappropriate planning laws which were applicable back at the turn of the century in order to ensure that the lots were not too small, and so that people could live in the hills in harmony with nature. That is important to me and to my constituents. It is also important to all who live in the small villages of Mount Dandenong and the ranges.

And they do, too. It is a fact. Between all the buses, all the cars and the rubbish, the tourists mess things up and we have to clean it up.

Our problem with the changes the government wants to make to the bill which is now in front of this House is that these small tourism operators should not be treated differently from small manufacturers or small service providers in any other part of industry, the education sector or whatever. They should be treated the same. If a small manufacturer or group of manufacturers get that 50 per cent rebate of the eligible expense in marketing their products overseas, then so should my small tourism operators in my electorate of La Trobe. They have no other venue for explaining to people overseas who go into a travel agent and say, `I would like to go to Australia. What can I do?' They do not know. The travel agent has no brochures. He has no information. He has no small package tours.

         —Last week the government entered the eighth Accord with the declining trade union movement—declining in numbers and declining in influence. However, they overlooked a major backdown on the unfair dismissal law. At April 1995 the government's new unfair dismissal laws had been operating for some 13 months and had generated 8,736 unfair dismissal claims. Take that figure very carefully and see how many people that involves and how many employers this law, which was supposed to improve industrial relations in Australia, affects.

         This compares with the government's much touted enterprise flexibility agreements, of which there were only 45 in place during this same period of time. This government-union deal gave us the infamous unfair dismissal laws, which have cost jobs in regional Australia and throughout all Australia because employers will not take on employees. They are very fearful of the procedure the unfair dismissal process will create if they wish to change their work force for some good, sound reason.

         However, after a lot of pressure from the opposition and many commentators, the government last week conceded, as was obvious to everyone in the private sector, that the unfair dismissal laws were not working. They are a burden to small employers who particularly were worried about this and have cost many jobs because, as I say, employers were not prepared to put new people on because of the fear of the process of removing them.

         Even the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, said that many of these laws were supported on spurious technicalities rather than the general thrust of unfair dismissal. Premier Bob Carr in New South Wales also criticised the legislation on the grounds that it was costing jobs, particularly for young Australians. Here we have a Labor premier in New South Wales criticising one of the major platforms of the present Labor government. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) himself makes the claim that it makes a good system better. Yet, reluctantly, he was forced to make the change to get ready for the next election.

         According to the minister, the changes will involve just a relaxing in the procedural requirements, allowing arbitration in the Industrial Relations Commission if both parties agree; rather than going to the Industrial Relations Court, involving all the technical arrangements in that court and limiting the extent to which federal laws can take precedence over state laws.

         It is worth looking at some of the cases that are well known to members of this House and members who are interested in industrial relations. I draw to the attention of the House a couple of these cases. In the case of Conagra Wool, the company was forced to pay $11,661 to a worker who had been absent for 35 days over a two-year period, including 20 days without a medical certificate. He was given two written warnings, counselled and placed on a monthly review, during which he was absent from work without a certificate for a day. The court found that the employer could not prove that the man was not ill on the day he was sacked. The company was ordered to reinstate the worker with full back pay of $11,661. This is a clear case of problems with the burden of proof borne by the employer himself.

The court found that the dismissal was justified but was not procedurally fair because the employee had not been given an ultimatum and a chance to rectify the problem. The employer was forced to pay two weeks pay, $860, but also faced a bill for $3,000 in legal costs.

         —This evening I wish to speak on the appalling prospects for the future of education in Western Australia under the state Liberal government, the Court government. This is as a result of the announcement by the Court government in the last week or so of the so-called good start program. The good start program is advertised to be `Good start: an investment in our children's future'. What this code is for is a late start, a bad start, a bad handicap, delaying investment and prejudicing the future of children in Western Australia.

         The good start program came out of the blue and was announced on 20 June 1995. There are three reasons why I have an interest in this matter. Firstly, the Commonwealth provides nearly $53 million worth of funds for government primary schools in Western Australia in the current financial year. Secondly, there are thousands of families in my electorate and in Western Australia who will be massively and adversely affected by this move. Thirdly, this will prejudice the future education of my 3 1/2-year-old son and my 18-month-old daughter.

         In the case of my own son, the effect will be that, rather than commencing year 1 in the year in which he is five, he will now complete year 1 in the year in which he turns seven! That will apply across the board for all young Western Australian children, commencing next year, 1996, with a scaled introduction until the year 2000, when all the appropriate year qualification dates will be 30 April rather than 31 December. It is quite clear that the only reason for the introduction of this program—while said to be based on an educational philosophy that older children do better than younger children, which in my view is patent nonsense—is to shift costs from the state government to ordinary families.

         There is a range of obvious reasons as to why this program ought not proceed. In addition to shifting costs from government at the state level, where it lies, to ordinary Western Australian families, you will see disparity of school commencement ages between private schools and government schools and the consequent difficulties that will cause with transfers. There is the obvious leaving-age problem, as there has been no similar accommodation for the age at which children leave school. In addition, parents who have children under the age of five, and have children already at kindergarten, pre-primary or at school, will find that their youngest children will lag somewhat behind their elder children.

In a very short space of time, I had no trouble in raising 508 signatures on this petition from the people of Lyne, deploring the actions of the French government and of President Chirac in proposing to conduct further nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll.

         We have heard recently that President Chirac has said the decision is irrevocable. I think people right across Australia are not really prepared to accept that answer. It is something of grave concern to everybody in Australia because it is happening in our own backyard when it is something that should be happening in France's backyard. The petitioners are asking that the government extend economic and military sanctions on the French government and that it go further than it has done so far.

         I think it has been interesting to note that the reactions of the government have been a little slow in moving behind the reactions of the people of Australia. The outrage and the protests from right across Australia over this decision that has been taken by the French government certainly have been unprecedented in Australian history. They are not the reactions of a specific interest group or a minority group; they are broadly based expressions of outrage at this decision that has been taken by France, which flies in the face of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

         As I say, the actions and the outrage that have been expressed by the Australian people are very broadly based. We had a group of, I think, CWA ladies having a meeting, and they asked for a copy of the petition that we were circulating in the electorate so they could put their signatures on it. Ten or 15 years ago, that probably would not have happened. It just indicates the depth of concern right across Australia. I think this may have been misread last week or the week before by the government, which was reflected in its weaker than expected actions against the French government.

         I also note the campaign that has been started and is being sponsored by the Wayside Chapel—not normally, I suppose, an organisation that gets involved in this type of semipolitical campaign but certainly one that feels very strongly about this issue. The `We means no' campaign is being sponsored by Reverend Ray Richmond of the Wayside Chapel. As part of that campaign, a rally was held on the Town Green in Port Macquarie last Sunday to highlight the outrage within the community in my electorate of Lyne towards the decision that has been taken by the French government. It certainly would not hurt for anybody who is of a mind to support the `We means no' campaign that is being sponsored by the Wayside Chapel.

I just wanted to highlight the depth and breadth of the outrage being expressed right throughout all sections of the community across Australia at the decision that has been taken by the French government and to highlight the fact that the community is urging our Australian government to take much stronger measures than have been taken so far to protest to the French government about this nuclear testing that is being proposed take place in our backyard in the South Pacific.

         —For just over 12 months I have been convening a caucus committee on mental health. This arose from the federal government's view that we needed to do more in the area of mental health. Mental health is one of those areas under our constitution and in our history that has traditionally been the role of state governments. It is one of a number of areas of social policy which, I guess, has been neglected partly because it has traditionally been left to state governments.

         In the wake of the Burdekin report released in 1993, the government felt it was fairly important to raise its profile in the mental health area. The national mental health strategy was put together and endorsed by all health ministers in April 1992. That strategy clarifies the roles and responsibilities for the states, territories and the Commonwealth as the basis for a national approach to mental health reform. To support the mental heath strategy, the Commonwealth committed $135 million in the 1992-93 budget and a further $133.6 million in last year's budget, bringing the total amount to over $250 million over the four-year period. A significant proportion of this money is made available to states and territories to assist them in service restructuring in a manner consistent with the strategy.

         One of the most important areas in mental health is the area of stigma and our attempts to overcome stigma in the community. The issue of community attitudes and stigmatisation has been identified as a priority area at the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council—AHMAC. The Commonwealth government has provided $8 million over four years to develop and implement the mental health community awareness program as a national project of the national mental health strategy. To that end, I was very pleased to attend last April the launch of the community awareness program—a series of television advertisements and other initiatives put forward by the department and by the government. These are very important. Just prior to that launch I had attended a conference sponsored by ANAMH—the Australian National Association for Mental Health—which identified that, of all the priorities for mental health that body has, the issue of removal of stigma and stigmatisation not only of mental health consumers but also of mental health professionals is felt very keenly. Therefore, that is a very important area. I am very pleased that, in the last year or so, the federal government has taken this issue on board and has produced, and is continuing to produce, advertising programs and education programs—including in schools—to overcome stigma, fear and misconceptions about mental health.

         It is because of the importance of the role of leadership in the community and the importance of members of this House, for example, setting a good example to people overcoming fears and stigmatisation and to not trivialise the issue of mental health that I was particularly angry last Wednesday night in the adjournment debate to hear the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in her attempt to score a political point, make a personal attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). She claimed that she was concerned about the Prime Minister's mental wellbeing, that she had spoken to a psychiatrist and that she had received an opinion which reflected on the Prime Minister's mental health.

         I am sure the Prime Minister is not particularly worried about anything that the honourable member for Mackellar might have to say. I do not need to come in to defend the Prime Minister but I would have thought that, at a time when we are trying to raise awareness about mental health issues and the stigma that exists in the community about mental health, it is pretty irresponsible for a member of parliament to come in here and trivialise that issue and use it as a vehicle to score points against the Prime Minister or anyone else. I thought it was a pretty disgraceful episode last Wednesday evening in the adjournment debate to hear the honourable member for Mackellar use mental health as a vehicle to make a political point and attack the Prime Minister. I would say the same if she did it to anyone else. It was a pretty outrageous stunt. I think that members of parliament should be a bit more responsible and mindful of what they say in this chamber about issues as sensitive and important as mental health.

         I have received some correspondence from the secretary of the Goornong branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation, Mr Greg O'Sullivan, who wrote to me expressing the concerns of his branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation about the reduced funding for the CSIRO. The research bodies in Australia need to be working well in advance of primary industry. The suggestion has been made by the Goornong branch that they should be working some 20 to 25 years ahead in their research program to look at innovative and entrepreneurial undertakings that can be achieved in the primary industry sector.

         One of the things that it addresses is that it would improve the export performance of Australia. That is very sorely needed at the moment. Australia does need to boost its export performance, particularly in the primary industry sector. Our nearest competitor, New Zealand, has stolen a bit of a march on us with its promotion and marketing skills in primary industry products. It is incumbent upon Australia to wrest back that marketing lead that the New Zealanders have obtained over us. One of the ways in which that can be achieved is to have the CSIRO and the other research bodies carry out properly funded research to try to improve the quality and performance of our primary industry sector.

I call on the government to amend the act to ensure a right of veto for local councils in the event of an impasse between the community and companies in relation to building proposals and to ensure maximum collocation facilities on existing structures before the construction of new ones.

          I make this point because recently we have had two proposals of particular concern. One was at Joondalup, where there already was a water tower which could quite easily have accommodated the Vodaphone proposal for additional communications equipment. Another tower was built, which looks a bit like a minuet to a certain extent, right in the middle of a suburban area. It looks unsightly and is out of character with the rest of the buildings. It has quite unnecessarily upset the local residents.

          There is a proposal right now to erect communications equipment by Vodaphone on top of the Mount Flora water tank, which is on top of Mount Flora—an important area, particularly in terms of our conservation and coastal heritage in the area of North Beach—on the coastline of my electorate towards its southern extremity. Ironically, Vodaphone in its promotional or explanatory publications made the observation that the Mount Flora water tank was not used; it was an unused water tank. Let me point out the following to Vodaphone: the Mount Flora water tank was converted some years ago to become the Mount Flora museum. It is one of the most important community museums within the Perth metropolitan area, in particular because of its exhibitions and dioramas of life in particular ages or periods of our history.

          North Beach has played an important role in the history of our local community. It is very important that Vodaphone carefully consider the objections of local residents. It is important that the City of Stirling consider the objections raised by the Northern Suburban Historical Society, the Coastal Heritage Society and local residents. I am totally opposed to this proposal. I will work to make sure it does not come to pass because it will certainly demean the environmental image of the area, which I mentioned earlier is an important part of our coastal heritage in the north metropolitan region.

It might be remembered by honourable members that this body is still a government business enterprise, that is, it is owned by taxpayers and controlled by the government. This GBE is in a position where it is asking the government to do its very best to sell off the organisation.

        When collecting labour force statistics the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) does not take into account whether or not persons are in receipt of a Department of Social Security payment. In ABS labour force statistics, a person is classified as employed or unemployed depending upon their answers to a detailed questionnaire which is designed to determine whether that person is in work, or if not in work, whether they are actively looking for and are available to start work.

        When the move toward direct credit was initiated in 1984, the Government expected to save in a full year: $15 million in postal costs, $16.9 million in overpayments and $7.5 million in staffing costs. It was also expected that banks would benefit by an estimated $35-85 million a year, both from the fact that significant amounts of money were now being deposited directly with them and from lower transaction and processing costs—moving from cheque cashing to greater use of automatic teller machines.

        (2) The Government approved a proposal in its 1993-94 Budget to fund a trial of electronic banking in the Department of Social Security. Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT as the project is known, is seen as another method for delivering payments to social security customers. It would complement payment directly to bank accounts which is the Department's principal payment delivery medium.

        Typically, EBT would allow selected customers to access automatic teller machines and point-of-sale devices in the electronic funds transfer networks to obtain cash or pay for goods without the need to operate an account at a financial institution.
