                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to introduce the Health Insurance Amendment (General Practitioners and Quality Assurance) Bill 2020. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973—that's the HIA—to support simplifying Medicare administrative processes for recognition as a specialist general practitioner, GP, for Medicare purposes under the HIA<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and will align Medicare eligibility for GPs with the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme, NRAS, requirements<span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>The bill also removes legal ambiguity in relation to the definition of a quality assurance activity in part VC of the HIA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current pathway to recognise a GP in the HIA requires a medical practitioner who has gained fellowship as a GP to apply to Services Australia for access to GP rebates and also to apply to the Medical Board of Australia, the MBA, for specialist registration in the field of general practice. Implementation of the bill will mean that Services Australia's systems will, through an automated data exchange, utilise national registration data held by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, Ahpra, to determine this access, removing this duplicative process for GPs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRAS commenced in 2010 and provides a nationally consistent process for registering specialist GPs. This includes mandatory reporting requirements for continuing professional development, CPD. Ahpra, in administering the national registration process, provides the most up-to-date and accurate data on all registered practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will provide a new definition of 'general practitioner' as one who is a specialist in the field of general practice under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law 2009<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>(Qld), as applied by states and territories. A corresponding 'national law' is also implemented by Western Australia. Outdated provisions in the HI Act providing for medical practitioners to gain access to higher GP rebates will be repealed. There will be grandfathering and transition arrangements made in the Health Insurance Regulations 2018 to ensure that GPs who are currently eligible for higher GP rebates will continue to be able to access these higher rebates. This includes the cohort of GPs who are or have been on the vocational register who meet the eligibility criteria. These are medical practitioners who do not necessarily hold fellowship in general practice as they were in practice prior to fellowship and specialist registration becoming a requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, RACGP, and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, ACRRM, will continue to be critical in setting professional standards for the specialty of general practice in Australia and will work with the MBA to ensure continuing quality in general practice. The bill will not impact on Medicare eligibility for international medical graduates or on Australian-trained graduates who are on a workforce program or a GP training pathway with either ACRRM or RACGP. The bill also makes a minor but important technical change in relation to the Commonwealth Qualified Privilege Scheme. It will not affect the operation of part VC of the HIA but will remove an ambiguity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Qualified Privilege Scheme under part VC of the HIA is designed to encourage participation in quality assurance activities that are aimed at improving the quality of the healthcare system. The purpose of the Commonwealth Qualified Privilege Scheme is to protect from public disclosure any personal and identifiable information that becomes known solely as a result of a declared quality assurance activity, and it protects certain healthcare professionals involved in the activity from civil liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be eligible for a declaration, a quality assurance program must be funded under at least one of the Commonwealth Health funded programs covered by the definition. This bill will repeal an outdated reference to a former appropriation act and replaces it with the correct reference to the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. Despite the previous reference to the outdated appropriation legislation, the bill also ensures that activities declared on or after 1 July 2009 are taken to have been valid declarations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the NRAS in 2010 for health professions has modernised the regulation of health professions by creating a single and national regulatory framework. Streamlining the process for GPs to be recognised for appropriate access to Medicare rebates removes duplication and red tape and allows for a simpler, more efficient process for GPs to qualify for GP specialty and reduces processing for Services Australia. I present the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I'm very pleased to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights third scrutiny report of 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report contains a technical examination of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law, as required under the committee's statutory mandate. It sets out the committee's consideration of 12 bills introduced into the parliament between 10 February and 13 February 2020, and legislative instruments registered under the Federal Register of Legislation between 9 January and 5 February 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As members know, the committee's mandate, as set out in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, is to examine legislation for compatibility with human rights: defined to mean the rights contained in the seven core international human rights treaties to which Australia is a party. In understanding how human rights are to be applied, the committee has regularly looked to the way in which UN human rights treaty bodies have interpreted the treaties, as well as to the interpretations by comparable regional, international and domestic human rights courts of other countries. While none of this is binding on how the committee carries out its scrutiny function, it can assist the committee in gaining a broader understanding of the content and application of human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where a provision in a bill or instrument appears to limit rights, the committee considers whether any limitation is reasonable, necessary and proportionate. To do so it asks three key questions:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">whether the limitation is aimed at achieving a legitimate objective;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">whether there is a rational connection between the limitation and that objective; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">whether the limitation is proportionate to that objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In undertaking its task, the committee has access to specialist human rights law advice, which guides the committee as to the application of these legal tests on a case-by-case basis. The committee's deliberations need to be underpinned by this legal advice, as having full consideration of well-established legal tests and precedents assists the committee to accurately identify the rights engaged by legislation and the permissibility under international law of any limitation on these rights. While we as parliamentarians are well equipped to consider debatable questions of whether a measure appears to be reasonable, necessary and proportionate, we do so based on this important legal advice. This is vital to ensure the legitimacy of the process of technical legislative scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where further information is required to determine these questions the committee writes to the relevant minister seeking clarification. In this report the committee seeks further information in relation to two bills and has made an advice-only comment in relation to two more. The process of requesting information from the legislation proponents reflects the committee's role in establishing and maintaining a dialogue regarding the human rights implications of legislative measures, which contributes to the broader respect for and recognition of human rights in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I commend the committee's report No. 3 of 2020 to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  We are talking about appropriation bills that underpin the budget and the way governments spend money. And today we've had an extraordinary example of how the government is spending money. We found out that $10 million was spent by this government for 'the noted country town of North Sydney' so that it could get a swimming pool upgrade, which is fantastic! When challenged on why North Sydney got $10 million in another example of the rorts that have been uncovered in the last few months, the mayor described this as a totally justifiable decision on the basis that people from the country would swim in North Sydney and this would justify a regional grant. I've heard of Pitt Street farmers but not Boorowa backstrokers—and that's what this is facilitating in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for North Sydney is singing 'I've been everywhere man'—from Waverton to Wollstonecraft, from Mosman to Artarmon, from Chatswood to Cremorne, from Naremburn to Castlecrag! This is a joke. It goes to show you how bad this government is when they try to funnel into North Sydney $10 million of money that was supposed to support the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But who knows, this could be a plan by the member for North Sydney to usurp the Deputy Prime Minister by becoming a National Party MP in North Sydney. I think this is what we are looking at; they could have a National Party MP from North Sydney. That's the type of A-grade rorting that the National Party has become renowned for—and now they're bringing it to North Sydney. What an absolute embarrassment it is that you could use taxpayer funds in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's where the joke ends. The way this government spends money on rorts—be it sports rorts or be it road rorts—has made a joke of programs like this, which notionally should be providing support to communities. And it demonstrates yet again that this is a budget from a government with no plan. They have no clue, no idea, no plan and no care for the Australian people. When it comes to using a budget that might be able to, for example, deal with the skills crisis—every industry is saying they don't have enough people—we have a government with no plan for how to fix that and no funding to back it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's costing people more and more to go to a doctor. Every time they go to a doctor the out-of-pocket expenses have jumped up. In my part of western Sydney, for the people who I represent, they've jumped up 40 per cent. Yet there's no plan by this government to make health care and access to it easier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got clogged roads and clogged railways in our part of Sydney, and yet all we've got, when it comes to infrastructure, is an ad plan. We've got a plan that can advertise claimed spending but none of the actual dollars going to the people when they need it most, which is right now, and to also help the economy on the way through. Again, this budget has no answers for people who want to see those types of things—health, schools, broader education, infrastructure—fixed up; nothing. But you can get $10 million for a pool in North Sydney as you're trying to save people from losing their seats, potentially, either there or elsewhere. You'll be—</span>

                    </a>  Exactly, I am; I could be here all week because there are so many rorts, Minister, that we could talk about. But this is an example of this cavalier approach to the use of money being picked up from that part of the government benches and spread out over here. We can definitely get a sense, too, of the outrage from the general public about the way in which this has happened. They know this is a big issue: sports rorts and road rorts and the fact that people are missing out. People, in good faith, are putting in applications, wanting either to upgrade their local sports ground or to see infrastructure in their area upgraded; they believe they've got a good case; and they're denied. Why? Because, again, it's a government that only spends to save itself, as opposed to helping the Australian people. It's not good enough. In the urban infrastructure program, we've seen the member for Robertson do very well, but that's only one part of the Central Coast; that's not a broad approach to dealing with the Central Coast. People there are stuck in cars for hours, travelling from the Central Coast to Sydney for work, or on trains that they're forced to use because they don't want to use the roads. But only one part of the Central Coast gets the benefit of an urban infrastructure funding program. That goes to show you: this is not needs based; it's not evidence based; it's politically based; and it's got to end. Again, this is a budget that doesn't reflect a plan, an idea, a clue or a care for the people of Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to advise the member that his comments earlier were not actually accurate. Today I rise to speak to the appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020. These bills will provide additional monetary support for government programs, both new and existing, which will be delivered over the course of this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is able to deliver funding to projects right across Australia through our strong management of the economy, and it is this responsible economic management that allows the government to quickly act in the face of challenges such as devastating bushfires, floods and drought, or by investing in important measures to keep Australians safe in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It is also this strong economic management that, despite the many challenges that we've faced as a country over the past few months, allows for investment in vital infrastructure upgrades and local projects in communities all around Australia, including in my electorate of Robertson. Today I'll share just a few examples of the many, many projects that the Morrison government will be investing in to improve the lives of residents on the Central Coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the federal government announced a $35 million package in the budget for additional car spaces at Gosford and Woy Woy train stations. This was part of a $541.2 million congestion funding boost for New South Wales under the national Urban Congestion Fund. The commuter car parks in Gosford and Woy Woy are regularly full by 7 am, forcing many to look for street parking that can, in some instances, be a very long way from the station. I heard from many frustrated locals who were desperate for more car parking spaces. Thanks to this investment by the Morrison government, these upgrades will make a monumental difference to the lives of many commuters on the Central Coast who travel to Sydney or Newcastle daily via public transport. Like many Central Coast residents, I'm keen to see the car parks at both Gosford and Woy Woy become a reality as soon as possible. I understand that scoping and development activities are already underway, with locations for the car parking and construction time frames to be released in due course. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to boosting car-parking capacity for commuters on the Central Coast, the Morrison government is continuing to work on improving mobile phone coverage along the train lines between the Central Coast and Sydney. The first mobile base station was launched at Narara train station in October last year, along with free wi-fi at Lisarow, Mount Colah and Tuggerah train stations. The second of the planned 22 mobile stations is now almost complete, with the launch of Narara's Showground Road site expected in early March. Improving connectivity for local commuters is important, with one in four people living on the Central Coast commuting by train each day—a journey that can take more than two hours. Building the new mobile infrastructure will reduce mobile black spots and allow passengers to catch up on work or the news, and stay in touch with friends and family. While I understand the ongoing frustration of commuters with delays of this project's completion, I would like to acknowledge the strong collaboration between Sydney Trains, Telstra, and the federal and state governments on ensuring these vital upgrades are completed as quickly as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $70 million Central Coast Roads Package is another example of what is possible under a government that can manage the economy. In 2019, this government committed a record $70 million to improving 29 local roads that were in dire need of attention. This followed our local roads petition, launched in 2017; over 700 members of the community in my electorate raised their concerns and had their voices heard. It's only because of the Morrison government's strong financial management that we are able to invest this record funding, which will improve the experience of so many people who live on the Central Coast. I'm pleased to advise that Central Coast Council has already started work on these upgrades, with drainage work on Mutu Street in Woy Woy complete, and work on kerb and gutter replacement expected to wrap up in April. I understand that Central Coast Council are scheduled to begin construction on Glenrock Parade in Tascott next month. I understand that upgrades to 20 of the 29 roads will have commenced by the end of next year, which I'm sure will be welcome news to many who have been waiting years to see their roads upgraded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also committed to $4.3 million in funding to Central Coast Council to upgrade vital roads, and install much-needed footpaths in North Avoca. It will see Tramway Road, View Street and Elgata Avenue fully reconstructed, including with curb and guttering and new footpaths. This commitment came about after a group of local mothers from North Avoca advocated for upgrades due to a number of concerns they had about safety in the area, particularly for pedestrians, due to the lack of footpaths. I understand that Central Coast Council has commenced the design process for this project, with a concept design scheduled to be prepared in the coming months. I look forward to seeing local families being able to walk with their toddlers and their prams down to the beach and the local shops without concern, when this project is completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has also provided a $9 million investment, a very important investment, for a women's residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre on the Central Coast, known as The Glen centre for women. This investment—I do believe this is an incredibly important announcement—followed a feasibility study that was supported by a consultation process involving over 400 women, including Indigenous elders and more than 40 organisations from community groups, peak bodies and research and service providers. Of the total $9 million in funding provided in the 2019 budget, $4.5 million will go towards building the new facility, with an additional $1½ million per annum for three years to cover operational costs. I'm delighted to say that The Glen centre for women is a step closer to becoming a reality with a funding agreement executed just this week. I understand The Glen will now turn their attention to identifying the most appropriate location for the women's centre to be built.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An additional health initiative funded by this government is the delivery of funding for another linear accelerator, which will boost cancer treatment capacity at Central Coast Cancer Centre. The $3.8 million investment in the 2019 budget provides for a third linear accelerator machine. The machines are vital in the treatment of cancer as they allow doctors to target cancer cells while protecting the surrounding healthy tissue. This extra linear accelerator machine will make a dramatic difference in my community once installed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of this government's investment in local communities is the $8.25 million upgrade of the Umina recreational precinct. This funding will allow for the redevelopment of the existing skate park, BMX track and basketball court, and a new football club house for Umina United Soccer Club, a new integrated community facility and additional car parking. It was clear after speaking to residents in my local community and receiving a petition with over 2,000 signatures that these upgrades would make a significant difference to those who are living on the peninsula. The redevelopment will not only improve social cohesion within the community but deter antisocial behaviour from our young people. In addition, the facelift will draw regional sporting competitions to the state-of-the-art facilities, boosting our tourism and local economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A concept plan is being finalised after 18 months of community consultation, with a detailed plan now available on the Your Coast - Our Voice website. Construction of the Umina recreational precinct is due to start in the coming weeks, with the upgrade expected to be complete by late 2020. I join with many others from right across the peninsula who cannot wait to see this fantastic project finally underway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government committed $80,000 to upgrade the scoreboard at Woy Woy Oval. This funding has allowed the local sporting clubs to use this ground to install a state-of-the-art scoreboard to further encourage the youth within the community to participate in local sporting events. The Morrison government also committed $1.45 million for a new amenities block at the Lemon Grove Netball Courts at Ettalong Beach. I was happy to advocate for this project after seeing firsthand the poor state of their existing amenities blocks. These upgrades to sporting facilities will provide immense benefit to all who regularly utilise them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we're a step closer to creating a world-class health and innovation precinct in Gosford as $18 million was committed last year by this government to build on the vision of the Central Coast Medical School and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>This $18 million in funding will assist with the development of a precinct in the heart of Gosford to increase educational opportunities in the region and create a centre of excellence in integrated health care. Additional benefits of this investment will see several new degrees offered by the University of Newcastle. One of my top priorities is attracting—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Last night, I, with many of our colleagues here in this chamber, attended a very important event. At that event, many of us held candles just like the one I'm holding. This candle was from the vigil that we held last night in honour, in mourning and also in celebration of the lives of Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey. But this candle actually also represents the lives of so many women and children who have lost their lives to domestic violence every week, every year, throughout Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our condolences as a parliament, as people, have been expressed by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Australian Labor Party—so many of us—and many of us last night. And of course I express my condolences to Hannah's family, their friends and the friends of her children. But I also want to express some deep concern about some of the reporting of that event. We've all expressed our concern that domestic violence continues to happen and be a scourge on our society here in Australia, but part of dealing with that—part of combating that—also has to be that reporting of these events is clear; that reporting of these events acknowledges the important things that have happened and doesn't skirt round the gravity of actions that have been taken by people that have caused harm and, in way too many circumstances, death. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner in Australia. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. One in five Australian women have experienced sexual violence. One in four Australian women have experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. Australian women are nearly three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner and they are nearly four times more likely than men to be hospitalised after being assaulted by a spouse or partner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The litany of statistics, unfortunately, goes on and on—I have over a page of them. I encourage all people to look at the Our Watch website and view those statistics, because they are truly troubling. In particular, last year, 61 women died through domestic violence. This year already nine have died. And refuges across the country commonly tell us that, for every woman and family that they are able to help, two, three or four are turned away. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the electorate of Burt in the south-eastern suburbs of Perth, we have the highest rates of domestic violence in the metropolitan area. In the Armadale policing district, in the decade to last year, we saw family assaults increase from 746 to 1,899—that's a 154 per cent increase. Threatening behaviour against a family member increased from 66 to 367—a 4.5 time increase. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I had the honour of becoming a lawyer, one of the things that I took on was joining the board of Starick services. Starick is a domestic violence service operating in the south-eastern suburbs of Perth. I had the great honour of being the chair of that organisation for some time and also representing it on an industry representative group to government. Starick provides two refuges in our south-eastern suburbs. It provides outreach services. It provides services in police stations and it provides assistance to victims of domestic violence in courts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read the story of one of the women that Starick has assisted. This is Anne's story:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When I first got married, I thought that I was going to have a wonderful life and fulfil all the dreams a newlywed could hope for. As an A-grade student throughout high school, I went on to run my own business, had just planned an around-the-world trip and was excited about life and the prospect of sharing that life with another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I thought I'd met a man who was handsome, adventurous and brave but, instead, I was introduced to a crazy world that I could never have imagined or prepared myself for. I had no idea the transformation that was to follow over the next 14 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I didn't understand that domestic violence is like a little microscopic worm that sneaks into your mind and slowly kills you from the inside. You do not realise you are dying until it is almost too late, or someone comes and rescues you from an early grave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I always thought the worm would look like a big, unkempt, nasty, thug that swore and punched holes in the walls but instead it was quiet and cunning and deadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I never fully understood the danger I was in until after I got out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It started with my partner being disgruntled and a little bit unpredictable. He was not considerate and he was a fraction selfish. I thought this was nothing unusual. After all, newlyweds have their settling in period and I was sure I had a few things he didn't like, either. I decided to just try a little harder to be a better wife.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Well, to him being a better wife meant I should really spend less time with my friends, give up my business and be a stay-at-home mum. He said that most women would be envious of that privilege, and not to worry about my family too much since they clearly didn't understand what being a good wife was. After all, he said, they were divorced, so what would they know about how to overcome marital issues? He wanted me to sell my car because he said we needed only one and it was better for us financially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Slowly but surely the worm continued to eat away at my common sense and freedom until one day, many years later, I had given him my $30,000 of savings, completely cut off all of my family and friends, attempted suicide and let him kill all my beloved pets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">He had sexually abused my daughter, groomed the others, smashed down every door in the house, made me miscarry, beat me up more times than I can remember, threatened to kill us all and stole the beautiful vivacious girl I once was from within me. I never laughed. I never smiled. I was a dead woman walking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But still I wouldn't have labelled myself one of 'those women' who experience domestic violence. How can a normal, healthy, happy girl be reduced to a shadow of a person and not see anything wrong? Because the worm was eating me away. With each bite, it was making itself bigger and stronger and I was getting smaller and weaker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eventually, to my horror the authorities stepped in. What for, I thought? I'm a good wife. I'm looking after my kids. I don't drink or take drugs or live like a vagabond. I'm married. I'm a good person. I had NO IDEA that all the life had been sucked out of me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But, fortunately for me, it was the first time a law was passed that enabled a magistrate to take out a Violence Restraining Order WITHOUT my permission, on my husband, to protect us all from this unreasonable and unpredictable man.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many other stories like that. It is just but one of the compelling stories that I can tell from my electorate. But, as we stand and sit in this place and consider what we have seen, as we reel listening to these stories and the circumstances that we have seen reported in the news, it is incumbent on us to actually think about: 'What next? What can we actually do?' I think we need to remember the example in Victoria, where they held a royal commission into domestic violence. That royal commission in 2016 made 227 recommendations. One hundred and forty-three of those recommendations have already been implemented. I reference this not because I think we should have another royal commission; I reference this because there are now 227 things that every other state and the Commonwealth can think about doing, that we should be actually turning our minds to and making sure are implemented across this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my observation, from my work in this field and from looking at the recommendations of the royal commission, there are a few things that this parliament, this government, any federal government and any state government can look at doing. We need more refuges. We need more places in refuges. We need more refuges that can support families, not just individuals. We need more places in refuges that can support families and their pets. But we need more of them. We need more funding for those services. We can't just be funding the buildings. We need to assist in funding the services and expanding the services. It's not just about accommodation and homelessness, though that is exceptionally real; it's about the legal assistance services, the counselling services, the empowerment, the support in court and the support with police stations. We also need much more transitional housing, because it doesn't matter how many refuges we build if there's no place for people to go to then take their life back. They get full very quickly. We need more transitional housing. We also need more social housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things are things that the federal government, a federal parliament, can be involved in funding. I'm not absolving the states of any responsibility in this, but this needs to be done together. We need to be doing it now. We've talked about it for too long. We also need governments to provide certainty in funding. Too often we have seen here funding that is announced for several years—and that is commendable—and then it is left to the absolute death knell or, in fact, after that funding has run out for governments to confirm only a one-year extension to that funding or program, or yet again another pilot not followed by ongoing funding, despite the proven efficacy of those programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side we have called for a national domestic violence summit. I think that is an important start. It's an important start because coordination at a state and federal level is absolutely necessary. We have seen some work on this in terms of the application of restraining orders crossing borders. Too often we see that, even by leaving your own state, you are not safe. But that is merely the beginning. Our state and federal governments need to work much more strongly together to ensure that there is an actual plan that picks up on all of the research, the inquiries and the royal commissions, what they've already recommended, and make sure that they become a reality. That's not because it allows us to tick a box and not because it allows us to make some great announcement but because it should allow us to look all Australians in the face and say that, as their elected representatives at a national or a state level, we are actually doing the things that will make a difference in keeping people safe; in making sure that we do not have unnecessary death, violence and emotional violence; and in making sure that people can feel safe in their own homes and that children are not traumatised by the people who are there to love them. This is something I know we are actually all committed to. I look forward to working with everyone here to make sure that this becomes an actual reality in our nation. It's for everybody that this candle represents.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  The coalition government is delivering on the promises we made to Australians when we introduced the 2019-20 budget. This government's economic plan was clear and straightforward. Firstly, we would return the budget to surplus. Secondly, we would deliver more jobs while lowering taxes, meaning that hardworking Australians keep more of what they earn. Thirdly, one of the most important aspects of the budget was guaranteeing essential services like Medicare, schools, hospitals and roads. I have said countless times in this place that it is only a coalition government that can manage the economy so that we have the money to deliver essential services that Australians rely on each and every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this government's record health funding, we have strengthened Medicare, funded more hospital services and provided more affordable medicines than ever before. Since the coalition came to office, funding for public hospital services has increased by 80 per cent in my home state of Victoria. Even better is the GP bulk-billing rate in my electorate of Chisholm. It's as high as 84 per cent. In fact, 145,605 more GP visits were bulk-billed than in Labor's last year in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivery of essential services doesn't stop at health care. We have made sure that students are ready for university, TAFE and apprenticeships by improving student outcomes through record funding for schools. As a government, we are also equipping Australians with the skills of today and tomorrow by delivering up to 80,000 apprenticeships. I'm so proud of what the government is doing in this place. I can proudly visit the 34 public schools in Chisholm knowing that we'll increase funding by 55 per cent per student over the next decade. Under this government's Local Schools Community Fund, we have been able to further support our schools—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I will just quote some examples. Avila College in Mount Waverley is able to upgrade its classroom technology. The $20,000 spent on this upgrade will make a real difference to the quality of education there. Laburnum Primary School in Blackburn and St Francis Xavier Primary School were both able to invest $20,000 to upgrade their STEM facilities. The Old Orchard Primary School in Blackburn North is able to offer a dynamic learning hub to its students. Education is one of this government's highest priorities and we will continue to invest in future generations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians work extremely hard and should be entitled to keep more of what they earn. This government legislated tax relief for low- and middle-income earners of up to $1,080 for single-income earners and $2,160 for dual-income families. This immediately eases the cost of living. The ALP went to the last election promising $387 billion of higher taxes, and these are only the planned tax increases we know of. The Labor Party promised to raise taxes on retirees, on renters, on home owners, on family businesses and, sadly, on hardworking Australians. I simply do not know how the Labor Party can face the 71,469 taxpayers in my electorate of Chisholm currently benefiting from tax relief and say they would have been better off under Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When our budget is strong our communities are strong because we are able to fund activities like the Stronger Communities Program. Helping local communities in the good work that they do is important, and something this government is proud of. Helping groups like the Blackburn Vikings basketball association replace their backboards and rings, or providing $600,000 to the Laburnum Cricket Club to upgrade their awning is important. The money this government is able to provide can make a real difference. We are able to do the small things that sometimes can go unnoticed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has delivered the first balanced budget in 11 years, and our economy is predicted to grow faster than similar developed nations—the US, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and the UK—both this year and next. This is no accident. The economic leadership shown by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer means that our nation's finances are in a better place. The community I represent in this place is better off for it. Thank you.</span>

                    </span>I am very happy to rise to speak in support of the amendment to this appropriation bill moved by the member for Brand, and I'd like to take this opportunity to place on record a Change.org petition on climate change that was started by a constituent of mine, renewable energy expert Dr Richard Finlay-Jones. The petition notes a very successful legal action that the people of the Netherlands took against their government for failing to act sufficiently on climate change and really lays bare the frustration that so many Australian people have with the inability, and perhaps the unwillingness, of this government to take any real action on climate change, leaving us as a nation in a diabolical mess, with no plan to deal with this massive global issue. If the Morrison government continues to dismiss climate change as some fringe issue driven by the so-called usual suspects, as it is often reported by government, then they are in for a very big shock. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very clear from the more than 65,000 signatories to this petition that Australians are deeply frustrated with the Morrison government's diabolical lack of action on the climate emergency facing our planet. I share this frustration. It is unforgiveable that the Liberals have continually refused to act on the warnings of scientists about the dire impacts of climate change, especially in the face of this summer's unprecedented and catastrophic fire season. It won't surprise you to learn that Australia, under the Liberals, scored zero out of 100 for climate policy in the global 2020 Climate Change Performance Index, making us the worst performing nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Action on climate change isn't a sideline policy issue for many Australians anymore. It's the main game, and so it should be. Climate change is real. Australians can see it, they can smell it, and they feel it. And it's time for this government to take heed. To this end, I will be writing to the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, on behalf of the 65,000 Australians who signed this petition, to convey their profound dismay at his handling of this existential climate emergency. I will alert him to the petition and ask him to provide a written response to me that responds to the grave and urgent issues raised in the petition. I will forward any update to the signatories to the petition when I receive the Prime Minister's response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to draw attention to a growing issue amongst my constituents that are living in the western part of my electorate in Newcastle. Newcastle's western suburbs are a rapidly growing area, but residents know that postal services are simply not keeping pace. The closest post office for residents living in Minmi, Maryland and Fletcher is at Wallsend, which is a long way for residents to travel if they rely on public transport or, indeed, have any mobility issues. Meanwhile, Wallsend residents are seeing queues at their local post office continue to grow and grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early this month, I called for community feedback on the adequacy of the local postal services and held community offices in Maryland, Minmi and Fletcher on the issue. I was amazed at the number of people who turned out, notwithstanding the searing heat of 44.5 degrees on the day, to back in a community proposal and campaign for a new post office. Indeed, dozens of people came to tell me that, while they loved living in Maryland, Minmi and Fletcher, the lack of a post office was a real drawback. Last year I wrote to the minister about this issue when I first became aware of it. I'm pleased to report that I've now received the minister's response. In it, he confirmed that, as a result of my letter, Australia Post investigated the issue in January and decided that, while the growth is strong, it doesn't justify a new post office yet. Well, I respectfully disagree. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news, however, is that the minister also said in his letter that Australia Post has advised that they will keep the issue under review and undertake another assessment later this year. I think this provides an opportunity for the community to let Australia Post, and indeed the Morrison government, know just how much support a new post office has and how necessary it is for these dynamic and growing suburbs in the western part of my electorate. This is why I've established a petition on my website and started a local campaign. I will soon be writing to every person in the local area to encourage them to join the call for a new post office, which western suburb residents so rightly deserve. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Newcastle earthquake in 1989 stands as one of the darkest days in history for my community of Newcastle. It left property destroyed and lives shattered. At the time, the community banded together to help others by contributing to what was then called the Newcastle Lord Mayor's Earthquake Appeal Fund to pay for injuries and property damage caused by the earthquake. Recently, there have been some reports that the directors of this fund, which has now been rebadged as the Newcastle Region Natural Disaster Relief Fund, now plan to shut it down and transfer the remaining money to another charity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The news of the fund's planned closure has dismayed one person in my electorate who still lives with the scars from that terrible day. That person is Jennifer Matthews. Recently, I met with Jennifer and her family. They described to me their confusion and anger at learning that $1 million of the fund had gone unspent despite there being no way for anyone who was hurt in the earthquake, or in any other natural disaster since then, to apply for that money since 1994. Ms Matthews was at pains to tell me that she wasn't just speaking out for herself and her family but wanted to see justice for other survivors in our community who may still be suffering from the impacts of the earthquake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sympathy with the argument that the fund should not be wound up while survivors like Ms Matthews still suffer from damage inflicted on that day. People donated in good faith to a fund for a very specific purpose. Surely, that purpose is what it should be used for. I can also see that there is a strong imperative for the trustees of this donated money to actively seek out potential beneficiaries across our community before closing the fund down. I am particularly disappointed that the remaining funds seem to have been inaccessible to survivors since the disaster relief fund was formed in 1994.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hate to think that some Novocastrians may have died without getting the support they might have been entitled to access. Accordingly, I have written to the minister who has responsibility for charities—a senator from the other place. I have requested that the minister investigate the history of the actions of these funds and report back on whether they have complied with both the law and their own constitutions. I have asked the minister to advise whether there are any avenues for individuals to challenge the fund's closure or the manner in which the funds are disbursed. Today I call on the minister to fast-track this process and launch a formal investigation into the Newcastle Lord Mayor's Earthquake Appeal Fund and the Newcastle Region Natural Disaster Relief Fund so that people like Jennifer and her family are not kept waiting any longer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, the Joint Select Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme, of which I am deputy chair, held a hearing with Department of Social Services which revealed some deeply concerning information. The redress scheme has been fraught with problems: it has been slow, it has been confusing, it has been unresponsive. Indeed, at the current rate of payments being made, it would take 92 years for the government to deliver the redress if it were to reach the estimated 60,000 survivors. Today we have learned that the government has utterly failed to fix the massive issue of organisations not signing up to participate in the scheme. Indeed, we learned from the public evidence given that there are a staggering 280 organisations with active claims against them who have not yet signed up to the National Redress Scheme. Five hundred and forty-five survivors have pending applications relating to those organisations. They are 545 people who cannot move forward. The organisations had a duty of care to those people, who had horrendous crimes committed against them. There was an absolute betrayal of trust. They can't move forward until those organisations sign up to the scheme. They're stuck in limbo and the risk of retraumatisation for them is very, very real. This is a totally unacceptable situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has known about the deadline facing the organisations. It's less than four months away until all of those organisations have to be signed up. The government has known about that deadline for 18 months, yet the plan to ensure that all of those 280 organisations are signed up is very unclear. The time for asking nicely has long passed. The National Redress Scheme will fail survivors and their loved ones if this issue is not resolved. We put recommendations to the government in the last parliament that provided a pathway forward. The government needs to act on the advice that has been provided to it in order to get the organisations to sign up now.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one lever the Commonwealth has at its disposal without having to go to the states and territories is that it can be very tough on the recalcitrant organisations by suspending their charitable tax concessions. That's one move it could do right now. If organisations aren't willing to fulfil their social and ethical responsibilities to this country, why should the parliament and the Australian people continue to give them lucrative tax breaks? The minister has talked tough on this, but we are yet to see any concrete evidence of how she plans to fix this mess. With only four months to go until the deadline, the clock is ticking. I put the government on high alert that I will be holding it to account at every step of the way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the remaining time I have, I would like to raise another terrible issue in my community, around payday lending. One of the most diabolical trends we've seen under this government is the hollowing out of the middle class. There is the Morrison government's abject failure to stem runaway housing prices and put a lid on climbing power bills. It has pushed so many Australians into financial dire straits. Indeed, we know that 2.1 million Australians are now under severe or high financial stress, which makes them highly vulnerable to offers of quick credit through products like payday loans or consumer leases. Then, through excessive fees and charges and interest rates of up to 400 per cent, people can quickly find themselves in an ever-expanding spiral of debt, with nowhere to escape.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and cognate bill. Today I want to talk about Tasmania and the fact that Tasmania is now known as the turnaround state. For a long time, we were the nation's cellar dwellers against almost every economic measure. The latest CommSec <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tates </span>report proves this is no longer the case. In fact, today we have the fastest-growing economy in the nation. Tasmania's revival started in 2013 and 2014 with the election of the coalition government federally and a majority of Liberal governments at the state level. Our state growth has been around 3.3 per cent in the last 12 months and that was the highest rate of growth in almost a decade. On a per capita basis we have the fastest-growing economy in the country, almost double the national average. Importantly, though, our economy is broad-based, with almost every sector growing. Retail trade has grown in 50 consecutive months. Exports are particularly strong. And there's been a positive momentum in our strong economy which has resulted in increases in tourism, business confidence, population growth and infrastructure investment throughout our state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the former Premier of Tasmania Will Hodgman. We will miss Will. He's done a fantastic job, but we look forward to Peter Gutwein's leadership. Although Tasmania only occupies two per cent of the landmass of Australia, it receives nine per cent of the rainfall within Australia. But we also have 25 per cent of Australia's fresh water in storage, and this storage is important to my story today in support of these appropriation bills. Through our Tranche 3 irrigation, our irrigation systems have proved immensely positive for the state's growth. In this time of drought, and as it hits home, access to water is priority No. 1. We in Tasmania, and I as a farmer, recognise that irrigation water is liquid gold for all Tasmanian farmers. Access to water right across our irrigation schemes is allowing farmers to diversify, to value-add and to expand their existing farming operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hodgman and Morrison governments are jointly investing $170 million into our Pipeline to Prosperity Tranche 3 irrigation system, with the Don, Sassafras and Wesley Vale projects in the electorate of Braddon progressing through the planning and approval processes which will provide liquid gold to our farmers. Feedback has been extremely positive with the Don scheme near Devonport on track for likely approvals early in 2020, with construction likely to start late next year. Local farmers have also expressed interest in exceeding 5,000 megalitres, more than triple the 1,300 meg originally proposed for the Sassafras and Wesley Vale schemes. Our Pipeline to Prosperity is providing farmers in each district with the confidence to invest in growing their businesses even further. It is estimated that, when fully implemented, Tranche 3 irrigation projects could deliver 78,000 megs of water to farmers, create 2½ thousand jobs, and increase annual on-farm production by $114 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, Tasmanian irrigation has delivered 14 projects under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2, which had the capacity to deliver approximately 100,000 megalitres of highly reliable irrigation water to Tasmanian farmers—liquid gold! And we've put the infrastructure in place to ensure this is captured. The Morrison and Gutwein governments are in lock step with our plan to grow the farmgate value of Tasmania's agricultural sector. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> I will continue with how irrigation and our liquid gold capture is improving the GDP of Tasmania and pushing it forward to being the industry leader in agriculture throughout the nation. I'm now going to talk about how we're going to get this agricultural produce to market, and that's important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in roads too. The Morrison government's $100 billion transport infrastructure investment across Australia is important and moving Australia forward. My constituents, who are driving around Braddon, are not belting along a freeway. We don't spend much time in traffic jams, but this investment and what it will do is to ensure that everyone in my area can get home safely to their loved ones. As an investment in our area, it will also improve travel times and reliability. It will also make our national highway, the Bass Highway, safe for all road users.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cooee to Wynyard Planning Study is a great example of how the federal Liberal government keeps its promises in Tasmania, particularly in my electorate of Braddon. We said we'd pay for a study to be undertaken identifying the stress on this highway, and that study's been completed and it's thorough and it will move Tasmania forward, as it will our vehicles along that system.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CATHERINE KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020. This is a third-term government with no plan to get our economy moving again. Australians want a leader, not a salesman who goes missing when things get tough. Australians want a government that invests in the infrastructure we need, not a marketing campaign that offers nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Australians want a government that takes managing our economy seriously, that delivers economic leadership and an economic plan, not one which endlessly trumpets a surplus that they might not even deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last week or so we've seen the government pretending that the weakness in the economy is somehow the product of the coronavirus outbreak or the bushfire crisis, but this is a government in their seventh year. Yes, the impact of coronavirus on the economy will be substantial—just how substantial remains to be seen—but the problem Australia is facing is that the economy, on this government's watch, was already weak before the fires and well before coronavirus. The government may pretend that everything was fine until a few months ago, but that simply does not match the facts. If everything was fine before, or if the government had an economic plan, Australia would not have faced a per capita recession, Australians would not face stagnating wage growth and our economy would be better positioned to confront the challenges that are ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have supported the government's efforts to support bushfire affected communities, and we are ready to help deal with the impacts of coronavirus. But, in reality, this is a government that is failing the test that they set for themselves. This is a government which promised a surplus in their first year and every year after that. Instead, this third-term government have delivered six deficits in a row, and they are now clearing the ground for a potential seventh. In September we will find out whether the government's much-trumpeted promise of being 'back in the black' was untrue. But there is no doubt that between now and September we will see the government continue to engage in clumsy expectation management over the budget and that they will try to spin their way out of trouble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that the government will continue their attempts to shift the blame and to do everything in their power to distract from the weakness that was evident in the economy well before the fires and well before coronavirus. Just yesterday figures were released by the ABS showing that construction was down by three per cent for the December quarter. None of us had heard of the coronavirus in December. You can't blame coronavirus for that fall in the construction figure. It is, frankly, in stark contrast to how Labor in government managed an enormous shock to the global economy during our term in office. The Prime Minister might want Australians to forget that the economy was already floundering on his watch, that growth was slowing, consumption was weak, wages were stagnant, public debt had more than doubled, household debt was at record highs and productivity and business investment were going backwards, but, when the challenges of coronavirus and the fires are gone, the structural problems for the Prime Minister's economic management are still there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister cannot use the challenge of the fires and coronavirus as an excuse to not address the longstanding challenges in our economy. Action will still be needed to get our economy back on track and to move past the stagnation that has defined the seven years of this government. This ongoing weakness is no surprise to the Prime Minister and his government. They even admitted it to themselves late last year when they belatedly came to the realisation that our nation and our economy are crying out for more investment in infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After calls from the Reserve Bank governor, senior economists, industry leaders and state governments the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister finally admitted that they and their government had got it wrong, that the economy did need extra support. After ignoring these calls for months—after denying there was a problem, after saying we were panic-mongering—the government finally faced up to reality and admitted that the economy was weak, and that one of the ways to get it back on track was to bring forward investment in infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, as is all too often the case under this government, that plan, when it was released, was less an economic plan for the future and more a political marketing strategy to get them through the next few months. First the government announced they would work with the states to bring forward infrastructure spending, but then they wouldn't tell anyone what some of those projects might be. They were more concerned with the initial headline than they were with the actual program. It was more than three months after the Prime Minister wrote to the states and territories flagging that he was finally open to fast-tracking infrastructure investment that the first fast-tracked projects were finally announced. It was a long delay, but, frankly, under this government that is the norm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Next the government, in their December Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook update, announced proudly that there would be additional spending in the Infrastructure Investment Program brought forward this year. According to MYEFO this funding was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to accelerate critical infrastructure projects across Australia to drive jobs, strengthen the economy and get people home sooner and safer…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, it is exactly what Labor, the RBA, leading economists and industry groups had been calling for for months: to invest in infrastructure, to inject stimulus into the economy now and to get the economy back on track. But a quick analysis shows that the money in MYEFO was in fact not all there. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for infrastructure, were about $50 million short. Their budget update for this year was $50 million short for infrastructure investment. Producing a budget update that is out by tens of millions of dollars quite frankly speaks volumes about the Prime Minister and his capacities on the infrastructure spend in the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, when faced with questions from a journalist, officials from the Deputy Prime Minister's department claimed there was no shortfall, and said funding for government advertising, freight subsidies, management of drones, community projects and external territories form a part of this bringing forward of infrastructure, the Infrastructure Investment Program. In other words, it's actually the usual business of the department. It's not any stimulus; it's what the department usually does. So they were $50 million short. When faced with a floundering economy and a clear guide on how to deal with it, the Prime Minister again came up with something that was really nothing more than a marketing document. This MYEFO update was sold by the government as a plan to play catch-up on infrastructure funding, but the figures used did not actually add up. It is well past time that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister developed a real plan for infrastructure to actually support jobs, boost productivity and improve road safety. It isn't good enough for Australia to turn around our struggling economy; the government has to actually do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course over the past week we've seen another prime example of the way in which this government deals with infrastructure funding. I am again talking about the Urban Congestion Fund—or 'road rorts'. Not content with rorting sports grants to benefit themselves politically, the government have also decided to rort infrastructure spending as well. The Urban Congestion Fund was announced in the 2018 budget, a full year before the 2019 election. In the 2018 budget, the Urban Congestion Fund is announced. For that year, the Urban Congestion Fund sat unused—all $3 billion of it. For a whole year—a whole year!—while people were stuck in traffic in communities across the country, this fund sat there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently for the 2018-19 financial year there was no need to bust congestion. The government in that year saw no need to get people home from work faster, to improve roads and to ensure we could spend more time with our families and less time sitting in traffic for that whole year. For that year, the Morrison government did not bother to release any guidelines for this fund. They did not bother to open expressions of interest. They didn't write to the state governments. They didn't write to motoring groups and ask them what their views were about where congestion was across the country. They didn't ask local members of parliament—although we don't know what they did on that side; they certainly didn't ask any on our side. The member for Moreton very brightly wrote about a congestion project, not in relation to this fund—we all write to ministers outlining problems in our constituencies—and well done to the member for Moreton. But there was nothing, absolutely nothing. Even during that year, they must only have noticed the traffic jams in Liberal seats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Urban Congestion Fund was a $3 billion scheme, and 83 per cent of it went to Liberal seats and seats targeted by the coalition at the last election. Seventy per cent of it went to Liberal seats alone. The National Party didn't get a look-in on this one. That's unusual, I would have to say. Of the 160 projects across the country funded under the scheme, 144—more than $2.5 billion worth—went to Liberal and target seats. The Prime Minister made promises in every single urban Liberal seat that was marginal or under threat. More than one-quarter of the $3 billion was funnelled to just four Liberal seats.</span>

                    </a>  So absolutely generous of you, Member for Dawson! More than one-quarter of the $3 billion was funnelled to just four Liberal seats: Higgins, Deakin, La Trobe and Boothby. The urban commitments even extended to the regional seats of Corangamite, Robertson, Fisher and Bass, all either held or targeted by the Liberal Party. They are pretty sensitive about this because they know, once the Australian National Audit Office has a look at this program, sports rorts will pale compared to what they've done with this one. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, 23 urban Labor seats and 13 regional city Labor seats missed out absolutely completely. On so many occasions, the relevant state governments or local councils didn't even know that the commitment was being made. Those in non-government seats did get some of the money spent on them; however, it's just that it came in the form of $17 million worth of taxpayer funded advertising telling us how good this program was. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Road congestion in our major cities is set to double over the next decade, but, rather than addressing that with a solid plan consistently looking at where road congestion is across the country, the government have only been guided by what would assist them most electorally. This is a $3 billion program. We talked about $100 million with sports rorts and $150 million with sports rorts 2. This is a $3 billion government program.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  John Howard described the family as the stabilising and cohering unit of our society. He devoted so much of his government's energy into supporting Australian families to be resilient. His strength in supporting families helped to shape my commitment to serving my area and the families that live within the leafy western suburbs of Brisbane. I spoke about it a fair bit in my maiden speech in this place. I continue to devote much of my time to supporting the over 39,000 families of the Ryan electorate. It is with this in mind that I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and the related bill, to continue to outline what the government is doing to support hardworking Australian families that are pushing this country forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the government's sensible, economic management, we are able to give back to those hardworking Australian families. We are working, as a government, together to deliver more jobs. We're backing small business; building infrastructure; lowering energy costs; funding record investments in schools and hospitals; providing for more accessible and affordable child care; greater flexibility when it comes to paid parental leave; and increasing measures to help keep our kids safe online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I'd like to take the opportunity to speak about a few of these investments today and the positive impact they are having on Australian families and the families of the Ryan electorate. I mentioned before that Australian families are working incredibly hard, and we want them to be rewarded for that hard work. We want them to keep more of what they earn so that they can set their own spending priorities for their own families. So we're making income taxes lower, fairer and simpler.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2018-19, around 4.5 million Australians have been receiving tax relief of $1,080 per year. That is up to $2,160 for a dual-income family. Overall, 10 million taxpayers are benefiting from lower taxes because of this government and its strong economic management. By the time our full tax relief plan is implemented, 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30c in the dollar. In my electorate of Ryan, this means that 72,083 taxpayers will benefit from tax relief as a result of this government's enhanced Personal Income Tax Plan with 26,102 receiving the full tax offset. Because, unlike Labor, who when they run out of money come after yours, we want to give Australians the chance to keep more of what they earn and set their own spending priorities.</span>

First of all, they don't want to hear about how this government is passionately defending Australian families, how we are passionately supporting them, because Labor failed so considerably while in government and in opposition to support Australian families. What they wanted to do to the families of Australia, particularly last May, was burden them with $387 billion worth of new taxes, rather than the tax cuts that I've been talking about that this government has delivered—and they continue to want that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their hypocrisy continues to know no bounds, because we had the member for Ballarat stand up just before and criticise the $100 billion pipeline that this government is delivering to get people home to their families sooner and safer. When in government, she presided over what can only be described as a grants rort. When Labor was in government, when she was a minister, she had a grants program where more than a quarter of all projects funded were not actually recommended. As minister she made 34 decisions that diverged from the recommendations of the panel. In fact, it goes further. Despite the hypocrisy of the member for Ballarat's last speech, under her watch, 64 per cent of the 'not recommended' projects that she ended up adopting under ministerial discretion were in Labor-held seats. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> The Morrison government are intent on making sure that we support Australians and Australian families with our strong economic management in a way that Labor could never hope to do simply because they can't manage money, they can't manage the money of Australians, and when you can't do that then then you can't deliver things like record funding for schools and hospitals— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  I rise to speak to these two bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020, which seek to appropriate additional funding for the 2019-20 financial year, as reflected in the 2019-20 MYEFO, as well as bushfire related initiatives announced after the 2019-20 MYEFO was handed down. I support the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. As indicated by the shadow Treasurer, the Labor Party will support these appropriation bills because we do not block supply, but let's be clear: this isn't a tick for the government when it comes to their handling of the economy or the budget. After six years of the Liberals and Nationals, the economy is floundering and Australians are struggling, but the Morrison government has no plan to boost wages or grow the economy. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer shouldn't be using the fires and the coronavirus as an excuse for their longstanding failures on the economy. The economy was weak before the fires and before the virus hit. Growth had already slowed since the election and had almost halved since the Prime Minister and the Treasurer took over in 2018. Net debt has more than doubled under the government's watch and gross debt is well over half a trillion dollars—record highs. In 2013, when the government came to office, gross debt was $257 billion; in 2019, it was $542 billion; and it has been over $500 billion since 2017—well over 40 per cent of GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we recognise the impacts of the bushfires and coronavirus, in terms of physical, psychological and economic impacts, but economic growth and wages growth were downgraded before the impact of the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak. Almost two million Australians were looking for work or more work before the impact of the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak. In January this year, the youth unemployment rate rose to 12.1 per cent from 11.6 per cent in December. There are a whopping 270,000 young people unemployed. Wages growth has been stuck at or around record lows for the last few years under the Liberals—around two per cent, on average, in the private sector nationally—and low wages and low growth mean that people and businesses don't spend and the economy loses momentum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Living costs for families are rising way too fast. Recent data shows that childcare costs have increased by 35 per cent since 2013—around six per cent a year, on average. The much-heralded childcare reforms of 2018 have been neutralised by spiralling fee increases and out-of-pocket medical costs have skyrocketed. In Corangamite, locals pay $36 in out-of-pocket expenses to visit a GP and $59 in addition to the rebate to see a specialist. Thousands of young people are dropping out of private health insurance. That area is in crisis, with no solution in sight. Because of the government's failures, we have to meet the challenges and uncertainties of the bushfires and the coronavirus from a position of weakness, not strength.</span>

                    </a>  My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Prime Minister poured over 83 per cent of the $3 billion allocated from the Urban Congestion Fund into Liberal seats and seats targeted by the Liberal Party. In the lead-up to the 2019 election, the Prime Minister funnelled 144 of 160 projects into Liberal and targeted seats—more than $2.5 billion. He made promises in every single urban Liberal seat that was marginal or under threat. More than one quarter of the $3 billion was funnelled to just four Liberal seats: Higgins, Deakin, La Trobe and Boothby. This is rorting on a nuclear scale. The Prime Minister has misused public money to promote his political interests. He spends public money to buy elections, not to meet community needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about vocational education. As we learnt last year from the federal education department's own data, the government have failed to spend almost $1 billion of their TAFE and training budget over the past five years, and all of this underspend is additional to the more than $3 billion already ripped out of the VET system. We've got TAFE campuses falling apart across the country, we've got state governments closing campuses and ending courses, and, all the while, a huge pile of money remains unspent. Employer groups across the country are complaining about skill shortages across almost every sector. The Australian Industry Group states that 75 per cent of employers report an inability to attract skilled workers. Under the coalition, there are almost 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than there were in 2013. That means a shortage of workers in critical trades and services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Corangamite, there are 113, or 7.7 per cent, fewer trainees and apprentices today than there were in 2013. In the Minister for Education's own seat of Wannon, there are 1,044, or around 28 per cent, fewer apprentices or trainees than in 2013. If the coalition government can't train skilled workers, they can't build a skilled economy and they can't build the infrastructure of the future or support emerging new industries. Right now, they are failing miserably. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the NDIS. The NDIS should be a fantastic scheme. It has already helped many people, compared to the fragmented system we had before 2013. But the NDIS is suffering from slow strangulation by a National Disability Insurance Agency aided and abetted by the Morrison government. Last year, to prop up their dodgy budget surplus, the government sucked $1.6 billion out of the expected expenditure of the NDIS. The excuse given was that the demand simply wasn't there—that, if there had been the demand, then the money would have been available. What rubbish! There are hundreds of stories of the NDIA clawing back money from vulnerable participants. Usually the local area coordinator does the right thing and recommends what the medical and allied health experts say is required, but, after the proposal goes up the line to the NDIA, the plan usually comes back with cuts and deletions. Let me quote a constituent of mine, Trevor Ah Hang, of Portarlington, who wrote to me only last week: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I submitted a plan in October 2019. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It returned with significant cuts … The Coordinator submitted an appeal stating that the Transport funding was crucial as my Carer had developed Parkinsons, meaning I couldn't rely on her always being available to take me to appointments. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As for funding for group activities, NDIA had asked for progress reports from all parties engaged in the previous plan. Without exception they stated the progress gained over that year and how it was crucial to continue. So why ask for these details if someone is just going to say "Nuh!" and put a line through an item number with no explanation? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In late November I received a letter from the NDIS stating that they'd received an appeal on my behalf dated October 23, 2019 and informing me that under their guidelines they had three months to address the situation or notify me why they couldn't … that was over four months ago and I've heard NOTHING! No answer, no information, NOTHING. I've contacted them several times and the answer is always "the matter is before a delegate." </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm at my wits end and have even told my therapist I'd rather be dead than dependant on the NDIS.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trevor and thousands like him shouldn't have to go through this frustration. The NDIA should listen to the experts. Last December, the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS, of which I'm a member, put forward some bipartisan and practical recommendations to improve the planning process. The government should adopt them all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention Neil Radley and the 6,000 younger Australians just like him who live in aged-care facilities simply because they have nowhere else to go. Neil came to see me last year here in parliament. Neil is in his 50s and became an quadriplegic a decade ago. He wants to live independently, in his own unit or house in the community. It's a reasonable proposition. The interim report of the royal commission into aged care has shamed the government into making a commitment that no person under 65 who wants to live independently will live in a nursing home beyond 2025. But how will they deliver on this promise? To date, only about 250 of the 6,000 younger people in nursing homes have been approved for disability accommodation. The hurdles and the paperwork make the application process torturous, and Neil admitted to me that he almost gave up. But, having gained SDA approval, Neil now finds that no investor in Bendigo will build disability housing. The NDIA says, 'That's not our problem.' This is how the government is able to say there is no demand and take $1.6 billion away from people with disability. Well, it should be the problem of the NDIA and it should be the problem of this government. They should be intervening and investing directly in disability housing, rather than allowing market failure to deny vulnerable Australians a decent future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now let's talk about climate change. Climate change is real. Australians have been able to see it, feel it and smell it all summer. The Prime Minister is unable to act on climate change because he is held hostage by hardline conservatives who think they know better than the world's scientists, and who don't even believe that climate change is real.

                    </a>  My apologies. The Prime Minister has no plan to invigorate the economy by developing new technologies and new fuels. I note that both Japan and Korea have made hydrogen the centrepiece of their future energy strategies. Australia could develop an export industry to replace fossil fuels, which are quickly becoming redundant. Investment in large-scale renewables has fallen off a cliff since last year—a drop of 60 per cent—because this government keeps attacking renewables and will not provide policy certainty in the investment community. Instead, the Neanderthals within the coalition have given $4 million for a feasibility study into wasteful and expensive coal-fired power at Collinsville.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only Labor will ensure that by 2050 the amount of pollution we release into the atmosphere will be no greater than the amount we absorb. Labor will not rely on Kyoto carryover credits to achieve this target.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have no doubt that intermittent renewables could meet 100% of Australia's electricity requirements by the 2030s, with high degrees of security and reliability, and at wholesale prices much lower than experienced in Australia over the past half dozen years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Garnaut says that the innovation and momentum released by the adoption of renewable technologies will set our economy up for the next century. New coal-fired power will push up power prices and make businesses less competitive. The electricity industry and investors have been crystal clear: they won't invest in new coal-fired power. Australia's energy future lies in renewable energy, because it's by far the cheapest form of electricity generation and because it helps in the fight against climate change. A target of net zero emissions by 2050 is supported by everyone. Every major business group, every state and territory government, and other major corporations all support this target—and still the coalition refuses to shift course. The real question is not what it will cost to address climate change but what the cost of inaction is. This is the question the Prime Minister won't answer. The cost of not acting is more important—and we've seen the frequent natural disasters, such as the recent bushfires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these appropriation bills, we are paying a premium to rebuild our communities and support Australians affected by these events—events that are induced or exacerbated by climate change. And we'll continue to pay that premium for years to come, unless we act on climate change. The cost of not acting is a decline in global economic output of between 15 and 25 per cent. That's a bigger hit to the global economy than the Great Depression. If we don't meet the obligations of the Paris Agreement, it will cost the Australian economy as much as $2.7 billion to 2050. That's 20 times more than the cost of taking action. The CSIRO says a carbon-neutral Australia by 2050 is one where wages are 35 per cent higher than in a future Australia where we do nothing. This government fiddles while we watch the nation burn. Labor will support these bills, but we give a huge fail to the government on so many aspects of their economic and budget management.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020. I'm here to talk about my community—and I hope I get a full 15 minutes before those opposite decide to shut down debate again and waste more of Australian taxpayers' money. I talk about the community spirit in Lindsay, and for good reason. We in this place are here to represent our communities, and work hard to deliver the best possible opportunities. We want to ensure that people can live, work and stay in Lindsay. That's why we are creating local jobs for local people. We don't want people to have to leave our community for jobs or education opportunities. We want the best of the best, right in my community of Lindsay. A big part of that is making sure that people can get around faster and more safely—whether it's getting to work, getting the kids to school or doing the commute home. I am very passionate about ensuring that people don't have to do that long commute to and from work, like I did for 10 years, for a good job. Part of this is around ensuring that we ease congestion on our local roads, because it's such a problem for many local people. Accessing car parks to catch a train or bus and commute to work each day is an issue many people face, and that's why the Morrison government is investing in more commuter car parking at Kingswood Station, north St Marys Station and Emu Plains Station. I'll be working very closely with my colleagues in the New South Wales government to deliver this much-needed infrastructure for our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our biggest investment is the $5.3 billion to fully fund the construction of the Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport and the $3.5 billion for stage 1 of the North South Rail Link, which runs in my electorate of Lindsay from St Marys to the airport and the Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis. During construction of the Western Sydney airport, over 11,300 jobs will be created, and within five years of opening 28,000 full-time jobs will be created. The great part of this is that we already have 50 per cent of employment going to local people, and this includes jobs in construction, transport, logistics, rail, hospitality and professional services. Excitingly, there's a creation of whole new industries around STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—and even a space industry right in Western Sydney. The Sydney Science Park, a $5 billion integrated science, research and residential facility just north of the airport, has recently started construction and is another example of the airport's ability to create great local jobs and deliver and drive our economy in Western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area I'm very passionate about is the health and wellbeing of people in the electorate of Lindsay. I talk about the Nepean River often because it really is the heart of the city, and even the Prime Minister has enjoyed the Nepean River, rowing there as a young child. The river is an essential part of our community, and it's important that we look after it for future generations. That's why I was proud to announce funding to keep the Nepean River healthy and to assist with removing weeds to ensure that we can all enjoy the Nepean River. It's something that's used by thousands of families weekly, and it's also where our Australian Rowing Team trains to prepare for the Olympic Games. Local organisations, such as Muru Mittigar and the Penrith and Hawkesbury river councils, will be assisting with the important work that's about to take place on the Nepean River so we can continue to enjoy it into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also committed to ensuring that we are driving our local economy and creating local jobs, delivering congestion-busting infrastructure, and delivering programs to ensure that our local people can reengage with the workforce and access the training and personal development they need for education and employment opportunities. It means employment opportunities for all members of our community. In saying this, I would like to acknowledge that Lindsay is home to nearly 6,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and it is important that we encourage our younger generation to access the best education and employment opportunities. That's why we secured funding for the Western Sydney Indigenous jobseekers program. This funding, which goes to Muru Mittigar, will connect local Indigenous students with job providers, and there's a guaranteed 154 job placements. I've often said that our community spirit in Lindsay is overflowing, and, by delivering the funding and infrastructure our local organisations need, we are making sure that our community spirit will continue to thrive. In saying this, the community hall upgrades are an important part of our local community, because this is where many of our community organisations go to deliver important services across the electorate of Lindsay. We've got four of those upgrades happening because of the Morrison government's investment in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another integral organisation is the Luke Priddis Foundation. This foundation supports children with autism and their families. Earlier this year we announced funding for the Luke Priddis Foundation digital hub to turn the foundation's offices into a hub to assist young people with ASD. We're also delivering funding for Panthers on the Prowl. This funding will be delivered over two years to fund the full suite of prowl programs. The school program will have a significant impact on children and already has helped 250 kids across the community. It is aimed at building self-esteem and social skills, and resilience and leadership, to help improve student engagement and motivation, particularly in children at risk of dropping out of school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fantastic program in our community is the St Mary's school lunch program. We've secured funding for the ongoing delivery of this program. I went out and visited Christ Mission Possible. They pack lunches for hundreds of kids each day before they go to school. In talking about the importance of ensuring that children have healthy food before going to school, one of the election commitments I made that I'm so proud of was for the Cranebrook Breakfast Club, that we work together to deliver a new 12-seater van. This breakfast club not only ensures that kids have something good to eat before going to school; it has helped to increase the attendance rates of kids at school—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I'm pleased to make a contribution on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020. First, I'd like to talk about Medicare, and the centrality of Medicare and bulk-billing to Australia. The health of all Australians must be our No. 1 priority, and the health of my community in Shortland is being threatened by changes to Medicare that came into effect last month. On 1 January this year, the Morrison government cut bulk-billing incentives to doctors in the Hunter region and 13 other regions throughout Australia, making it harder for doctors to bulk-bill, even for those who need it the most. Notices have gone up in many surgeries saying they will no longer be able to bulk-bill, while other surgeries have put up their fees. I've been inundated with calls from people telling me how worried they are, and with good reason. I don't blame the doctors for this. This cut is simply the latest in a long list of cuts to Medicare by Liberal governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Shortland already has low bulk-billing rates. Fewer than 60 per cent of people are routinely bulk-billed, meaning two in five people in Shortland have to pay every time they see the doctor. Let me repeat that: two in five people in Shortland already have to pay to see the doctor. And, when they do pay, they are $37 on average out of pocket for every visit—an increase of 38 per cent since 2013. That's well in excess of inflation. And for specialist visits it's even worse: fewer than one in five people are routinely bulk-billed to see specialists in Shortland, meaning four out of five people are out of pocket to the tune of, on average, $80 every visit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This cut to Medicare bulk-billing incentives will only make matters worse. Unfortunately, the lower Hunter combines some of the lowest bulk-billing rates with some of the highest rates of disadvantage in the nation. Windale and Mount Hutton are amongst the most disadvantaged communities in Australia with particularly high levels of children living in poverty. People living in these communities cannot afford to pay to see the doctor. Others who already pay to see the doctor cannot afford to pay more. When people can't afford to go to the doctor, they do one of two things: they either stay at home and put up with whatever is ailing them, making things worse in the long run; or they go to hospital—and we all know how busy and overstretched emergency rooms are. This does not even make economic sense as it costs far more for our health services to treat a very sick person in emergency than to treat a sick person in a doctor's surgery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw evidence to a Senate committee during the GP tax debate which found that, if only one in 50 people who were deterred from seeing a doctor because of the GP tax then presented to the emergency department, the entire savings from the GP tax would be wiped out. I've no doubt that this is what will occur again. People will not go to a doctor, because of the cost increases brought on by this government. They will get sicker and they will have no choice but to present to the ED ward at Belmont Hospital or John Hunter. That will cost the taxpayers of Australia much, much more and it imperils the health of those individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are raising their concerns with me daily. For example, David from Caves Beach rang my office furious that his GP at Blacksmiths will no longer be bulk-billing him and his wife. The practice will now only bulk-bill people over 70. David is a self-funded retiree who has a health care card. Previously, he and his wife were bulk-billed. It is now going to cost them $65 to visit the doctor, and they go at least three times a month. It will have a huge impact on their budget. It's something those opposite haven't considered, despite all their professed love for self-funded retirees. Gordon rang to say the skin cancer clinic he attends at Belmont will no longer bulk-bill for surgical procedures. He is about to have a procedure for which he was bulk-billed last year, but this year he'll be out of pocket a staggering $250. It's not a major procedure, he says, but it is necessary and it is a lot of money. These are just two of the many examples of hardship. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been running a petition for my constituents to sign, and they've been able to provide insightful feedback which clearly identifies the importance of bulk-billing and how much Australians care about universal health care. Peter from Jewells wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you have an ongoing health problem it becomes a huge problem if you have to go to your doctor and he no longer bulk bills. If you cannot afford to go to your own doctor and you decide to go to the hospital you are told that you should have gone to your own doctor because the hospital is already overloaded. </span>

Under the Shortland Communities Environment Program, five groups have shared in $73,000 to continue their environmental work, and I look forward to the program being refined to make it a lot more accessible if the government chooses to continue it. Under the Shortland Local Schools Community Fund, 12 schools have shared in $200,000 to improve the education and wellbeing of their students. The projects are interesting and varied and spread throughout the electorate, from Cardiff in the north to Buff Point in the south. </span>

San Remo's Men's Shed will install a dust extractor for the safer use of woodworking machines. Novocastrian Swim Club will install an all-weather area for dryland training, socialisation and presentations. Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club will fence off a secure area to store and maintain board and ski trailers.

Northlakes High in San Remo will install fitness equipment. Cardiff High and Blacksmiths primary will upgrade technology to their school halls. Windale, Caves Beach and Charlestown East public schools will improve their playgrounds. Dudley and Nords Wharf public schools will install new bubblers and water bottle refilling stations. St Brendan's Catholic Primary School, Lake Munmorah, will develop a play area and sensory garden for students with disabilities. St Francis Xavier Primary, Belmont, will invest in Lego educational robots for computer programming classes. I had a great visit to SFX last week, and I look forward to coming back so the kids can teach me all about these Lego educational robots.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I want to talk about a couple of portfolio issues. As the shadow minister for international development and the Pacific, it's an intense privilege to develop policies to support people throughout this world—because, ultimately, to state the blindingly obvious, we are all humans and we all have an obligation to advance human welfare wherever we find it. That's why it saddens me so deeply to remind the parliament of the $11.8 billion of cuts this government has imposed on our official development assistance budget. This cut not only undermines the soft power of Australia, not only undermines our ability to influence other nations; it costs human lives. I don't say that lightly. These budget cuts kill people. They literally kill people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing three things. We're seeing the budget cuts. We're seeing diversion of resources to the Pacific step-up. And the Pacific step-up is a worthy initiative, which we support. We've got some views on how to improve it. We support the Pacific step-up, but it should not result in a step-down everywhere else in the world. We're also seeing extreme cuts to health and education assistance, which is, as I said, costing lives. The impact of these cuts from the government—Senate figures came out highlighting this—is a cut in our official development assistance to South-East Asia of 30 per cent; cuts to assistance to South Asia of 42 per cent; cuts to assistance to Africa of 49 per cent; cuts to assistance to Latin America of 85 per cent; and cuts to multilateral organisations of 25 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is having an extreme impact. This is hurting people. This is costing lives. And it is actually impacting on national security. For example, by the end of this year we will not provide a cent of bilateral assistance to Pakistan, the centre of Islamic extremism in the world. This is a very short-sighted approach. The cuts are hurting nearer to home. For example, we had a visit by the President of Indonesia a couple of weeks ago. It would have been useful to highlight during his visit that Australia has cut its overseas development assistance to Indonesia in half. The cuts to health assistance for Indonesia were a massive 86 per cent, and there were cuts to education of 57 per cent. These are very, very significant. We've cut assistance to Vietnam in half. This government has cut assistance to the Philippines, Laos and Cambodia by a third. Tragically, we've cut assistance to the poorest country in the entire world, Timor-Leste, by 10 per cent in the period to 2018.</span>

                    </a>  It is disgraceful, Member for Macquarie. It is a damning indictment on this government that its policies are causing so much human misery not just in Australia but throughout the world. Cuts across all educational assistance were 41 per cent and for health were 32 per cent. Even within the Pacific region, a region that this government tries to claim it focuses on, we've seen significant cuts to individual nations. For example, assistance to Vanuatu has been cut by 42 per cent. Assistance to Samoa was cut by 14 per cent. Incredibly, health assistance to Samoa has been cut by 36 per cent. In the aftermath of a tragic and deadly measles epidemic, this government is cutting health assistance to Samoa by 36 per cent. We saw cuts to assistance to Tonga of 10 per cent, Cook Islands of 26 per cent, Tuvalu of 17 per cent, Kiribati of 9½ per cent and Fiji of 5.3 per cent. This is a government intent on destroying the overseas development assistance budget, which is incredibly short-sighted. Not only is it hurting and killing fellow human beings; it is hurting our soft power ability throughout the globe.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quickly on defence procurement, which is one of my other responsibilities in the opposition: this government continues to preside over a massive mess in defence procurement. Thirty-six projects are running a cumulative 74 years late. That's right: 36 projects have been so mismanaged by this government that they are 74 years late and $10.3 billion over budget. The latest report from Defence has found problems with the Jindalee Operational Radar Network, JORN; deployable defence air traffic management and control systems; battlefield command systems; MRH90 supply issues; problems with the Hawkeye; problems with the pilot training system; an additional two-year delay to satellites; a 3½ year delay to commando special operations vehicles; and a 1½ year delay to the Hercules upgrade. Thirty-six projects delayed 74 years with a budget blow-out of $10 billion. This means that our troops in the ADF aren't getting the equipment they need when they need it. It's a damning indictment of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'll be focused with my Labor colleagues throughout this year on holding this government to account and to fight for the best outcome for all Australians. I'll be particularly focused on fighting for outcomes in Shortland, a beautiful place to live. It's an area that continues to struggle under budget cuts from Commonwealth and state governments. I commend the bills to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2019-2020. All forms of violence against women and their children are unacceptable in any community and in any culture. All levels of government, plus business, service providers and the community, must commit to continuous action and investment to stop violence before it starts, and to support women and children where and when they need it. Ending violence against women and their children starts with promoting equality between men and women and respect for all. There is no single cause of violence against women and their children; however, gender inequality sets the stage for such violence to occur. The fourth action plan will continue to address this issue through prevention, early intervention and response, including working with those who use violence to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rates of violence against women are highly concerning. One woman is killed every nine days by a current or former partner. Rates of sexual violence increased by eight per cent across Australia between 2016 and 2017. Complex violence, such as forced marriage and abuse, continues to emerge. Such experiences can be influenced by cultural beliefs and traditions, immigration and settlement in a new country and, in some contexts, religious and cultural values. Among other factors, these crimes need to be addressed and tackled head-on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prevention is the most effective way to eliminate violence against women and their children and is at the core of the fourth action plan. Primary prevention means stopping violence before it occurs. It means changing attitudes, behaviours and accepted standards that excuse, justify or even encourage violence against women and their children. Primary prevention activities are for the whole community, not just for those who've been impacted by violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Women of all backgrounds can experience domestic and family sexual violence. No two women's experience of violence are the same. The experiences of victims and survivors can help us understand what works for them. One in three women has experienced some kind of physical violence in their lifetime—that is from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2012. One in six adult women has experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner—that compares to one in 19 men. One in four women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. Australian women are most likely to experience violence in their home at the hands of a male current or ex-partner. Thirty-six per cent of women have experienced physical or sexual abuse from someone they know. Fifteen per cent have experienced violence from an ex-partner. And for 62 per cent of the women who've had experience of physical assault by a male perpetrator, the most recent incident was in their home. Once again, that was from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestic violence is a vastly underreported crime. Of women who've experienced violence from their current or former partner, 39 per cent have never sought advice or support and 80 per cent have never contacted the police. Of women who've experienced violence by their ex-partner, 73 per cent experienced more than one incident of violence and over half had children in their care when the violence occurred. Eighty-nine women were killed by their current or former partner between 2008 and 2010. This equates to nearly one woman every week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, children and communities continue to experience high rates of violence. We must be clear that family violence is not a part of Australian culture or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. Culture and family are central, key protective factors that support Indigenous families to be free of violence. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women must be supported to make choices that will protect and promote their own and their family's long-term safety if they break the cycle of trauma and violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth action plan recognises that preventing and responding to family violence starts by recognising individual family and community strengths. Solutions to address violence must effectively engage and equip Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in decision-making processes. Service providers and governments must work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and with the community controlled organisations to develop solutions that are culturally appropriate, trauma informed, holistic and can lead to healing for families and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville—from the DV stats from the Queensland Police Service—the number of domestic violence breaches in 2019 was 466. The number of domestic violence breaches in January 2020 was 45. These are only the incidents that are caught by police. In reality, so many more cases would go completely undetected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is so much more important than just reading from a piece of paper. As a father with a daughter—and I have another daughter on the way in April—this sickens me to my stomach that these numbers and these stats are so high. I would not know how to control my emotions if something so horrible ever happened to my family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this time to acknowledge Terri Butler, the member for Griffith, for what she said last night at the candlelight vigil and the support that I know that she has given to the family of Hannah and the three children who were murdered by someone the kids called 'Dad', by a violent former partner, which is nothing but unacceptable, disgusting and disgraceful and needs to be condemned not just by people in this place but everywhere in Australia. But we must do more. We always can do more in putting supports in place for people who have experienced domestic violence. We just must work together. This is never a time to throw mud at each other, because as a nation we are mourning and weeping over the loss of Hannah and her three children. This isn't a political thing. This is a gross blight on our community which is called domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville a lady was recently stabbed by her brother and she died. These aren't isolated incidents. These are things that have happened throughout the country. With the national plan and working with people on the other side, the crossbench, the other place and states and territories, we must—we have to—link arms and work together. There is no number that is acceptable for domestic violence. No number is acceptable. Being a father really hammers this home. I look around and I see such strong women leaders in this place who give my daughter role models to look up to—regardless of where you sit, on either side. I know, and I speak for my colleagues and for the other side, that we will and must work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have zero tolerance for domestic, family and sexual violence, which is why there is $340 million committed into the fourth action plan. But money is only as good as the service it provides. Whilst there is record funding provided, it is only as good as the services on the ground. The fourth action plan includes practical actions: primary prevention is key intervention; supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children; respecting, listening and responding to the diverse lived experience and knowledge of women and their children who are affected by violence; responding to sexual violence and sexual harassment; and improving support and services system responses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 November last year, the National Implementation Plan was launched. The National Implementation Plan sets out how we will work to address national priorities of the fourth action plan and outlines the approach for monitoring and reporting on implementation. The implementation plan can be found at www.plan4womenssafety.dss.gov.au, and I think everyone here will and should be looking at and talking about it in their communities. Like I've said, like people opposite have said, there is no acceptable number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this can't be just talk. Talk with no action is just a waste of oxygen. We need to be working together, working with people who have lived experience—from rural and remote communities to people who live in the cities. I know that I'll be talking to the leaders in my community, especially in the built-up areas that have Indigenous peoples like Palm Island, to see what works for them. This isn't one size fits all; this needs to be tailored to different people's communities, but there must always be the same sentiment that there is no acceptable number for domestic violence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night at the candlelight vigil—I can't even describe the emotions we all had, but I never want to do it again. I never want to stand at another candlelight vigil for people who have died, who have been killed through domestic violence. I do not want to stand at a candlelight vigil and hear that children called this—I'm not allowed to swear in here—disgusting human 'dad', hear that he could do such a despicable thing. And Hannah left him, as we heard last night. She had left to seek help, to seek refuge. She was brave, she was strong. So for this to still happen makes everyone sick to the stomach. I encourage anyone who watches this—if you're in this position, if you are suffering domestic violence—to please get help. Please speak to the police, speak to your friends, speak your family, speak to everyone, because this just is not acceptable anywhere in the world. There's not much more I can really say on it. It just really kicks you in the guts. I didn't know Hannah or her three kids, but it has affected the whole nation. We need to be doing more. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I just want to say a grateful thanks to the previous speaker, the member for Herbert, for that contribution on this critically important matter. Sometimes when things go sour in this chamber—one of the things I find really upsetting is when people start pointing fingers and saying that one side of politics cares about a problem like domestic violence more than the other. I could really hear the emotion in the member for Herbert's voice. We share that emotion, and it's really important that we use this as a moment of change for this conversation. Hannah Clarke's murder absolutely captured the attention of the country, and that's an important thing. Women like Hannah are killed every week in Australia and we need to do better. And there are things we can do. Isn't it frustrating: there are things we can fix about this problem, and we have the power to do it, so I really do hope that there's a big change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also great to hear that strength of resolve about these issues coming from men. Of course, men have always spoken out about this, but it's really critical because we have to make it clear that men can't behave this way. Men are really important carriers of that message, and we see that through some of the great work being done by White Ribbon ambassadors. I also want to thank the member for Herbert for acknowledging the member for Griffith, who I know has had a really important role representing her community in this discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn now to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2019-2020 that is before the House at the moment. It comes at a pretty critical time for the country. This summer has been a very difficult one for many Australians. The country has been burning. Since we finished sitting last December, we've had catastrophic fires which have destroyed hundreds of homes. Thirty-three people died and a billion animals perished in the flames around the country. We've had forests and ecologies destroyed that will never grow back and support the animals that they did before. And it has not just been the fires, of course. We've had floods. We've had torrential rains. We've had this horrible smoke haze that has come over some of the major cities. It certainly affected the city of Melbourne, where I come from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time we've had literally millions of Australians experience the beginnings of what inaction on climate change is going to look like. Now, it's really critical for us to understand that the sorts of things that happened over the summer are occurring when we've had a single degree of global warming caused by humans. What we are looking at, unless we take very significant action, is three to four degrees of global warming—some scientists are now saying we're looking at five degrees of global warming—by 2100. Every piece of expert evidence we have tells us that in that environment we are going to be seeing catastrophes happen all over the world—countries will literally be experiencing inundation constantly; potentially hundreds of millions of people in our region will literally be displaced by climate change and its impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spent a lot of time talking to my community about this problem since we left here in December, and the consistent message that I'm getting from almost everyone I speak to is this: something has to change. We just cannot go on like this. We cannot go on like this with all the extraordinary damage that can be done to our beautiful country and not take the proper response so that we can go to these global forms around the world, which have the power to actually reshape this problem, and make a credible argument that more needs to be done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've returned here for the New Year and Labor have done the responsible thing: we've made the commitment to get to zero net emissions by 2050. The reaction to this tells me one thing: it is a confirmation of how completely broken climate politics is in this country. This is not a radical proposal; this is not anywhere near a radical proposal; in fact, it is a no-brainer of Australian public policy. Yet we have hysteria, we have craziness, coming at us from the other side of the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to talk about some of the reasons why this is such an important thing for the country. To start with, if we go no further on this debate at all, every state in Australia has signed up to zero net emissions by 2050. How can this be a stupid thing for us to do if every state in Australia has already signed up to it?</span>

I want to ask those on the other side of the chamber to make their flagrant politicking and fear-mongering just a tiny bit plausible—please, just for the enjoyment of the fight!—because it's just so ridiculous.

                    </a>  No problem, Mr Deputy Speaker. The announcement Labor made a couple of weeks ago is completely and positively mainstream. In fact, 73 countries in the world have already agreed to it. We know that if we are going to meet our Paris targets, as the government insistently claims that it will do—and we know it will probably fail to do—it will require us to hit net zero emissions by 2050. We've got the biggest employing companies right across the country essentially falling over themselves to come forward with their plans for how they're going to reach zero net emissions by 2050. Today Rio Tinto, a very large emitter, has said it is going to hit zero net emissions by 2050. Yet those opposite, who are supposed to be showing leadership and running the country, are telling us that this is implausible and silly. Rio Tinto have told us that, to get to zero net emissions by 2050, they are going to spend $1.5 billion investing in making that change. Do you know what that means? It means thousands and thousands of jobs for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think people are sick of being terrified in this discussion. The continental drift that is being created by the lack of policy leadership on the other side of the House is leaving people feeling that the government has lost control of how to manage this problem. What I want to talk to you about today is the action we can take and the huge economic opportunities that will come if we face the reality of this problem, like 73 other countries around the world have done, and actually plan for how we are going to transition our economy to net zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there is one thing I really want people to shift in their thinking about how we are talking about this issue in Australia today it's this: so much of the debate we have about climate change in this country pits the concept of economic growth, of jobs, against climate action. It tells us we're going to have to pay more if we take climate action. These conflicts are fictional; they really are. What we know from the best research that is being done on this is that if we make a plan, and if we make the transition well, we are going to have cheaper power, more jobs and faster growth if we take climate action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the first thing I want to talk about is climate action and jobs, because there is massive potential for us to employ thousands and thousands of Australians in new industries that will emerge or grow because we have a plan to take climate action. The Business Council of Australia—generally no friends of the Labor Party—have also made a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 because they know that this is good for the economy and good for jobs but that we're only going to get those good outcomes if we have a clear aspiration and target and we have a plan to achieve it. The BCA have calculated that moving to net zero emissions by 2050 will unleash $22 billion of investment in Australia each year. When we hear those words 'investment in Australia', that equals jobs; it equals jobs and it equals future growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO has also estimated that, if we continue on our current path, our GDP out to 2060 will grow by 2.1 per cent annually, but, if we target net zero emissions by 2050, we will grow, on average, by 2.75 per cent and wages growth will be higher. So for anyone out there who's having this conflict about, 'We've got to choose between a growing economy and climate action,' I want you to understand this: climate action means growth and it means jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues that I think the coalition is having with coming to terms with this concept is that its counterfactual for what happens in a world where we don't have a plan to 2050 is that nothing changes. That is not going to happen. Change is inevitable, and it's not just being created by climate action. The workforce is going to change a lot between now and 2050. In 2050, I will be 70; I will be transitioning out of work—that is how far away we are talking here. Think about how different our economy, our workplaces and our working lives looked in 1990. A similar mode of transition is going to happen. The question for us in this chamber is: are we going to try to shape that in any way? Are we going to try to make sure that we get benefits as our economy transitions, or are we just going to stick our heads in the sand and pretend that, if we don't take action on climate change, nothing about our workplaces is going to change? It's wrong. It's a fiction. And I reckon any Australian that you talk to will tell you the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker McVeigh, I want to talk to you about one example of this, and this is very relevant to the debate about the thermal coal mining sector. There was a period of time in this country where, at its peak, thermal coal mining employed 200,000 people in its workforce. Today it employs 40,000 people. That's not because of the Labor Party. It's not because of any political party. It's not because of climate change and climate action. It's because of automation. These things are going to continue to happen. They are going to continue to change. And you've got two options here: a political party that wants to pretend that that's not really happening, to put its head in the sand and say, 'Oh no, if we just ignore climate change then nothing's going to change for the way that we work in this country,' or a political party that accepts the absolute reality of what is going on here—that things are going to look very different in 2050 and there's no way for us to pretend that we can completely stop change. We've got a choice: to shape it, or to ignore it and to pay the costs. We want to do the responsible thing and that is: to show leadership and make sure that we get the great benefits out of this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about how we are going to do that, I can tell you that we have one guiding concern about how we deal with our climate policies, and that is: how we are going to deal with the employment and work outcomes of this. My political party was founded on work. That is what we do. We create and help Australians prepare for dignified jobs that support their families. So when we look at this climate change discussion, we're going to have a choice for Australians. They can go for this party over here—the party of Work Choices, who like to somehow pretend they've discovered credentials with working Australians—or a political party that's existed for 125 years for that express purpose. We are incredibly concerned about how we make sure we make that transition in a way that grows jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor leader gave a great speech on this very subject last year in Perth, talking about climate and the future of work. One of the things that he talked about was the explosion of opportunities that we are actually going to see in the resources sector should we make a proper plan to transition to a better climate future. One of the reasons for that is that we have such a huge endowment of rare earth metals here in Australia, and if we are planning properly for this future—if we've got a government that's willing to get the policy settings right—then we can see an explosion of jobs in this very sector. According to Northern Minerals, a rare earth mine can employ approximately 100 people. But if we think about how we can generate full industries that support these mines, then up to a million jobs can be created in this sector alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got some of the greatest reserves in the world of iron and titanium, the second greatest reserves of copper and lithium, and the third greatest deposits of silver. These are minerals that will fuel the clean energy economies of the 21st century. So there's a huge opportunity for us here, and it's one that we're not going to capture if we pretend that climate change isn't really happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hydrogen is another one that is pretty obvious. Experts tell us that achieving 50 per cent renewable energy at home, while building a hydrogen export industry, could create 87,000 good well-paid jobs. So there is a great future here for resources, in particular. And that's just one example. We could go through a great deal of the sectors in our economy and talk about how climate is not about costing jobs here; it's about seeing the huge opportunities that we Australians have to capture, but we're only going to get there if we've got a plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other issues here is the question about power prices. I keep reading these surveys that are done on Australians talking about, 'Do you agree that you need to take climate action?' and 'Do you agree that you will continue to do that if your power bills go up?' This conflict is a fiction. In fact, when the government was first elected almost seven years ago now, the climate change deniers over there tried to get a report on renewables up saying that renewables would drive up the cost of power, and they got Dick Warburton to do that report— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr STEVENS:</span>
                    </a>  I'd like to start by addressing some of the principles and some of the rubbish that's been spread about the Urban Congestion Fund by those opposite, particularly in the South Australian context. I intend to talk about some of the very important investments that are going to be undertaken in my electorate of Sturt and across the state of South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I first want to say I've actually got a unique perspective on the Urban Congestion Fund, because, when the work was commenced on identifying these projects, I worked in the South Australian state government for the Premier. So I'm very aware of the way in which the decisions were made in my state of South Australia as to what projects we'd be choosing and funding as part of this program. So just to be clear, the first thing that occurred was the South Australian state government was approached by the federal government saying: 'What are your priorities as a state government to address urban congestion in the metropolitan Adelaide area? What is the view of the department of the experts—of the engineers, of the people that do the modelling—about where the choke points are across metropolitan Adelaide that you would like Commonwealth government funding support to address, so we can have an outcome that's going to see people getting to work and home to their families quicker and safer?' Those were the simple principles that were put to the state government—nothing more. Not 'But only in these electorates,' or 'Not in this area,' or 'Make sure this one's on the list.' It was a simple query as to what was the view of the bureaucracy and the experts, because of studies that were done, informed by engineering et cetera, as to what projects should be selected. The South Australian government asked their department to undertake this body of work. That was done, and a list came back. That list was put from the state government to the federal government. That's how we landed upon the important projects that we're investing in in South Australia through the Urban Congestion Fund. And those, of course, are across metropolitan Adelaide, and they're based on need and they're based on achieving an outcome, achieving productivity gain. I'm lucky enough that three of them are in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one I want to reflect on is probably the most significant one in my electorate because it's right in the middle of my seat, the Magill and Portrush Roads intersection, where we're spending nearly $100 million. It's not just an intersection by the way; Portrush Road is part of Highway 1. This is the main artery of our country and our economy, and it carries an enormous amount of freight. It also carries a lot of commuters, of course. It's a very important intersection. It's one that was modelled as being the most congested in metropolitan Adelaide. That's why we chose it and are funding it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department, the experts, have said: 'You've got 65,000 vehicles moving through there every day. You've got an enormous amount of heavy freight.' Portrush Road, Highway 1, takes freight from the south-east of the state, and even from Western Victoria, through to Port Adelaide and up into the northern suburbs area. It's the designated freight route through metropolitan Adelaide. We've got schools along that route. We've got pedestrians and bike riders, all the way up to major B-doubles carrying stock, heavy machinery, produce and product et cetera along that corridor. It's vitally important that we take every opportunity when we're making these investment decisions on infrastructure to do projects exactly like this, because they lead to an outcome that's not only improving the economic productivity of our country, our state and my electorate but also providing safety and efficiency from a commuter point of view. This is a $98 million project that's jointly funded, fifty-fifty, because it's Highway 1—that's the way the funding mix tends to be between Commonwealth and state. We're going to see a transformation of that bottleneck in the middle of my electorate. We're going to see extra right-hand turn lanes, extra left-turn slip lanes and more through lanes for Portrush Road in each direction. We're really going to transform this from one of the worst bottlenecks in my electorate to something that's free-flowing, smooth and an excellent outcome for the people of my electorate. I'm very happy and grateful about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also really grateful that the Labor Party's position is that they don't support projects like this. They're against it, which is welcome. I look forward to prosecuting at the next election, when this is open and everyone is achieving the benefits of this project and many others, that, if it were up to Labor, it never would have happened—this and many other projects in my electorate and so many other electorates not just in South Australia but across the country. It's a very odd political decision to make, but they are in opposition. It's all making sense to me how they've been there for so very, very long. They're criticising and attacking significant infrastructure investments throughout this country that are going to provide great outcomes to the communities and economies which they are benefiting. I welcome Labor's opposition to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also welcome their opposition to the Fullarton Road crossroad intersection at the bottom of my electorate, bordering the member for Boothby's electorate. There are going to be so many commuters in her electorate who can't wait to see the great outcome from that intersection being upgraded. It's going to make it so much easier for people to get to and from their place of work, take the kids to sport, get home more quickly and have more time with their families at home or wherever they're undertaking their leisure. That's another great investment being made by this government, and, of course, one that's being opposed by those opposite. I look forward to prosecuting the fact that they don't want to see these sorts of things occurring when we go to the polls in a few years time. I'm going to be very excited about prosecuting that outcome. I know that the families and businesses in those areas in my electorate, the member for Boothby's electorate and the electorate of Adelaide, which is one that you hold—but you don't support spending money in one of your electorates. Good on you! Well done! We're looking forward to prosecuting that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third significant one is the intersection of Glen Osmond Road and Fullarton Road, which is near the one I just spoke of, which, again, is on the border of my electorate and the seat of Adelaide. It's another project they don't support, evidently, which is going to bring a great outcome to my constituents and the constituents of the member for Adelaide. It's one that, again, the Labor Party thinks is not worth the money that we're investing. I say: 'Good. You're welcome to that position. It gives me comfort that that's your position. I'm glad that you don't support investing in my electorate or the electorates of other members represented in this parliament.' But I think you're going to get a pretty rude surprise from the people of the eastern suburbs of Adelaide when you take that proposition to the next election. You don't like seeing money invested in their local community. You don't like seeing the kinds of outcomes that we're going to achieve, particularly the safety outcomes. I've got seven junior schools along Portrush Road corridor in my electorate, which, obviously, have children coming and going in highly dangerous circumstances at times because of all this heavy freight cramming down that tightened thoroughfare all the time. We're going to fix it, and you're against that. Thank you for making that a fairly straightforward proposition for me to prosecute going into the next election.</span>

Well, for too many small businesses in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury it's not working out that way, and for some it is a time of desperation, with visitor numbers still a long way down and the bills a long way up. One business that was fire affected has been successful, but they've endured weeks of uncertainty after initially being told they were not eligible. The fire burnt their property before Christmas, and here it is, more than two months on, and they're just getting some assistance now.</span>

It was thanks to an amazing effort that no homes were lost, but properties and buildings were impacted and business just dropped off completely. But Glenda and others like her are being told they're not entitled to grants or to any other support. Their only possible option is a loan, and the process for applying for that is another roller-coaster in itself. Remember, this is being asked of people who've been through the fear and threat of fire—for some, the fear, when they left their property as fire approached, that their property would be gone, that animals would be dead, and even that family members or neighbours might be gone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Congratulations to 23-year-old Penguin local Cale Barrett who took out the 2020 Oceania Snooker Championship on Sunday. It was Cale's first-ever victory in an open snooker event, and this breakthrough win has given him the option to compete in the World Snooker Tour in the next two years. Cale's snooker apprenticeship started many years earlier. His dad, Garth, attributes Cale's success to a misspent youth at The Penguin, the local pub which Garth used to operate. Cale was always keen to challenge local patrons whenever he could, and the result was an ever-growing pot of gold coins sitting at the end of the bar with Cale's name on it. Cale was first selected in the senior eight-ball team at age 13 and was the first person to simultaneously hold Australian junior titles in both snooker and eight ball. Cale is an outstanding role model for any young kid who is chasing their dream, whatever it may be: he trains hard, and, most importantly, he's persistent. Congratulations again, Cale. You're a good young fella. The snooker world is at your feet, and I wish you all the very best in whatever the future holds for you.</span>

But I can cheer. And I will be cheering on the Wanneroo Giants women's team—which I sponsor—located at the Wanneroo Giants Baseball Club, the home of baseball in the north, at the Kingsway sporting complex. The club held a ladies day on 2 February, which I was unable to attend, so I caught up with the ladies team on Sunday, and they gave me my very own jersey: look, it's No. 1! I'm very excited about it. I'll be sure to wear my jersey the next time I throw the first pitch of the season—and maybe this time the ball won't bounce. I'm very excited about the Roo Girls, as they're referred to. They played a great game on Saturday, as they do each time they're out there on the diamond, with their enthusiasm, their passion and, of course, their sporting prowess. I want to give a shout-out to Greg Elliott, the president of the Giants, and to Dazza Riley, vice-president and life member, for their dedication and especially for their work in promoting the women's team. Player numbers at the club continue to grow, and the Giants are always snapped up to play for the Perth Heat in the Australian Baseball League—as well as for the US league; one of the well-known names is Liam Hendricks, whose nickname is 'Slider' and who plays for the Oakland Athletics team in the US—and this year, from the women's team, they are Makayla George and Caitlyn Eynon. Good on you!</span>

I've had a number of purchases on my patch that have come about as a requirement of Defence wanting to expand operations. I have backed all along Defence and the national right to do this, but I can tell you that the current act treats the landholders worse than rubbish. It is an appalling system. It can typically take up to 20 years to settle the claims that go with that.</span>

I have certainly put mine in. I've written a paper suggesting what I believe the new regulations should look like in this space. I call on anyone else in Australia who has been the subject of the Commonwealth Lands Acquisition Act to make sure they get their submissions in at this time and have their say.</span>

There are some similar characters. Obviously, the cool kids sit up the back. There are the kids who came up with few friends—and they sit with the other kids on the crossbench. And then we've got the kids who think they're cool—g'day to the Nats and their Akubras in the corner! There's the kid who does the bare minimum; he blame-shifts and thinks that, the louder he yells, the more his point comes across; but really he just annoys everyone. He sits at the dispatch box—he's the Prime Minister! As it happens he is also the kid who went on an overseas holiday during a critical assignment—just to get the cheap flights! And then there's the one kid who would probably gloat on the Monday 'Miss, I've already done the project; it's all good, Miss' and then on Friday, despite all the big promises, fails to deliver and we get all the childish excuses: 'Miss, my homework got burnt in the bushfires', 'Miss, my homework's got coronavirus.' He'd be the Treasurer! To the Treasurer: growth is down, wages are flat, underemployment is at a record high, net debt has doubled and now your surplus that never was looks gone. Your report card reads 'must do better'. Promise less, Treasurer, and deliver more.</span>

Millions will be watching on TV and literally thousands will be lining the streets. Mardi Gras is an important celebration of gay and lesbian culture and a symbol of the vibrancy which adds so much to Sydney's diversity. Since the first parade, in 1978, Mardi Gras has grown to be the world-leading festival that it is today, bringing thousands of tourists and spectators from across Australia and the world to Sydney and its eastern suburbs. The march makes its way up Oxford Street from Hyde Park, through Taylor Square and onto Flinders Street, and finishes in Moore Park. It's an enormous celebration that has become a key part of the Sydney calendar. I congratulate those who work so hard to make sure Mardi Gras is a success each year—in particular, Albert Kruger, the chief executive officer; Kate Wickett, the co-chair of the board; and the rest of the organisers. I also want to congratulate all those who worked so hard on the successful bid for Sydney to host World Pride in 2023. I'll be marching proudly in the parade on Saturday night, as the local MP, for the second part of the march. Happy Mardi Gras!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  For the past few weeks a house in my electorate has been flying banners from its windows sporting the Nazi swastika. Neighbours are understandably outraged and have called on the landlord, the Tasmanian Department of Housing, to take action. The Tasmanian Premier, too, has expressed his outrage. And I join them all. Unfortunately, it seems the department has no powers to act. I don't know whether the person flying this material is evil, deranged, ignorant or some combination of them all. No matter the motivation, there is no place for the Nazi swastika in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to state my support for the Tasmanian government taking strong action against this tenant in order to get this symbol of hatred and division removed from our community. There is no room in this country for it. The head of ASIO, Mike Burgess, warns us that far Right threats are on the rise in Australia. We ignore this evil ideology and all it stands for at our peril. Nazis are enemies of democracy and enemies of our nation, and they must be dealt with swiftly and with resolve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more positive note, I'd just like to congratulate the Westerway Primary School, which this Saturday will celebrate its centenary with a big fair day. It's free to attend. It runs from 10 am to 3 pm. Many thanks to Zelda Browning, Andrea Long, Wendy Holdsworth, Rob Clark and everyone else involved in putting on what will be a fantastic day in the valley. Saturday also sees the official opening of the 2020 Junior State Surf Life Saving Championships at Carlton Beach. No matter where you are in Tasmania on Saturday, it will be terrific.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  I would like to congratulate the Australian Academy of Martial Arts on the official opening of their new training facility, or dojo, in Mount Gravatt last week. As AAMA continued to grow, the need for a few dojo became apparent, and they approached me about community grants. I was more than happy to help. I was very pleased to be able to support this upgrade with a $185,000 Morrison government grant to help the club continue its 47-year legacy in the Mount Gravatt community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the official opening, I met with AAMA founder, Shihan Graham Keller, who provided us with a special martial arts demonstration. With a 47-year legacy in the region, it's so important that we support our local sporting clubs to help them remain a part of their community for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding contribution from our government not only helped build this fantastic new dojo; it also means the volunteer operated club will be able to continue offering affordable karate tuition fees for families. Martial arts is a great inclusive sport for women, children and families. Teaching philosophies such as courtesy, self-discipline, self-defence and fitness, I'm glad the Morrison government is helping AAMA continue its teachings in the community for all ages and abilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also would like to acknowledge the state government and the Brisbane City Council for their contribution to complete this project. An inclusive community is a happy community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Poorly maintained copper services are a regular complaint in Mayo. High rainfall erodes ageing infrastructure, and, in many places, the bushfires have destroyed it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that the copper network damaged in the recent fires in my electorate will not be repaired to the standard we can expect from the $297 million subsidy paid to Telstra to deliver landline services. I have constituents who had landlines damaged in the 2015 Sampson Flat fire who were still waiting for permanent repairs as recently as October last year. This cannot be repeated. We understand fire damage takes time to repair, but to have no landline service and poor mobile phone service is causing enormous distress. Trying to explain that problem to overseas call centres adds to the distress, as do promises of satellite phones that have never arrived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues need to be addressed. My office has made every effort to assist constituents. I will say the local Telstra and Optus teams have been diligent. I'd like to thank Mark Bolton from Telstra for providing timely information. I'd also like to thank to Kym Morgan and Jill Bottrall from NBN for bringing free satellite wi-fi to Cudlee Creek and then to Kangaroo Island, where various sites remain. All these services have made an enormous difference to the connectivity of these fire affected communities. It takes time to recover from bushfires, but, as we rebuild, let's do this better.</span>

I reiterate, as I've said many times before, how grateful we are in South Australia to the Prime Minister and Minister Andrews for their decision to base the Australian Space Agency in South Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a phenomenally exciting opportunity for my home city and state to be the cradle of what is going to be a booming new industry—the space industry. The allied sectors of that include cybersecurity, ag-tech, machine learning and all the most exciting future growth industries. They are all going to be linked to the space sector. The fact the decision has been made for the agency to be headquartered in Adelaide means that my home state is really going to be the engine room for the space industry into the future. It's important that we understand this is an opportunity, not a guarantee. I'm going to be working very hard, both here in Canberra and back home, to make sure that we maximise every opportunity available to us in South Australia, but the basis of that opportunity is the decision that was made by this government to base the Space Agency there. I was lucky enough to be with the Prime Minister, the Premier and Minister Andrews at the opening last week, and I'm so excited about the future it's going to provide for Adelaide.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  New education department data shows that about 620 apprentices and trainees in Darwin and Palmerston have been lost under Scott Morrison's third-term Liberal government, and it's holding our Top End community back, and our economy back. Around Australia, that figure is 140,000. There are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees now than there were when those opposite took government. It is hurting not only the Territory's economy but our nation's economy. As a result, we now have a shortage of bricklayers, plumbers, hairdressers, bakers, electricians, mechanics, panel beaters and other critical trades. The Prime Minister's skills crisis is holding back local businesses and denying local jobs. We've got great businesses up in the Northern Territory. They want to grow and hire more staff, but they've been let down by the failure in education, the failure to properly fund the TAFE sector. Don't just take my word for it. The Australian Industry Group says that 75 per cent of businesses report that they are struggling to find the qualified workers that they need. That's what happens when you rip $3 billion out of this vital sector for the growth of our economy and this nation.</span>

I know some incredibly talented people here and around the country who are very tech-savvy, but there are also people who seek to use this platform for the most hideous reasons. Technology is an increasingly important part of our everyday lives, whether it's getting photo updates of what your child is up to at day care or using an iPad or iPhone as a part of the child's learning or entertainment. I confess that I'm guilty of handing over my iPhone to my daughter, and she walks around and pretends that I'm on the phone or she tries to watch TV shows. However, increasingly, along with many other parents, I am becoming acutely aware of the need to protect our kids online. We established the world's first eSafety Commissioner, and so far we have reached over 452,000 students, parents and community groups through the e-safety outreach; investigated over 42,000 cases of illegal online content; and addressed over 1,300 complaints about serious cyberbullying against Australian children. We must keep our kids safe from cyberbullying and the horrendous things that happen over the internet. I know that I speak for everyone in this place when I say that we will always work together to protect our children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian Liberal government is committed to net zero emissions by 2050. In fact, every single state and territory government throughout the country is committed to this goal. They have joined companies like BHP, Rio, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Energy Council and 73 other nations in calling for net zero emissions by 2050. Why? Because it's the right thing to do by our economy, our environment and, importantly, our kids. The only organisation of people in this country who won't accept net zero emissions by 2050 is the Morrison government. When, Prime Minister, will you accept the science of climate change? When will you realise the facts about economic growth and climate change? When will you join with Labor and accept net zero emissions by 2050?</span>

Earlier in the House I stood to speak about the importance of supporting Australian families and about how we on this side of the chamber reward their hard work by allowing them to keep more of what they earn. Now, you would think that this would be an issue important to all of our elected representatives. Surely ensuring families to get ahead is a priority for all of us. Well, it isn't for the Labor members opposite. While I was speaking about how the Morrison government is supporting families with tax cuts, childcare subsidies, flexible paid parental leave and infrastructure, the member for Moreton stood up and moved that I no longer be heard. Why? Because Labor are about politics over people. Labor are pranksters, not policymakers. Labor are about jibes, not jobs. Labor are about road-blocking, not road-building. Labor can't be trusted to manage our economy. Labor can't be trusted to come into this place and respect the Australian people. </span>

Two thousand locals spoke out and signed a petition to oppose this development. Three hundred submissions were lodged by residents about the impact of this development on the lifestyle and amenity of those living on the lake. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the Forest Lake Action Group, the local businesses and the many volunteers who, led by our local councillor Charles Strunk, stood up to the Brisbane City Council. Over the last 16 years, the LNP-dominated council have used their massive majority to ignore residents. This shoddy, arrogant process of ignoring residents must end. The high-rise will have a major impact on our local environment, increase parking problems around the lake and overshadow what has always been a scenic community meeting place. I stress that this is a high-rise development in a low-density area. Our community has been utterly betrayed by the LNP Brisbane City Council, who are putting developers' profits before the needs of residents. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I live nearby the lake. My office is at Forest Lake. I stand with residents and will fight tooth and nail to make sure we do not see any more inappropriate developments for our community. The fight is not over. Our community must send the Brisbane City Council a strong message: no more high-rise for Forest Lake.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I believe it is important to connect Canberra and my community directly by giving my constituents the opportunity to speak with ministers often, and face to face, about the issues that matter to them. I commend this government for the fact that ministers have already made the journey up to the Sunshine Coast 42 times since my election in 2016, and I note the member for Swan will be coming up very, very shortly as well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next two weeks, I'll be hosting two more forums in Fisher to talk about some of the most important issues for my constituents. On Friday 6 March, at 2 pm, I will host the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management at the Beerwah community hall, where he'll be answering locals' questions about the government's response to this summer's devastating bushfires, as well as the ongoing impacts of drought in Queensland. On Tuesday 10 March, the Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology, Senator Hume, will join us at Venue 114 in Bokarina, from 4 pm, to talk about the future of retirement incomes in Australia over the next 30 years, and what support current and future retirees can already access. I'm very grateful to both ministers and, in fact, to all ministers for taking the time to come up to the Sunshine Coast. I would encourage all of my constituents to take every opportunity to come and listen to what they have to say.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I was saddened today to read a judgement delivered in the Family Court in Brisbane yesterday—saddened, but not surprised. The judge had to vacate a trial that had been set down for three days because this Morrison government cannot manage the family law system. The ban to prevent the perpetrators cross-examining their victims commenced in September 2019. The government ran out of money to fund the scheme the same year. They then put in a few more dollars to top it up and, again, the funding has run out, in February. Real families now cannot continue their family law trial without representation, and there is no funding left. We knew this would happen. It was predictable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the shadow Attorney-General and the shadow minister for family violence said, 'There is one glaring and very, very major omission: additional funding for Legal Aid to make it all work.' Families who are experiencing family violence are being put on hold because there is no money for their matters to proceed. The judgement gives some details about the state of the Brisbane registry. There are more than 35 trials that can't continue because the Morrison government has not provided the funding necessary to protect victims from being cross-examined by their perpetrators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government demonstrating practically that it doesn't care about families fleeing family violence. If the Morrison government cared about families more than they cared about their precious surplus, they would actually put some investment into the Brisbane registry. This is a disgrace, and I ask the Attorney-General to remedy it as quickly as possible.</span>

Princes Court Homes in Mildura won the Organisation Award for its outstanding contribution to the community over the past 60 years and its continued innovation and resilience in recent times. I congratulate CEO Jenny Garonne and Chair Lyn Heaysman and their entire team, who are so deserving of this award. The awards to Princes Court Homes continue as they joined Chaffey Aged Care and Jacaranda Village, all based in Mildura region, along with Murray House Aged Care, based just across the border in Wentworth, New South Wales, who together were awarded the Team Award for their collaborative initiatives focused on enhancing the lives of older people in north-west Victoria.</span>

Frustration and anger is growing in communities around Australia, including within the Coromandel Valley Ramblers Cricket Club. This club has next to no facilities. They applied for a Community Sport Infrastructure grant to construct a clubroom. Sport Australia gave their application 90 out of 100.</span>

                  </a>  It was. If there was a fair playing field, the Ramblers would've received this funding, but of course they missed out. The anger and disappointment felt by so many across the country was articulated by Roslyn, a parent who has two sons who play for the club. As Roslyn outlined, it's not just a sporting club; it's a grassroots group of volunteers who go above and beyond to mentor and support their young players. They deserve support from this government. Roslyn asked me, 'Is there anything you can do to highlight the enormous lack of fairness at the recent funding process?' Well, that's exactly what I'm doing for Roslyn and all of those young people and parents here today. Parents like Roslyn have questions for this Prime Minister, and they deserve answers. To what extent was the Prime Minister's office involved in vetoing deserving, highly rated applications, leaving young people without the facilities they deserve?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  On a more positive note, run solely off volunteer muscle, the Bribie Island Community Arts Centre is well known across the electorate of Longman for being the creative hub of the Bribie Island community. The arts centre began as a Chamber of Commerce project to celebrate Australia's bicentenary. It was designed by leading gallery architect Paul Wallace and was opened on 11 December 1988. Today the centre is one of Australia's largest and busiest arts centres, with space for display, retail, workshops and studios, catering for more than 20 kinds of arts and crafts. Many groups such as quilters, photographers, playgroups and garden clubs use the space to meet and create. The centre attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and there's a growing community of artists and crafters who foster creativity in the local area. Last month, I was pleased to be able to present the arts centre with a cheque for $20,230 to install air conditioning in the centre. The funds were granted through the Morrison government's MUSTER grants, which provide grants for projects to build community resilience and increase the ability of communities to connect, contribute and thrive. Thanks to this grant, visitors and volunteers can enjoy the centre more in summer conditions with air conditioning, and it will drive more people to visit the centre. It's just another example of what a strong economy can deliver to local communities.</span>

The Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians has said about the closure of an aged-care home in my electorate, 'Decisions of this nature are a matter for the organisation's management,' and refused my community's requests for assistance. How can that be the government's position when it gave more than half a million dollars to an aged-care home in the member for Nicholls's electorate, a home which is now closed?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our goals, the targets that we've set ourselves as a government over many years, have been accompanied by such plans—credible plans that we have taken to the Australian people on numerous occasions—and we have delivered on those plans. So we deliver on the targets that we set before the Australian people. We set ourselves a target at the last election that we'd be able to legislate to ensure that 94 per cent of Australians would not pay a marginal income tax rate more than 30 cents in the dollar. We had a plan to achieve that target, and we legislated that plan here in this place. Those opposite had it each way. They were against it and then they were for it; they were against it and then they were for it—backwards and forwards, as the each-way opposition leader always is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a plan when we were first elected to create one million jobs, and more than 1½ million jobs have been created as a result of the credible economic plans of the government. We had a plan, as we took to the last election, to create another 1¼ million jobs. We had a plan to keep our AAA credit rating. Under this government, under extreme pressures in terms of global forces and domestic pressures with droughts and other things, we've been able to maintain that AAA credit rating as a result of the strong financial management of the government. We had a plan to stop the boats. It wasn't a goal; it was a plan. It was achieved, and it continues to be achieved under the strong policies of this government. We had a plan to expand our trade, and we have lifted the trade covered by export agreements under this government from 26 per cent to 70 per cent and have the first current account surplus in decades. We had a plan to roll out the NBN and to get 500,000 people into the NDIS, and we are delivering on that plan. We had a plan to increase the budget for defence to two per cent of GDP from the worst levels we've seen, which we inherited from those opposite—prewar levels of investment for defence—and we are delivering on that plan and we are delivering on that target.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we set targets, our government has plans to achieve them. That's why the Australian people trust this government to deliver on plans. At times like this, when we are putting plans in place to protect Australians from the coronavirus, they know that we will get through this because we have a plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure,Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:08</span>):  I thank the member for Cowper for his question. In his electorate we're seeing the result of government investment and the ways it can shape a community's future. The member knows that all too well. He got elected because he fought hard. He advocated hard for the people of his Mid North Coast electorate. This government has a plan for regional Australia, just like the member for Cowper has a plan for his people. We know that regional Australia is the engine room of our economy. When the regions are strong, so too is our nation. When the Mid North Coast is strong, so too is New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure plays an integral role in our plan for the future. That important word 'plan'—a blueprint, a vision to unlock potential, whether it's in Cowper, Port Macquarie or Coffs Harbour; wherever it is—is backed by a $100 billion infrastructure rollout over the next decade. Our regional communities are driven by industry, driven by agriculture, driven by tourism and driven by services, just to name a few. They need good infrastructure and they need a good plan, and with the Liberals and Nationals in government that is what they're getting, both at a federal level and, in New South Wales, at a state level. And, by ensuring a strong economy, we create opportunities for businesses to grow, for small businesses to prosper and hire more people, because it's small businesses that have enabled this nation to have 1½ million new jobs created since we came into government. It's a good plan. It's a good blueprint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Round 3 of the Building Better Regions Fund held tourism in focus. When we invest in regional tourism, we boost development. When tourists travel to a regional community they can see the vibrancy that's out there. Regional Australia is not broken. I've said it time and time again. Regional Australia deserves visiting. Regional Australia deserves investment. People should make, should consider, should think about that tree change and get out to regional Australia and see the vibrancy, see the development, see the prospects, see the future that is in regional Australia—just like in the member for Cowper's electorate.</span>

                  </a>  It is part of the plan, Member for Grayndler! It is certainly part of the plan. A $6½ million investment in the community through the BBRF is now open and running world-class events. We were there for the Aussie Rules grand final. I won't tell you how the member for Cowper's drop-punt went into the crowd, but he was there. He was there with the local mayor, he was there with me, and we were there with a lot of supporters. And they were thrilled because he advocated hard for that stadium and he delivered. All part of the plan. All part of the blueprint. It is a project which Coffs Harbour City Council general manager, Steve McGrath, said was only made possible through joint funding from the Australian government. He understands, as good general managers do, that we've got a plan. We're rolling it out. We're investing and boosting regional Australia— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, following the shocking deaths of thousands of sheep aboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> in 2017, some weak reforms to the live animal export industry were announced. It now turns out that, despite most Australians still opposing this cruel trade, even the flimsy reforms have been quietly dumped. Deputy Prime Minister, this week why did you ignore the advice of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and approve a live animal export ship that failed ventilation requirements? And how can the community ever believe that the government cares about animal welfare when even the half-baked safeguards we do have are ignored on a ministerial whim?</span>

                  </span>I thank the member for Canning for his question and note that he has served this country with distinction in uniform. When we came to government, unemployment was rising, investment was falling and the budget was deep in the red. Since coming to government we committed to our plan to create more than one million jobs and we've created more than 1½ million jobs. We committed to reduce taxes and we have passed through the parliament more than $300 billion worth of tax cuts. We committed to the Australian people that we would bring the budget back into balance and we've delivered the first balanced budget in 11 years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know those opposite prefer wellbeing budgets to balanced budgets. And they are led, inspired, by their spiritual leader, the mmmm-member for Rankin. I was thinking yesterday, as the member for Rankin was coming into the chamber—fresh from his ashram deep in the Himalayas, barefoot, robes flowing, incense burning, beads in one hand, wellbeing budget in the other—what would the yoga position be that the member for Rankin would assume?</span>

In his electorate there are more than 19,000 small and medium-sized businesses that are benefiting from the tax cuts that we have passed and from our extended instant asset write-off announced in last year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government, unemployment was 5.7 per cent and rising, investment was in freefall, and the budget deficit was $48½ billion, or around three per cent of GDP. That occurred on Labor's watch, when they had been enjoying iron ore prices more than double what they are today, at $180. They also saw in their last year in office more than 62,000 small businesses close their doors. Since we've come to government, we've delivered on our plan to create more than one million new jobs—in fact, more than 1½ million new jobs. We've delivered on our plan to lower taxes, legislating more than $300 billion of tax cuts through the parliament, which will see 94 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar. We've delivered on our plan to cut taxes for small and medium-sized businesses—millions of small and medium-sized businesses—who will see their company tax rate go down to 25 per cent. We've delivered on our plan to secure more free trade agreements—in fact, taking the percentage of our two-way trade covered by free trade agreements from 26 per cent to more than 70 per cent. And what we have seen is employment growth today at 1.9 per cent. That is nearly double the OECD average and nearly triple the average that we inherited. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the participation rate across the economy in terms of employment is 66.1 per cent. This compares to 64.8 per cent when we took office. Over 300,000 jobs were created in 2018-19—a hundred thousand more than Treasury had forecast. And more women and more senior Australians are finding employment. In fact, female employment has increased by 183,000 in the last 12 months, with seven out of 10 jobs in full-time work, with female participation at a record high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what comes with disciplined economic management. The Australian people and the Australian economy dodged a bullet at the last election. Could you imagine dealing with the drought, the fires and now the coronavirus with $387 billion of higher taxes? That's what the Australian people were going to face under a Labor government. Thankfully, they got a coalition government. We're creating more jobs and delivering lower taxes.</span>

                  </a>  He knows that we went to the last election with a plan to deliver a fair deal on energy for all Australians while we reduce our emissions. He also knows that we are delivering. Indeed, just today we've announced that, from 1 July, the dodgy late-payment penalties that were inflicted by energy companies on many Australian families and small businesses will come to an end. A new rule will ensure that can't happen. Any company that doesn't comply will pay penalties of up to $100,000. This builds on strong action we've already taken: establishing price caps, establishing reference prices to make it easier to get the best possible deal and getting more supply of electricity and gas into the marketplace. We're doing all of this while we ensure that the grid is reliable, with projects like Snowy 2.0 and Marinus Link, and that emissions are coming down. Just in the last year we've seen domestic emissions in Australia down by 2.3 per cent and, indeed, over three per cent in the electricity market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the situation with regard to coronavirus, we now know that the latest figures show that over 81,300 people have been diagnosed with having coronavirus, and 2,770 have, sadly, lost their lives. In particular, though, what has characterised global developments in the recent week has been the spread across countries outside of China. In the last 24 hours, I'm advised that Algeria, Brazil, Greece and Pakistan have confirmed their first cases. What is interesting about that, sadly, is that we have Africa, South America, West Asia and Europe all with new countries with their first case. What this says is that the arc of the virus continues to expand—that we are seeing more countries and more diagnoses, particularly outside of China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, the very clear message for Australians is that we are not immune, but we are well prepared. It remains the case that there are only 15 cases that have been diagnosed within the general public in Australia. All have cleared the virus, as the Prime Minister has confirmed this week. And I thank state and territory health authorities. Within the Northern Territory, it remains that there are eight cases, which have come from passengers from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamond Princess</span>. All are in containment, with mild to moderate conditions. A number of additional cases have been tested and found to be negative, and there are two currently being tested, on the latest advice—actually provided to me during question time by Professor Len Notaras, the head of the national trauma centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, though, the very clear message to Australians is: at this point in time, there is clear containment, but, with a world where we are seeing increasing numbers, we have to be ever vigilant, which is precisely why we have developed, in conjunction with the states and the territories and Commonwealth agencies, the national pandemic plan. This pandemic plan is aimed at protecting Australians against what could be a global threat. We don't varnish it. We set it out. But we say to the Australian people: we are well prepared. We are as well prepared as anybody in the world. And we will get through this.</span>

Given that the Audit Office and Sport Australia have both confirmed that the sports rorts projects were approved on 11 April, the day the election was called, why was the brief approving the projects backdated by the government by a week to 4 April? Didn't the government know the decision was dodgy and wasn't it trying to cover its tracks?</span>

This government took a very clear plan to the last election—in fact, to the last several elections—where we wanted to clean up Labor's mess. We wanted to make sure that we didn't have children drowning at sea. We wanted to make sure that we didn't hand back control of our borders to people-smuggling networks. And we've been successful with that plan. There's no sense in putting forward a plan if you have no detail and no possible way in which you can achieve success in that plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now when Labor went to the election, they promised that there would be no boats and that there would be no children in detention. That was their promise, and that was their hope and that was their plan. What happened? Their plan resulted in 50,000 people arriving on 800 boats. But it got much worse than that. There were 1,200 people, at least, who drowned at sea. That is their record. So when they talk about having a plan, the Labor Party will always have these airy-fairy ideals. They'll always pretend to the Australian public that, somehow, they've got the detail worked out. Well, their detail of their plan resulted in 8,000 children going into detention. That is the legacy of the Labor Party. Now, have they learnt anything at all? No, they have not. Today they still hold the same plan—the same plan for failure—that they've taken to the last several elections. If there were an election tomorrow, their plan would be: no boats, no kids in detention, nobody drowning at sea. If they were elected, Mr Speaker, I promise you there would be people on boats within weeks. That's the reality. And the Australian public should be very, very wary. They're promising plans in other areas of public policy. This one, off in 2050. Anyone who believes this Leader of the Opposition only needs to look at his track record. He has had so many different positions when it comes to border protection. He's been in favour of strong border protection policies. He's been against those policies. He has an each-way bet on every single public-policy position. The problem is that the Australian public suffer, both financially and in terms of our international reputation. We've now got 702 people off Manus and Nauru to the United States. The Labor Party did not have a plan to get one person off Manus or Nauru. We'll continue—</span>

Because of the Morrison government's strong budget management, we are able to invest a record $200 billion in our defence capability and achieve two per cent of GDP in defence spending in the next financial year. This record investment is creating many jobs in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday Senator Molan and I had the great pleasure of visiting Lintek, an Australian small business employing 50 Australians just down the road in Queanbeyan. It was a great pleasure to meet the Lintek team and to announce their new manufacturing capability in the global F-35 program. This new manufacturing capability will double Lintek's F-35 circuit board production capacity, and what this means for Lintek is that it's now in a much stronger position to increase its work on the F-35 program. Lintek is just one of those many small companies that, because of our investment, is able to export its products overseas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year I visited the US to fight for more Australian work in the US program. I was proud to announce upon my return that the Western Sydney base Quickstep was awarded additional work to provide some 10 new parts to the global F-35 program. Proudly, there is currently US$250,000 worth of Australian Quickstep equipment on every F-35 globally. Their world-leading capability is yet another example of an outstanding Australian success story in our defence industry. Quickstep and Lintek are just some of the 50 companies who are sharing in some $1.7 billion worth of work on the Joint Strike Fighter Project. Talking about jobs: yes, this program is currently supporting some 2,400 Australian jobs, with thousands more expected by 2023.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House are backing our defence industry, and small, medium and large defence industry businesses. At the same time we're creating thousands of Australian jobs. That's what record investment of $200 billion will get you. It will get you support for our defence industry, ensuring that our men and women in uniform get the capability that they deserve. And it's only with sound financial management that we on this side are able to deliver what our men and women in uniform deserve, at the same time as creating Australian jobs.</span>

On our side of the parliament we are delivering on our plan for fast and affordable broadband for all Australians. When it comes to rollout, we are delivering: 10.8 million premises able to connect; 6.6 million premises are connected; and 30,000 to 40,000 premises per week are connecting to the National Broadband Network. By contrast, when Labor had responsibility for this project, after six years barely 51,000—compared to 30,000 to 40,000 per week under this government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, two-thirds of homes and businesses connected are taking a 50 megabit or higher speed plan. The NBN is affordable. Prices are steadily dropping. Last year, the NBN introduced a $35 wholesale 12/1 plan. That allows retailers to deliver an affordable, entry-level $60 plan, making the NBN more affordable to some 500,000 budget-conscious households. We are getting on with delivering the NBN in accordance with our plan.</span>

                  </a>  In the downfall phase of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, the Leader of the Opposition briefly had responsibility for the NBN. Here's what he had to say on 4 September 2013: 'We are rolling out the NBN as fast as it can be rolled out. This is the largest infrastructure project in Australia's history. You can't just click your fingers and get it done.' He thought that was as fast as they could go, but he was wrong, wrong, wrong! </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're getting it delivered much faster. The reason is that we have a plan. The Labor approach is to promise the earth and not worry for a second if you can't actually deliver it. That was the approach when they promised to end the double drop-off. Remember that? 260 new childcare centres to be delivered, promised in 2007. They pulled the plug after they delivered 38. Remember the GP Super Clinics? Twenty-eight were promised at the 2010 election. They actually delivered one by 2013—</span>

                  </a>  I'm very happy to talk about the NBN and Labor's approach, which was to dream up the policy in a few weeks, with the details on the back of a beer coaster; to appoint a board with virtually no experience of rolling out a telecommunications network; and to make roll-out decisions on where the best photo opportunity was, not on what customers needed. By contrast, we're getting the NBN delivered, compared to the job done by this hopeless rabble opposite.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CONROY:</span>
                  </a>  This is a government that continues to preside over corrupt programs—corrupt programs that use taxpayers' resources to derive personal political benefit for members of the Liberal and National parties. You have to consider how this started. The scene was set in 2018, when after knocking off Malcolm Turnbull this was a desperate government. This was a government driven by division, a government with no agenda but holding onto power. So they turned to looking at any single program they could use to throw money for political benefit, to derive any political gain they could have from taxpayers' money. We've seen some of the most egregious rorting this nation has ever witnessed. We've seen rorting of the $100 million Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program and the $150 million female facilities and water safety stream. We've seen rorting at Olympic scale and then we've seen them try to make Senator McKenzie the patsy, the fall guy for this, saying that she did it all, that she was entirely responsible for this rorting. But the truth is that we know there was a conspiracy led by the Prime Minister's office to corrupt this process for grubby political ends. We only have to look at the events of the last two days in question time to see that confirmed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the details of sports rorts 1? We saw round 1, where 41 per cent of projects approved by the minister were not recommended by Sport Australia. The closer they got to the election, the more desperate they got; the more the Prime Minister tried to hold onto power by his fingernails. We saw 70 per cent of projects were rejected by Sport Australia. Round 3 was approved 17 minutes after we entered the caretaker period. Seventeen minutes after we entered the caretaker period, 73 projects were rejected by Sport Australia. It is not only that; we saw the ANAO decide the entire program is questionable in terms of its legality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What sorts of projects were supported against Sport Australia's recommendations? What sorts of projects required the Prime Minister and the minister to say, 'We're going to support battlers. We're going to support battlers in struggling suburbs'? There was $50,000 for one of richest golf clubs in the country, Royal Adelaide, to install solar panels. I'm reliably informed that's about one annual membership. If they got one more member for the club, they could have paid for the solar panels themselves. There was $500,000 that went to the struggling Mosman Rowing Club—that bastion of battlers! The member opposite is from Wyong. I'm sure many members there go to Mosman rowers for a good row, maybe a chardonnay afterwards. And then there was $190,000 for another golf club to install facilities for wedding receptions. Wedding receptions! How is that advancing sports participation in this country? What it does advance is the naked political interests of those opposite. Then the most egregious—my favourite was $50,000 to the Sans Souci Football Club for a project not only already funded; it was already built and it was opened three days later by the council!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw further revelations only last week that, despite the Prime Minister misleading this House that all projects approved were eligible, the ANAO in fact found that 43 per cent of projects, 290 projects in all, were ineligible. Under this corrupt program, the interventions came at the top. We saw 136 emails from the Prime Minister's office. We saw revelations today that, in round 3, where 73 per cent of projects were rejected by Sport Australia, Minister McKenzie wrote to the Prime Minister asking for permission, identifying the projects she intended to approve, on 10 April—colour coded in a spreadsheet by party status. And then after, presumably, the Prime Minister approved the 73 per cent of projects, the backdated brief was received by the department at 8.46 am on 11 April, 17 minutes after the caretaker period began. And again we saw today the Prime Minister misleading the House, saying that the projects were approved on 4 April, when, in fact, the substance of the email to the Prime Minister makes it very clear that the minister hadn't approved the projects when she wrote to the Prime Minister on 10 April. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even worse—if you can believe that—is that yesterday the Prime Minister was bragging about the political intervention of his party and his candidates in this process. He openly bragged about the now member for Lindsay—who was merely a candidate at that stage—dictating which projects would go to Lindsay. She identified which projects would be approved. He bragged about it yesterday. We saw in the ANAO report that the Queensland Liberal National Party head office—the secretariat—dictated which projects were going to Longman. Just imagine that for a second: a party headquarters decided how taxpayers' money would be allocated in a seat they were trying to win at the election. Yet again, we've seen this program corrupted, and we've seen the Prime Minister openly bragging about the level of political intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have sports rorts 2, the $150 million for the female facilities stream. It was meant to be regional. It was meant to help regional sporting clubs invest in female changing rooms to increase female participation. What we saw was no guidelines for the program, no applications process, no eligibility criteria and no merits based assessment—only hand-picked projects, and the money being treated as a slush fund by the government. And what was the result? For a program meant to target rural and regional areas, 80 per cent of the money went to building swimming pools—not female changing sheds—in marginal electorates in the cities. Only 10 per cent went to rural and regional areas. And the most egregious example was the $10 million for the North Sydney Olympic Pool—that renowned regional area! They've been creative about trying to defend it, I'll give them that. The mayor of North Sydney claimed it was a regional pool because someone from the country might have once swum there. Just think about that for a minute. We had some jokes today that maybe if they had classified it as a dam, they might have got support.</span>

                  </a>  Exactly—what a joke! What's next, the Sydney Harbour Bridge getting funding under the rural bridges program, or the Opera House getting support under a regional arts fund? This is how low this government has stooped. And the people who suffer are the people of Australia, particularly in those sporting clubs who are suffering. Garden Suburb Football Club in my electorate is turning away female soccer teams because the women need to get changed in the canteen or in their cars. These are the people who are suffering because this government presides over corrupted programs. These are programs run for one cause only: to advance their political interest. They are programs designed to misuse taxpayers' money—$250 million, in this case—to advance their political ends, to settle grubby political scores, and to win votes in a desperate bid to hold on to power after they knocked off their second Prime Minister. What a disgrace. And the Australian people are coming for them. The Australian people are sick of them. The Australian people will wreck on this in two years time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265931" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. These are serious times and they call on serious people. And the member for Shortland's 10 minutes of fame is up. That was an amazing performance for the member for Shortland. But this government is focused on making important decisions on the issues that matter to Australians. And we can commit the funding needed to address the problems that this country faces because of the strong economic and fiscal budget that this government oversees. I'm going to run through a range of those issues and challenges that we're facing and that we're committing support to—and we're able to do that because of that strong fiscal and budget management of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country is in drought. Australian farmers have had to contend with a terrible drought and this government has stepped up to support them. The government's plan in relation to drought is to provide immediate help to directly help those people experiencing hardships, to help local communities find local solutions and to invest in long-term resilience measures. We're investing more than $8 billion in drought-relief work, including $1 billion announced since the election. I'm going to run through those spending initiatives, because that's what this matter of public importance is about. Firstly, Shane Stone is heading up the National Drought and North Queensland Flood Response and Recovery Agency, putting staff on the ground to make sure that our response is right. There's $47 million to extend the Drought Communities Program to more councils, $20 million to help keep kids in school, and $5 million for child care. There's $1 billion worth of drought loans of up to $2 million, with no repayments and no interest for the first two years to make it cheaper for farmers to buy fodder, transport stock, build water infrastructure, agist cattle, mend fences and refinance their existing debts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see those opposite don't appear to be so interested in what the government is doing to respond to the needs of Australians when they need it. They were here for the performance and the theatrics of the member for Shortland, but they have disappeared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government, in conjunction with the South Australian government, has struck a deal to secure 100 gigalitres of water that farmers can buy at a discounted rate if they are going to contribute to growing fodder with that water—120,000 tonnes of fodder, to help those drought affected communities get back onto their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, Australia has suffered from bushfires, and I have joined the Prime Minister in visiting individuals and communities that have been affected. This government has stepped up. This government has made responsible spending decisions to support those communities—not just those communities that are directly affected, but those communities and those economies that are also broadly affected in our economy. We take this job and this role very seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $76 million to support the tourism recovery package, to encourage domestic and international tourism, to protect those jobs and small businesses in those economies right around Australia. There's an initial $100 million for a national clean-up package to assist those areas impacted by fire with site-clearing costs on all residences and commercial properties, with a fifty-fifty sharing arrangement with the affected states. There's $40 million to directly help the great work of those volunteer organisations like the Salvation Army Property Trust and St Vincent de Paul, who have been providing services in these communities. There's $10 million to deliver the financial counselling that is required in these communities. There's $100 million to provide grants of up to $75,000 to primary producers to deal with their immediate needs.</span>

                  </a>  While I hear some of those opposite yawn while I go through these support mechanisms that we're putting in place to support these communities, this is not something that we should disrespect—particularly funding like $2 million to Lifeline and, in particular, Kids Helpline; there's $8 million for back-to-school mental health. These communities that have been affected in these areas need the support that this government can give them, and we can only give them support, without introducing things like flood levies, because of the strong economic and fiscal management that this government presides over.</span>

                  </a>  knowing that the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Health and other members of the National Security Committee were in the cabinet room discussing Australia's response to the coronavirus, were playing political parlour games and distracting those ministers and the Prime Minister from doing their job of keeping Australians safe. Shame on you! Spending decisions will come as we respond to the health and economic needs of Australians in responding to the coronavirus, and this government will stand ready, because we are strong economic and fiscal managers of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to share with you some of the areas that I am most excited about. In my responsibility as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I lead our government's deregulation agenda. As part of that, I'm responsible for the Office of Best Practice Regulation, and we have made some announcements recently in relation to the regulatory impact analysis framework, and I'm going to share those with you today. The regulatory impact statement, or RIS, process helps the government navigate the complex policy challenges where there are changes in the behaviour of businesses or individuals. These RISs, or the impact analysis settings, allow us to make sure that we are making decisions that are fit for purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made decisions to simplify the process for policymakers. The previous four categories of the regulatory impact statements will be condensed into one, with the level of analysis to be proportionate to the magnitude of the problem and the potential impacts. To ensure the effort put in by agencies is more accurately recognised, there will be four levels of quality assessment: insufficient, fit for purpose, good practice and exemplary. They should all aim for exemplary; that is what our expectation is of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure the focus on regulatory costs doesn't come at the expense of understanding economic and competition impacts of new proposals, agencies will still be required to include the regulatory or red tape costs in a RIS. However, the Office of Best Practice Regulation will no longer be required to agree to these costs in isolation. We will also task the Office of Best Practice Regulation, which oversees the government's RIA settings, to assess independent reviews, which can substitute for regulatory impact statements, for relevance to the problem and the recommended policy option. Well-designed, well-targeted, limited and fit-for-purpose regulation supports the government to deliver our agenda and priorities effectively. While those opposite might not be interested in the regulatory impact statements that are so important to better decision-making in government, this government is committed to making sure that these processes are fit for purpose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy of those opposite knows no bounds. We're asked about government spending. I refer you to the Auditor-General's report that found that when the Labor leader, the member for Grayndler, was administering programs as infrastructure minister, he disproportionately gave money to Labor seats. The ANAO report in 2011 found ministers waived the eligibility criteria for projects funded by Labor's Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, and that a number of projects in coalition seats did not get funding. The ANAO report reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... whilst the majority of applications received related to projects located in a Coalition held electorate (55 per cent of all applications), the significant majority (some 82 per cent) of these were not approved for funding…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… whilst 40.3 per cent of all applications related to a project in an ALP held electorate, just under 60 per cent of approved projects were in an ALP held electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also found that Mr Albanese's own office had set out the projects by electorate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the data originally provided by the department, two new columns were added to the worksheet to identify the electorate in which the project was located, and the political party that held that electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the report said. The hypocrisy of those opposite knows no bounds. On days when the parliament and the Prime Minister are dealing with issues relating to the safety of Australians, those opposite play political parlour games in this House as opposed to allowing the government to get on with the business of government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  It's great to see that the government's defence of its sports rorts program fundamentally comes down to, 'Somebody else did it too!' Putting aside the fact that everything you just said is wrong, your defence effectively amounts to, 'Other people have done it.' You're admitting your own problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what this MPI boils down to. It is really interesting to see that the minister opposite at the table has decided to oppose, effectively, a proposition that government should apply the highest standards of due process and probity to its spending decisions. He's then gone on and proceeded to rattle off a number of spending amounts in programs, the majority of which are very meritorious. In fact, the sports program, when you read it as a headline number and what they were supposed to be funding, is very meritorious, but the projects that were funded were not meritorious. That's the fundamental program that we've got. In fact, some of them were not even eligible to receive the funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to this point because the member opposite did. He talks about the very significant and important funding that is going to support those in need of drought relief and fire relief. It is important that those funds are allocated; it is important that those funds are there. But what's actually important is that the funds flow to the people who need them. I have met and spoken with those businesses affected by the bushfires in the Blue Mountains and elsewhere in New South Wales. I have found that businesses that need access to loan funds to get through this period where they've had a decline in their business—as tourists are not going to those areas—are not getting the help that they need. They're not getting the money from the government. It's taking weeks for applications to even be acknowledged. Then further information is required. That money is not flowing to those people. It's great that you mentioned a headline figure. We completely support that idea. But, when it comes to due process and making sure that the money does what it's designed to do, you're not actually delivering on that for the Australian people. We want to see that system work, but it's not happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the high standards that we would expect, it's not just 'we' the opposition; it's 'we' the Australian people. We want to see not only transparent guidelines and a fair process but also decision-makers following those guidelines. There's an idea! How about ministers accept the advice about programs, not only that they're meritorious—that'd be a good start—but that they're actually eligible for the money that is supposed to be flowing to those organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding sports rorts 1—and isn't it amazing that we have to give version numbers now because we're into multiple sports rorts under this government—the $100,000 Community Sport Infrastructure Grants Program which was supposed to be assessed meritoriously and was supposed to help community sports programs around the country, I just want to read some of the observations that the ANAO made, because it's really, really important:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Minister's Office used the spreadsheets ... to undertake a parallel assessment process as a basis for the Minister deciding which projects should be funded with additional analysis on 'marginal' electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates not held by the Coalition that were to be 'targeted' in the 2019 Election …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to looking at guidelines and meritorious programs and making sure that people receive the benefit of the doubt, I elucidate this from the submission of the City of Gosnells in the electorate of Burt, my electorate, for a program that they applied for—a program that was ranked in the top 50 meritorious sport grants by Sport Australia—which did not receive money because of decisions made by this government. This should ring in your ears. The city's application presented over 17 pages of information and six supporting documents. It's estimated the application took over 80 hours to prepare. The City of Gosnells does give you the benefit of the doubt, government, because they say they 'understand that the federal minister may apply some discretion in decision-making. However, if funding bodies require detailed and professional applications, the City would expect professional and objective decision-making.' Well, it appears that, under this government, the only objective of their decision-making was to rort the system so that they could see themselves win an election and return to power. That was the only objective that was being pursued, and not just by the sports minister at the time but, quite clearly, by the Prime Minister's office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you've got 136 emails in six months about this program, when you are seeking approval from the Prime Minister about where money will be allocated the day before the election and then approval is given after the election is called, it's a rort.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Road Safety and Freight Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  It's a great pleasure to speak on the matter of public importance today, where the opposition have highlighted the need for the government to apply the highest standards of due process and probity in spending decisions. There is no greater probity and oversight than we have in road safety and some of the programs that I have direct oversight of. Road safety is such an important part. It's one of the rare issues that have bipartisan support in this place. Throughout each of the states in this country, there is a road safety committee set up which is chaired by a government member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it in context: roughly, each committee would have a member from each state police jurisdiction and it would have, more than likely, someone from the Local Government Association. In every situation, you would have a royal automobile club represented on that body. Then you've got the fringe groups that could potentially be there, ranging from parents and friends associations, bicycle associations, pedestrian associations and motorcycle associations. They scatter through. They look over a period of matrixes to offer a list of where government funding should be prioritised. That level of probity and that level of consideration and consultation with the public is how I conduct road safety programs in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have a $4.5 billion program called Roads of Strategic Importance, with just under $2 million of that quarantined for northern Australia. We have done, again, some of the most comprehensive consultation right across the top of northern Australia, and as we speak there are—as there were last week—further consultation processes with regional councils along the primary corridors that we have identified. We want to make sure that we park these significant investments into the next decade in the places they are most needed, and in order to do that we throw a wide net when we're sourcing where the priorities are. We throw that wide net with our partners, with local government, with communities, and with stakeholders like the construction and the engineering firms, to make sure that we get those investments right. And it's not an infinite bucket, but we do try to make sure that we have a process where—</span>

                  </a>  Absolutely—colour-coded. They're my favourites! I want to bring up, in the few minutes left for me to speak, the opening comments of the good member for Burt, where he referred to a sports program as a 'rort'. He referred to it as a 'rort'. I thought that was a little unfair, given that we have such high integrity on this side of the House and given that I've highlighted a number of programs that we have conducted with the highest integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to help out those opposite. I want to help out, so listen closely. Bring your ear to the microphone, I say. We have this thing called the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which detects, disrupts and deters corrupt conduct in Australian law enforcement agencies. So, if you think that there's a case to be heard, consider making a complaint to them. The Australian Federal Police also works with partner agencies across the Commonwealth to respond to serious and complex corruption offences, including fraud and bribery. So, if it's a serious offence, that's a place where you could park your concerns. There's the National Audit Office, which scrutinises the exercise of authority by the government. There's also the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which considers and investigates complaints by people who believe they have been treated unfairly by Australian government departments. And, of course, there's the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would suggest that none of those agencies that I just referred to are going to hear a word from those on the other side, because they know that this government is of the highest integrity, and we run our programs with integrity, exactly as they all deserve.</span>

In Jagajaga, we've got more than 100 sporting clubs. We love our sports. Every time I am out and about, people tell me how busy they are caring for their club and playing on a Saturday—and how they need new facilities and how they're stretched and how they need some funding support. Do you know what the Greensborough Hockey Club did through the Nillumbik shire? They applied for some funding support. They applied for some funding support through a now-famous funding sports grants program. They were rated by Sport Australia as quite deserving of this funding. In fact, they received 89 out of 100.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, they did. The Greensborough Hockey Club, a great hockey club run by some great people, were found to be very deserving of their new pavilion—$500,000. Now, imagine their surprise when they didn't receive this money. And we now know why they didn't receive this money. They didn't receive this money because this government is more interested in rorting, it's more interested in playing political games with taxpayer funds, than it is in supporting local sporting clubs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got a direct contrast here, in fact. A constituent of mine called my office late in January. His son played for the Toorak East Malvern Hockey Club. They share a facility with the Hawthorn Hockey Club in the wealthy, leafy electorate of Kooyong next door. This, of course, is the Treasurer's seat.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, my constituent is quite involved in the affairs of the Toorak East Malvern Hockey Club. On 26 April last year, during the caretaker period, he received an email from this club's leadership. He, along with all the other teams and players, received this email inviting him along to an 'urgent additional training event' that night. They were told to wear their full club uniforms. When they got there, it was for a photo-op with their local member, the member for Kooyong, who announced $500,000 for a club pavilion redevelopment—during the caretaker period. There you go! So, Greensborough Hockey Club rated 89 out of 100—no funding. Next door in Kooyong—$500,000. Do you know what they were rated by Sport Australia?</span>

A process is set up and there's work done under that process—to rate these clubs, to look at what's needed, who's doing the work, where clubs need extra support—and that's thrown out the window by this government. A very wealthy part of Melbourne, where facilities are, as this club member said, already 'first-class', receives funding.

That's why my constituents are ringing up my office and telling me, 'This stinks!' They know and the people who are members of this club know that what that government is doing is wrong. They thought they were getting a leader. Instead, they've got a marketing man spending taxpayers' money outside the rules with no probity and no proper process. And when he's called out on it, what's the response? Is he looking at how he might raise standards? Is he thinking about how people are a bit disappointed with him and that he could do better? No, none of this. Instead, he points across the room and he says, 'It's okay, because that guy over there did it first.' Well, that's not the case, but what a response! I think we all found out in grade 1 that pointing out across the room and saying, 'Mum, I was just copying him!' is not an excuse. You're the Prime Minister. Have some standards. Get some guts. Do it right. Follow the process. Australians expect that of you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to debate this particular MPI today because it gives a perfect example of what this side of the House—the government—is focused on this week versus what Labor members are focused on. What have the Labor members been focused on this week? Playing silly parliamentary games. They probably had a few other things on. I'm sure the member for Hunter probably went for dinner at Otis at some point during the week, as did a bunch of other Labor members. But mostly the Labor members have been focused on political games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have the government members on this side of the chamber been doing? We have been focused on the Australian people. We've been delivering the spending commitments that deliver on their priorities: dealing with the drought, dealing with fire recovery, dealing the coronavirus response, establishing flexible parental leave, helping to lower electricity prices, helping to keep our borders strong, lowering taxes, listing new PBS medicines. We know how to take proper spending decisions with due process and probity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't take lectures from the Labor members opposite on due process and probity when it comes to spending decisions. Do they all have such a short memory that they don't remember the last time they were in government? Cash for clunkers, cheques for dead people, pink batts, school hall funding that didn't actually deliver school halls in particular schools. Is that Labor's idea of due process and probity when it comes to spending decisions? I suspect it is. And while that's Labor's idea of good spending priorities, it's certainly not this government's idea of it. But do you know what? Let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's not talk about the last time they were in government. Let's talk about these members and what they are doing right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced the ensuring integrity bill into this place—a bill to ensure that registered organisations do the right thing and work for their members to make sure registered organisations, like unions, practice due process and probity exactly like this government. What did the Labor members do? They ran a protection racket for them. 'Unions shouldn't have to meet those high standards. No, no, no. Government has to, but unions definitely shouldn't!' It went to the Senate, and Labor's Senator Glenn Sterle said this: 'We should not be rushing legislation to try and prosecute union officials who have to break the law sometimes to get an outcome.' Let me just say that again: 'who have to break the law sometimes to get an outcome'. What kind of laws are they breaking? Well, they're probably around due process when it comes to spending decisions. But, more than that, the type of laws they're talking about breaking to get an outcome are coercion, bullying, intimidation, unlawful strikes, unlawful accesses, stoppages, and spitting on and assaulting female police officers. This stuff is disgraceful. Labor members opposite run a protection racket and then pretend to lecture this government on integrity. Well, no, we're not copping a bar of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They could've come in here and talked about the priorities that Australians and Australian families have like this government does every day and that we are acting on every day. But instead they choose to play their silly political games. The hypocrisy is absolutely galling because, as we have heard previously from the member for Tangney, who pointed this out, they are talking out of the other side of their mouth. The member for Ballarat presided over Labor's local grants program. The Auditor-General found out that she approved projects against the recommendations of experts. But it's unfair of members on this side of the chamber to single out the member for Ballarat, because she's in great company, holding hands with, of course, the member for Grayndler, who was minister for infrastructure at the time. Let's see if this rings any bells when I read from the Audit Office report for the Labor members opposite. This is what the Audit Office had to say about the now Leader of the Opposition:</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  My electorate of Parramatta does not have a swimming pool. We had one, but the state government ripped it out of the ground to build something else. Years later, we've just been through the hottest summer on record without a pool. We're 60 per cent born overseas. Many of the people in my electorate, including the children, were raised in places where swimming lessons were not an option. There are adults who can't swim and teenagers who can't swim, and we have lost our pool. They applied under what is known as the 'community sports program', better known as the 'sports rorts program', and they got 83 out of 100 when assessed by the department. They were No. 16 on the list, and were they funded? No, because this government has rorted the process. The corruption of the process is appalling. If you look at the figures, 73 per cent of the projects that were funded were not on the list that came from the department. Forty-three per cent of them weren't even eligible, yet my electorate and its swimming pool—No. 16—are not even there. It's gone. There is no funding for a community in extraordinary need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has stood up in this place and said, 'Ah, but it was within the rules.' Now, let's leave aside that it wasn't within the rules. The National Audit Office clearly says it wasn't. Anyone with half a brain can see that it wasn't in the rules. But let's assume for a minute that it was. When you get to be the Prime Minister and you're the prime rule-maker, you do not get to use the rules as a shield. If what you want to do is unethical, if it's not the best use of taxpayers' money and it's in the rules, then you change the rules because that's your job. Your job as the Prime Minister is to make sure that taxpayers' money is well spent. If what this government did is within the rules, then you should be slammed for not changing them, quite frankly. This is not okay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the only place in which the Parramatta pool was ignored. It's not the only one. There was another fund which has come to light now, which is the $150 million female facilities and water safety stream program. Again, many organisations in my electorate don't have female change rooms for their state top 10 rugby teams or cricket teams at all. Let's leave that aside. We also don't have a swimming pool, and yet the guidelines for this program weren't even released. However, $60 million, or 40 per cent of the program's funding, was spent in two Liberal-held seats and 80 per cent of it—even though it was a regional program—was spent in city electorates on swimming pools but not in Parramatta. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parramatta wouldn't have applied for it, because the guidelines weren't even released. The guidelines weren't released, and Parramatta is not in a region so it wouldn't have even been in the page of projects to be assessed. This is done behind closed doors within electorates that the government wishes to win. Based on a wink, wink, nudge, nudge: 'Apply for this; you'll get the money.' How is that fair? How could that possibly be in any set of rules that any reasonable, responsible government set? How could that possibly be okay? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is taxpayers' money, and the process that you set in place should be transparent, it should be public, it should be known and it should be fair. And neither of these programs were anything like that. This is: 'We, the government, will use taxpayers' money to get ourselves elected.' That is clearly what it is. When the vast majority of money is going to marginal seats that the coalition are targeting, then that is what is happening. When money is being spent behind closed doors and the vast majority of electorates that aren't Liberal-held electorates don't even know it's going to be spent, that is a government that is using taxpayers' money to get itself elected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say that this government is corrupt—I can't say that in this place, and I won't—but this process is corrupt. If this process is within the rules, then have a hard look at yourselves because you are lousy rule-makers. I'll say it again: if you're the rule-maker, you don't get to hide behind the rules. You made the rules. If what you're doing is unethical and is not the best use of taxpayers' money, then change the rules and set the rules right now so that it can't happen again. This is outrageous. My pool and my community have lost out because of the rort and the corrupting of the process by this bunch of heaven-knows-what on the other side of the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I think it's interesting that the Labor Party are in here claiming the moral high ground when it comes to standards of due process and probity, but their own record tells a very different story. You only need to look at where they stand on law-breaking unions. There are a number of significant infrastructure projects rolling out in the northern Tasmanian community in Bass, and we can't afford for rogue unions to affect their rollout. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure spending is proving to be a key creator of jobs, a driver of business confidence and a means to support an ever-growing community with diverse needs. In my electorate of Bass, just some of the millions of dollars committed to my fantastic community include the northern suburbs community hub—a $15 million investment which will include offices for community organisations and provide pathways for employment and recreational opportunities for young people; the Beauty Point master plan—$3 million towards a project spearheaded by the West Tamar Council to drive tourism growth; or the UTAS redevelopment—the federal government is investing $160 million into the relocation of the University of Tasmania to its new location at Inveresk. It is the single-largest infrastructure project in our city's history and it will create more than 800 jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite what Labor would have us believe, we know that some unions are disruptive and engage in behaviour that is detrimental to those that they claim to represent and their communities. In fact, Master Builders Australia estimates that union lawlessness can add up to 30 per cent to the cost of our vital infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals. Just last week I met with a significant number of construction workers in my community. I noted their excitement in regard to the growth of industry in the region. That's why the government's ensuring integrity bill is so important. Nobody is above the law, and that includes registered unions and employer groups. To be very clear, I have no problem with unions if they are operating in the manner in which they are intended to. I expect them to act in the best interests of their members and obey the law, which most do. However, I certainly support cleaning up the ones that don't, and that's what this bill is designed to do. The bill would introduce additional deterrents into the law to prevent the sort of repeated serious and damaging law-breaking engaged in by a militant minority of registered organisations and their officials and ensure that the courts are able to take appropriate and effective action in response to this sort of law-breaking.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in case you need some reminding, the Heydon royal commission also uncovered numerous examples of flagrant disregard for the law by some registered organisations and their officers; and a culture of lawlessness, which is not new and has been exposed for over 30 years and continues to make national headlines. For instance, over $17.2 million in penalties have been handed down by the courts against the CFMMEU and its representatives for over 2,000 contraventions of the law. That is just in cases brought by the building industry watchdog and its predecessors. This law-breaking includes bullying; harassing and intimidating workers who exercise their right not to join a union, including stopping them from being able to work at all; intimidating public servants, including work health and safety inspectors, fair work inspectors, building inspectors and a female police officer; and coercing businesses through industrial lawfare tactics, including those which put workers in danger. We won't sit back and do nothing, as those opposite are wont to do, which is perhaps understandable on their account when you consider that almost $14 million was pumped into the Labor coffers by unions in 2018-19. However, those of us in government actually recognise—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I was speaking fairly loudly! The courts need other options to ensure that the repeated law-breaking engaged in by this militant minority is stopped. It is very important to note that there's nothing in the bill that will prevent a registered organisation from exercising its rights to represent workers, including investigating underpayment issues or acting on work health and safety concerns, but, for the protection of workers in our communities and the integrity of unions, this bill is essential. Those opposite claim that what this MPI boils down to is integrity— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Fancy defending a position that the government have on integrity and accountability with a bill that they didn't allow any accountability for in this place, the ensuring integrity bill. Do they even listen to themselves speak? It is absolutely astounding that the government would use that as a defence of this sports rorts scandal. This stinks. The sports rorts scandal stinks and the fish rots from the head. Over there, with their born-to-rule attitude, they are very happy turning taxpayer funds into the Liberal Party coffers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've done this before. In an area that is underfunded in this country, the arts, years and years ago George Brandis took money out of the Australia Council and put it into the Catalyst fund. The thing that everyone knew was that only George Brandis could decide where that funding went. Instead of having an independent oversight agency that actually helped fund cultural policy in this country, George Brandis wanted his own slush fund for the arts in this country. It was a disgrace. It has decimated the industry and cost jobs. We as Australians are lesser for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to know about the character of those opposite, especially the man who sits in the chair up the front, you only have to look at the character they displayed during the bushfires over summer. When our country needed leadership, what they got was a Liberal Party ad. When our country needed leadership, the Prime Minister said, 'Australians, you should donate to the Liberal Party for our bushfires.' And instead of having accountability and oversight for $100 million—$100 million of taxpayer funds—they turned the bushfires into a Liberal Party ad and they've turned taxpayer dollars into a Labor Party slush fund. That's what this government does.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go into the resignation of Bridget McKenzie. Senator McKenzie resigned over the $100 million sports rorts scandal. But she didn't resign for the reasons she should have resigned. She resigned because apparently she forgot to declare that she was a member of a gun club. But the reason she should have resigned is all the reasons that are being drip-fed out right now—that this process was corrupt, that this process stinks and that the $100 million of taxpayer funds used by those opposite were for Liberal Party purposes. That's why Senator McKenzie should have resigned, and that's why those opposite I'm sure are taking a good, hard long look at the Prime Minister right now, who couldn't reveal any details during question time because he knows that he is in strife. That man is under pressure, and we all know it in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In McNamara we have some outstanding local sporting clubs, and at Caulfield Park, under the governance of the Glen Eira City Council, we are absolutely chockers. There is not an inch of that park that doesn't get used. We have over 20 soccer teams on a waiting list to get into that park. We have so many clubs who are sharing that facility. It is a community facility, and of course the Glen Eira council, along with all of the sporting clubs, put in an application, and this story has been told. But let's have a guess of the rating that the Glen Eira council received.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I'm happy to speak on this motion: the need for the government to apply the highest standards of due process and probity to spending decisions. The Australian government is obliged to provide the highest standards of due process and probity to spending decisions and service delivery because we're caretakers in the expenditure of the public's money. We must account as MPs to all our constituents. I have 125,000. I represent Cowper, and I'm ensuring that their taxes are well spent and managed with a great degree of probity and care. We, as MPs, also need to report to them so that they receive their fair share and that this government's services meets their needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison-McCormack government does this by taking a multiagency approach to combat corruption. These agencies have specialised roles and responsibilities in deterring, detecting and responding to corruption. The key word here is responsibility—the ability to respond and enforce with authority, and consistently apply these highest standards. These institutions are designed for governance—important governance. They include parliamentary committees, government departments, independent statutory authorities and law enforcement agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, for example, detects, deters and disrupts corrupt conduct in Australian law enforcement agencies. In recent times, I went to New Zealand and Vanuatu on a delegation and examined those countries' measures in enforcing their laws to deter corruption. I take this opportunity to welcome the new commissioner, Ms Jaala Hinchcliffe. I'm told her appointment comes at a key time for the commission. One investigation Ms Hinchcliffe will undertake is the examination of the alleged potential corruption through Crown Resorts and the home affairs department. Starting work on this high-profile case shows that Ms Hinchcliffe means business in upholding probity and integrity in government to benefit all Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Australian Federal Police, which partners with the state agencies across the Commonwealth in response to serious and complex corruption offences, which also includes fraud and foreign bribery. One recent high-profile case that the AFP worked on in conjunction with the military inspector-general was investigating Australian soldiers' actions in Afghanistan to ensure the laws of combat were upheld. I'll take this opportunity to thank all current and ex-service men and women for their service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Australian National Audit Office, which scrutinises financial management and the expenditure of public funds by the executive arm of the government. Plus there is the Commonwealth Ombudsman, who considers and investigates complaints for people who believe they have been treated unfairly by the Australian government. And, of course, there is the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, commissioned to audit, advise and report on expenses of parliamentarians and their staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The multiagency approach to combat corruption has proven successful. Australia consistently ranks as a low-corruption jurisdiction. It is generally accepted that there is no evidence of systematic or endemic integrity issues in the federal public sector. The government is firmly committed to ensuring the federal integrity framework is as strong as possible to maximise public confidence in our national institutions. In keeping with this, the government has committed to establishing the Commonwealth Integrity Commission, or CIC, to enhance national integrity arrangements across the federal public sector. It will include a public sector integrity division and a law enforcement integrity division, ensuring targeted attention to corruption and fraud across the whole public sector. Through the CIC, the government will have the ability to target serious criminal corruption that presents a threat to good public administration. All of these commissions and institutions are complex and sensitive in the investigations that they carry— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Labor supports these changes in principle. Implemented well, they will make the social security system more accurate and eventually make it easier for people to report their income. This bill is now returning from the Senate after two Labor amendments were successful. The first amendment was a 12-month review of these changes. This is important to ensure implementation is done properly and that the government gets this right, because we simply don't trust them to get it right without scrutiny. The second amendment which was successful will ensure that income is attributed over fair and reasonable social security reporting periods that won't disadvantage social security recipients. It will prevent any kind of deliberate averaging strategy that will leave social security recipients worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, a third Labor amendment to once and for all end robodebt was not successful. My colleague the member for Maribyrnong will expand on this. The Liberal government was given a choice: pensioners or another robodebt. They chose robodebt. And, as I said, the member for Maribyrnong will expand on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For three long, anxious and frightful years, the Liberal government pursued thousands of innocent Australians with false or inflated debts. For three years, this Liberal government defended a system that it knew to be illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the debate of this bill, Labor proposed measures to protect our pensioners, workers and students from another occurrence of the government's robodebt scheme. I remember when news first broke of this disastrous and terrifying robodebt scheme. I remember the first constituents who contacted my office, some of whom we are still assisting to this day. We were contacted by thousands of frightened Australians from all over the country, and this happened in everyone's office. Many were constituents from government electorates. These were pensioners, workers and students, driven to their wits' end by this cruel and malicious government. Many were simply too scared to challenge these false debts—so scared that they gave up and gave in, even though the government was plain wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill, Labor had proposed some very simple, practical and reasonable amendments to ensure that the Liberals' disastrous robodebt scheme never occurred again. All we asked was that the government take some responsibility and ensure oversight and human intervention to prevent another robodebt. They voted down the amendment. In so doing, the government refused to prevent social security debts being raised solely on income averaging. It was this income averaging that led the government into error in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government refuses to accept the statutory duty of care to ensure debts are accurate. Why is it so controversial for the government to accept this duty of care? The government refuses to ensure human oversight over debts before they are issued. Why is this so much to ask of the government—to ask for human oversight? The government even refuses to use all available powers, resources and data at its disposal to verify the accuracy of the alleged debts. The government wants to go out there and send out social security debts to some of the most vulnerable people in this country, and yet it won't stand by the accuracy or veracity of these debts. The government has demonised pensioners, workers and students, and that is simply unacceptable. But, in voting down Labor's practicable and reasonable anti-robodebt measure, the Liberals now place pensioners, workers and students at risk of another robodebt. They deserve better from this government and this Prime Minister. 130,000 Australian workers are either not earning enough income or not receiving enough hours of work to get off Newstart. They deserve better. The thousands of students working hard and studying hard, the members of Australia's future workforce—they deserve better. For the tens of thousands of innocent Australians who have been subjected to the terror and anxiety of the Liberal government's robodebt scheme, they need to know that the government will be better than this. In reality, the Liberal government is refusing to rule out another robodebt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, two of Labor's amendments were accepted: the review and the 'fair and reasonable' social security reporting periods. However, the third and most important of our amendments was not accepted, and I know that we'll be hearing more about this. The government has chosen the potential for another robodebt crisis, and it was a crisis, particularly for those people that were victims of robodebt.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Labor will support the bill because it's an attempt to try and make data collection more accurate and to make sure that Australians get the safety net entitlements that they deserve. But we've got to recognise that our vote for this is more a triumph of hope over experience. This is the government who, when it introduced new technology, gave us the My Health Record. That was a flop. We had the 2019 myGov outage, with technical difficulties that brought down the entire online government service portal for a day. There was, of course, Michael McCormack's one job, the census of 2016. That didn't end so well. But the king of all digi-disasters has been robodebt. So, whilst we support the recording of more accurate information through this legislation, our expectations of this incompetent, bungling government to execute it, I think, are an attempt at hope over our long-lived experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But robodebt is what has prompted this legislation. We are surprised and disappointed that, in the Senate, the government voted against just relying on the averaging of ATO data over a year to determine whether or not a particular fortnight's benefit to a Centrelink recipient is valid. That is the cause of the robodebt problem, and this stubborn government still can't admit its fault. But, for the education and edification of government members, the robodebt issue is a real issue: 600,000-plus notices were sent out by the government on the basis that it had the power to do so when, in fact, it didn't. How on earth did we get to a state of affairs in this nation where the government sends a letter of demand to hundreds of thousands of Australians but it doesn't have the legal authority to do so? How on earth did we get to a set of circumstances where no-one is responsible for this mistake? This is not a mistake which is victim-free. Thousands of Australians—tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands—feel the stigma, the humiliation and the desperation to try and find money that the government asserts it overpaid them when, in fact, the government didn't even have the right to ask for the overpayment—or, indeed, refund—which, in many cases, wasn't valid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government who conducted hundreds of thousands of transactions with its own citizens when they didn't have the legal power to do it. Wake up, government members! Are you so arrogant and so hubristic with the rorts that you committed before the last election that you can't even own making a mistake? Once upon a time, ministers would have resigned if their departments had acted illegally against hundreds of thousands of their citizens to unjustly enrich themselves. And if the government members who haven't bothered to acquaint themselves with the robodebt scandal think that words like 'unjust enrichment' are an exaggeration, they're not. The government's lawyers concede there was enrichment. But what is truly remarkable is—having broken the law, having put hundreds of thousands of citizens through a process that they were never meant to be subjected to, was unfair and caused harm—the defence that the government lawyers are using to justify the illegal actions and to justify not repaying the money—that is, that they don't owe a duty of care to Centrelink recipients. This is a morally bankrupt government. It's a government that lied and cheated at the last election, in terms of the rorts we're hearing about. And now they don't even care about their duty of care to their own citizens. Shame on the lot of you!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I want to pay tribute to and express my support for the local businesses in Hurstville in the electorate of Barton. I am proud that the electorate of Barton is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in Australia. It is home to one of the largest Chinese communities in Australia. Barton reflects the face of modern Australia. As we all know, this is an anxious and difficult time for our Chinese community. Many of our local businesses have taken a pretty hard hit, and many of our local residents have been subjected to unacceptable racist sentiments and comments. As many have said before, the coronavirus does not discriminate, and neither should we. We are all in this together. I want to take this opportunity to put my remarks on the record in this parliament that we stand with you. We are here for you. And we are going to get through this together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfolding situation around the world has seen fear and misinformation spread in our community, especially through social media. I strongly encourage everyone to keep themselves informed of the facts through the Commonwealth Department of Health and the New South Wales Health websites. These materials are also available in Chinese. As the Prime Minister said moments ago, you can still go to the footy match, you can still go to the rock concert and you can still go to your favourite Chinese restaurant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks, I and the Labor member for Kogarah, Chris Minns; the Labor mayor for Georges River, Kevin Greene; the New South Wales Leader of the Opposition, Jodie McKay; and Jason Yat-Sen Li have been visiting and dining in some of our local businesses in Hurstville, including Sunny Harbour Seafood, Yu Star BBQ, Diamond Cafe and Bakery, Taste of Shanghai, 18 Grams cafe and Kalotfuk Supermarket. We hope to get around to many more in the coming weeks with other colleagues. We've talked about the difficulties that people are facing, the impact that recent months have had on their businesses, and it has been extreme. We've also gone to show our support and stand with the Chinese community in this extremely difficult time. And this isn't just having an impact on businesses. It also means that workers are having shifts cut and unemployment is growing. It means that children in schoolyards are experiencing very, very confronting situations. The wider community has also certainly felt it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to encourage people to come out to visit and support the many amazing and wonderful local businesses in the Hurstville district. We take these restaurants and grocers and other local businesses for granted, and we shouldn't—and we won't in the future. They have become an important staple in modern Australian cuisine. They have become an institution in suburbs and cities all over Australia. In the electorate of Barton, they go to the very character of suburbs like Hurstville. But right now they really need our support and our patronage to keep them going into the future. So, again, I want to say to the businesses and restaurants and entrepreneurs in the Hurstville area, particularly those in the Chinese community: we stand with you. And 'Hurstville eats' will continue; I will be visiting Hurstville in the very near future with other members of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there is an enormous amount of fear. I really, once again, encourage people very strongly to look at the official websites of the Commonwealth Department of Health and New South Wales Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have the most up-to-date information on the virus. They have accurate information. Much of the fear that's been spread around is to the detriment of the very, very brave people who are continuing to go into their restaurants to try and make ends meet. We have been told by a number of restaurant owners that their businesses have fallen by up to 75 per cent. It's not an exaggeration. Hurstville is normally a bustling suburb. It has a very big train station and it has a Westfield there. I was there last Saturday, I think, and it certainly isn't the bustling place that it used to be. Once again, I really encourage people to think about this virus. It does not discriminate and neither should we. We are all in this together. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  As at 1 January, regional airports throughout Australia are required to have full passenger screening scanners in airports that operate aircraft with a seating capacity in excess of 40 and with more than 30,000 passenger movements a year. I support these measures, it must be said. The government doesn't make these decisions lightly. It's on the best advice that our security agents are giving us that aircraft of a certain size can become a target of terrorists because they can be used as a projectile weapon. Fully loaded with fuel, there is a certain level where they believe that they become a real risk. These scanners will be installed around a number of airports around Australia. Some have them already; others will need more sophisticated equipment. The government has said that they will pay for the capital costs of installation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, since it was first mooted, I've had serious concerns about the effect that it may have on a number of smaller airports where the ability to defray fixed operating costs over a limited number of passengers can have quite a severe impact. To give you some idea, there are a number of different aircraft operators around Australia, but many residents in much of regional Australia are serviced by either QantasLink or Rex Airlines or both. In the case of Rex Airlines, their SAAB aircraft have less than 40-seat capacity, so any airport that is operating Rex only will not be affected. Their passengers will not be screened. For any airport that is operating Qantas only, while they have a fleet of smaller aircraft—certainly in my part of the world they are using Q400s, which have a seating capacity well in excess of 40—they will, of course, be swept up in this regulation. Where you have both aircraft operating, then it is going to be a decision of the airport operator as to where the extra landing costs will go. I can tell you that a thought that's been proposed to me is that maybe councils should pick up the extra tab.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a report here from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development. They used Whyalla as a case study. That's one of the airports that I'm most concerned about. Whyalla has a throughput of 82,000 passengers a year. That would indicate that 41,000—because you're only screened on outbound flights—will need to be screened. For Whyalla Airport, it's estimated the cost per passenger will be $69.50 if they screen just the Qantas passengers and $53.90 if they screen all passengers, because the costs go up. The bottom line is that, to screen all those passengers—just 40,000—will cost about $2 million a year. That's a cost that will be put onto all regional airports around Australia that require scanning. Some of them already have scanning, as I said, so the lift will not be great. But it's the kind of cost that I don't think these airports could stand. We know, for instance, that the operators in that space are already under great pressure. Only a couple of weeks ago, Rex Airlines announced that they were no longer carrying through to Kangaroo Island, leaving Qantas as the only supplier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />There have been some suggestions that maybe the aircraft operators—and, in most cases, that is the council—can pick up the tab. I asked the Whyalla City Council how much money they were making out of operating Whyalla Airport. It turns out that last year they lost $186,000, and this year they've budgeted for a $175,000 loss. So there's not a lot of sauce on the plate there to skim off. The airport's already operating at a loss. They can't stand extra costs. I am really, really concerned that one or two of the carriers may well pull out. If, for instance, Qantas pulled out, then we could pull the scanners out and stack them out the back of the airport, because then we wouldn't need them for the Rex flights. It's putting great pressure on the airport operators, who are trying to work out whether they should be putting the landing fees on all aircraft or just on the aircraft that are over 40 seats. This is bringing a real imbalance to the decision-making process. I'm still hopeful that we are going to see some movement on this from the government. I ask that all members consider it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  On Australia Day I announced the winners of the 21st Annual Griffith Australia Day Awards, a tradition started by my predecessor as member for Griffith and former Prime Minister the Hon. Kevin Rudd. Each of the wonderful people who received an award this year has made an enduring contribution to our community as a volunteer, seeking neither financial reward nor recognition. Suzanne Bosanquet, from the Gabba Business Association, has been a leader in that group and has also been involved with a number of grassroots organisations and impressive projects in the Woolloongabba community. Kerry Schilling, founder of Kerry's Wildlife Rescue &amp; Care centre, rescues and cares for animals and provides advice to others regarding injured wildlife. The dedicated founding members of the South Brisbane Men's Shed have realised their vision for a men's shed that supports fathers and male relatives of kids with autism. Darren Godwell has done extensive, varied and transformational work with First Nations people and with the West End community and beyond—nationally, at a state level and locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Evans OAM dedicates six days a week to caring for the environment with the group he founded, SCRUB Catchment Care Group, and with B4C, the Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee. Greg Kerswell has kept the Bulimba Book Club alive for more than a decade. Constantine Drozdovskii is a leader in the Russian community, working to continue and support both Russian and Australian culture. Brian and Margaret Besgrove have put in countless hours and made an enormous contribution to RSL Queensland's National Servicemens Sub Branch and have supported the Nashos community. Jenny Purnell from Sing Australia volunteers for that association as well with the Cannon Hill 60 and Better Association, bringing joy to the people she sings to and visits in nursing homes. Aileen Patterson has worked tirelessly for the past 15 years preparing food and events for her Cannon Hill 60 and Better Association community. Shirley Neander always makes people feel welcome and has been a member of both the Cannon Hill 60 and Better Association and the Cannon Hill School of Arts Association for more than a decade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leanne Cameron from Cannon Hill Community Kindergarten, who taught my children, is a dedicated educator who has gone well beyond her paid role to support early learning for local kids for decades. Carolyn Robinson, the founder of Beyond DV, Time Out Workshops, Hope 4 Life and Bright Start, has been a burst of light and hope for families escaping violence. Jak McPhail is a crossing supervisor at Greenslopes State School, knows every student by name, and volunteers extensively throughout the school community, implementing Containers for Change and encouraging families to recycle. Alison and Robert Coombs have supported local classical music radio station 4MBS for more than 15 years. Noela Billington has volunteered at 4MBS as a classical music announcer, programmer and trainer for 20 years. Wendy Tyson has been on the board of 4MBS and has overseen the accounts and administration for more than a quarter of a century.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barbara Clarke is a guide for people with disabilities wanting to get involved in walking or running through the Achilles Brisbane group, and, as president of the group, she has led by example, overcoming her own challenges. Mark Delbridge has been essential to saving the much-loved Coorparoo Bowls Club, which came perilously close to closing—Mark has volunteered at least thirty hours a week, doing everything from tending the bar to negotiating contracts. Nera Komaric, a refugee from the former Yugoslavia, founded World Wellness Group in my electorate and has dedicated her life to making sure culturally and linguistically diverse communities can have access to essential services. Michael Spragg and Jessica Gregg from Carina Juniors Rugby League Football Club have both worked tirelessly raising funds, organising events and running the club. Jill Lane has been with the Belmont Ladies Bowls Club for almost 20 years and is now its honorary treasurer—despite being a volunteer, she's done everything from modernising their accounts system to preparing their financial reports, handling their cash flow and implementing the Single Touch Payroll system, which I'm sure some small businesses can tell you is not easy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to especially mention 92-year-old Mary Lehn, who's only just stopped running the Carina Senior Citizens Club catering department—a role she had for 15 years. She was running the catering; she did everything from buying the food, organising the people to do the serving, even doing the washing up in that catering role. She also visits residents in the Salvin Park aged-care facility and has helped with hospitality at her local church. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an absolutely wonderful crop of recipients for this year's Griffith Australia Day Awards. I want to thank this year's committee for advising me: Jo Culshaw, Pat Atkinson and my friend Craig Bowen OAM. I look forward to thanking all of the recipients at the ceremony that we'll be having later in the year to congratulate them all on their service to the community and their Griffith Australia Day awards.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Earlier today, I had the pleasure to reflect on the opening of the Australian Space Agency last Wednesday in Adelaide. I want to take the opportunity in the adjournment debate to add to those comments and talk about the precinct more broadly, which the Australian government is investing in as part of our city deal with the South Australian government and the Adelaide city council, known as Lot Fourteen on North Terrace. This is the former site of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Given the new hospital was built and opened in 2017, we were left with a situation where we had an old building on a site, a precinct, nestled within the Adelaide Park Lands and it was not really apparent what we could do with it. Almost two years ago the South Australian state government came up with the concept of turning it into a new innovation precinct, known as Lot Fourteen. Lot Fourteen is the name that was given to that parcel of land by Colonel Light, a very famous Englishman that designed Adelaide city in the 1830s. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from being the home of the Australian Space Agency, Lot Fourteen has a number of other really exciting new engine rooms for growth in our economy and for future jobs. Last Monday, I was able to join many esteemed dignitaries from the Adelaide University, Lockheed Martin and the state government—I was representing the federal government—at the opening of the Australian Institute for Machine Learning. This is a collaboration between Adelaide University and Lockheed Martin, the major defence prime, also with support from government. There are some fascinating projects they're undertaking on behalf of governments as part of the funding commitment being made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One project that I thought was really interesting and exciting is that they're bringing in live feed footage from all of the major intersections in the Adelaide CBD to monitor the flow of traffic. Of course, through the principle of machine learning, through developing algorithms and through the process of those algorithms talking to each other and teaching each other, effectively, we'll hopefully have an outcome where the traffic-light sequencing through the CBD can be run not just on the old-school '90 seconds here, 60 seconds there' but through an optimisation of the perfect amount of time that we need one light to be green, then the next one to go green to support traffic flow through the CBD of Adelaide. Like any CBD, it's the most significant area from a traffic congestion point of view. That's machine learning; that's happening on site at Lot Fourteen. We've got the five heritage buildings there that have been slowly refurbished, one after the other. There's one to go, the Bice Building. The McEwan Building is where the Space Agency was opened by the Prime Minister last Wednesday. We've got the allied health building, where Stone &amp; Chalk are now managing I think 200 workstations for co-collaboration and startup concepts. They're all looked after and curated by Stone &amp;Chalk. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The precinct has so many more exciting things to come. We'll have a new culinary school, relocating the Regency Park facility. It's a great facility, but it is towards 40 years old now, and the future is people being in the CBD, learning in the CBD, and then doing their on-the-job training in hospitality, particularly restaurant and catering, in nearby businesses. That's very exciting. Of course, we've got the Aboriginal art and cultures gallery, which is a major part of the city deal funding that the Commonwealth is contributing, to have an iconic cultural institution added to North Terrace in Adelaide. We intend for that to be the largest collection in the world of Aboriginal art, artefacts and various representations of Indigenous cultures. That's really exciting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a great opportunity. We didn't know what we were going to do with that precinct. Old hospitals tend to be demolished, and this was an opportunity to be a bit creative about what we would do with the heritage buildings in particular, while still creating room in the precinct for new build. Instead of what Labor wanted to do, which was effectively turn it into some kind of housing development, we've turned it into a great asset not only for future jobs and our economy but for everyone in the city of Adelaide and the state of South Australia. I'm very excited about what's in store for that precinct, and I look forward to keeping the House up to date, into the future, as more great milestones come online as we roll out this great collaboration between state, local and federal government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week, the ASIO director-general, Mike Burgess, delivered a pointed warning to Australians about the threats that we face. In particular, he acknowledged the increasing threat that far-Right extremism poses to our nation. In my first months in this place—and before I was elected—I spoke out on several occasions about the threat that far-Right extremism poses and the dangers that some of our nation's leaders have caused in stoking it. We have not yet seen the prevalent right-wing terror attacks that have swept through Europe and the United States, but we must be vigilant and we must stand tall against all forms of prejudice. It is alarming that this threat is on the rise 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are almost at the one-year anniversary of the horrific Christchurch attack which occurred just across the Tasman in which a right-wing terrorist murdered 51 people and injured 49 when he opened fire on a mosque and an Islamic centre during afternoon prayers. That attack has inspired others—on a supermarket in El Paso, synagogues in California and Halle, and shisha bars last week in Hanau. But the Christchurch terrorist, Brenton Tarrant, was from Australia, and his manifesto, which was entitled 'The Great Replacement', made clear that he'd been radicalised by the ideas and tropes of figures of the far Right. He deeply admired a man called Blair Cottrell, a convicted felon known for advocating that Hitler photos be hung in Australian classrooms. Cottrell also helped organise a far-Right rally on St Kilda Beach, in the heart of my electorate—the rally that saw the attendance of disgraced former senator Fraser Anning. The rally, where swastikas and Nazi salutes were commonplace, was advertised as being to discuss the so-called crisis of African gang crime in Melbourne. That was not a campaign confected by the alt-Right in dark corners on the internet. That was a campaign written and authorised by the Victorian Liberal Party which became a cornerstone of their election campaign in 2018 to unseat the Andrews Labor government. Backing them were members of this House, including members of the government—including the Minister for Home Affairs, who made the preposterous claim that Melburnians were too afraid to go out at night because of rampaging African gangs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our words and our actions as members of parliament matter. The leadership we show or fail to show matters. The far Right is an extremist ideology that breeds, and feeds off, hatred of Jews, Muslims and others of all sorts of racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. It is an often interconnected community that, as Director-General Burgess pointed out, meets in person and connects in dark corners of the web. I mentioned 'The Great Replacement', the title of Tarrant's manifesto, because this is a direct reference to the far-Right conspiracy theory that globalist elites have a sinister plot to breed out whiteness from Europe, America and Australia, and to flood them with immigrants to make Western civilisation collapse. This 'replacement' theory was even given credence by the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, at an event Tony Abbott attended. What was his response to Orban's comments? He said Orban had 'the political courage to defy political correctness'. The standards we as leaders set in this place and outside it matter. We need to be vigilant against the rise of racism and extremism in our nation and around the world, and we need to call it out for what it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also acknowledge that there have been some strong words from the Treasurer this week, who I know understands this problem as well as anyone. While the Minister for Home Affairs has often tried to downplay the threat of the far Right, the Treasurer has stood tall, and he is to be commended for that. We need to call it out for what it is, we need to heed the lessons and the warnings issued by the director-general this week, and we need to realise that education is one of the most powerful tools we have in the fight against hate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to commend Victoria's Premier, Daniel Andrews, and Deputy Premier, James Merlino, who announced yesterday that Victoria will make Holocaust education a compulsory part of state school curriculum. All young Australians should grow up with an appreciation of the greatest horrors that racism and anti-Semitism have caused. We must remain united, we must remain vigilant and we must call out the far Right whenever we see it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282983" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise today to speak about a topic that's very close to my heart, and that is e-safety, particularly for our young kids and for families right across Australia. It's on the back of Safer Internet Day 2020, which happened earlier this month. It was an important opportunity for families to take the time to talk to their kids and to talk amongst themselves about how they can make sure their entire family is safe when it comes to accessing the internet, particularly around our children and young Australians, like the young Australians who come here while we're sitting to watch us in parliament, like the kids who are currently behind me—hi, kids!—to make sure that they are safe when it comes to using digital devices. That's because it's something that is just ubiquitous in our society now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must admit that, just before I walked in here to make this speech, I was on a voice call with my little 2½-year-old. From time to time he certainly takes the phone or mobile connected device in order to access a movie or cartoons or something like that, but as parents we need to be ever vigilant, because we know that the size of the problem is significant. According to research from the eSafety Commissioner, Australian children are regularly exposed to harmful online experiences, with 28 per cent of parents aware their child has had a negative experience online. Twenty-eight per cent of parents are aware that their child has had a negative experience—that's over one in every four—but that's not to mention those negative experiences that children have that parents simply aren't aware of. This is my nightmare in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you talk to the eSafety Commissioner, you will hear some horrifying stories. You will hear stories from her of footage that she and her team have watched and identified and had taken off the internet where a young person is being taken advantage of on an internet enabled device while they can literally hear the parents talking in the next room over. It used to be that parents had a lot of things to worry about with regard to their kids, but they knew that when they were home they were safe because they were with mum and dad. Now a child can be taken advantage of on a mobile enabled device in the next room over while their parents, while doing their best, are completely oblivious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what can we do to help give parents the tools in order to keep their kids safe? Well, the government has established the world's first eSafety Commissioner. She's been particularly focused on the safety of kids up until now, but, with the new online safety act that's currently out for consultation, that role is looking to expand to all adults across Australia. She and her office have achieved significant things already. They've reached over 452,000 through education campaigns, they've investigated over 42,000 cases of illegal online content and they've addressed over 1,300 complaints about serious cyberbullying against children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The message to parents is: you do not have to accept cyberbullying and inappropriate online communication between other people and your children as the cost of the internet and having a mobile enabled household—you just don't have to accept it. The eSafety Commissioner, when they're made aware of online bullying and made aware of specific cases, such as revenge porn or inappropriate photos—whatever it may be—they can issue a notice to the service providers to have that material removed. They have a very good success rate in achieving that within 24 to 48 hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've just released a new online safety booklet for under-fives so that parents can start having this conversation with their children nice and early. It revolves around some important principles for kids, and that is to be safe, to be kind online, to ask for help and to make good choices yourself. There is an abundance of resources on the eSafety Commissioner's website, where parents can expand on those themes for their kids to make sure that their children understand the importance of doing those things online—particularly making good choices and avoiding people who they feel uncomfortable with. There are also important resources for parents in this booklet about how you can help your child by exploring the internet together; sitting down with them; being part of that process as they start to understand what it is to live in an internet enabled world; supervising them always; making sure that you're there, even if they're just watching a cartoon or something like that; and always watching your kids to help keep them safe.</span>

                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  It is good to see a fellow regional MP in the chair!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am no fan of Julian Assange. My position on Assange and the charge that he faces has been, like most others in this House, that he deserves the same protections that any Australian deserves—no more and no less. But it has become increasingly clear that Assange has not been treated like any other Australian in trouble overseas. He is a man who has been targeted with extraordinary ruthlessness and single-mindedness by the United States military, intelligence and political apparatus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speech delivered to the House yesterday by my colleague the member for Bruce brought the manifest injustice facing Assange into stark relief, and I urge all in this place to read it. In a nutshell, Assange ran WikiLeaks, a website that, as its name suggests, revelled in publishing secret material. This included classified documents detailing activities by the United States military. WikiLeaks' publishing of this material was highly embarrassing to the US military and intelligence services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that WikiLeaks is not run from the US, that Assange was not and is not a US citizen, and that he did not and does not live there. Unsurprisingly, the US authorities brought legal proceedings against him, including extradition. Of course to be extradited, normally you have to commit a crime in the place that is seeking the extradition. That didn't happen in this case. But if the United States succeeds in having Assange extradited from the UK it will set a new and frightening precedent. It will mean that an Australian journalist, perhaps writing for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>, or a commentator for Nine or the ABC, who says things that US lawmakers consider unlawful under US law, could find themselves the subject of a warrant from the US seeking their extradition to the US to face charges. And if the US can successfully seek to extradite foreigners for breaking their laws, what is to stop other countries with whom we have extradition treaties from doing the same?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As much as this is an issue of individual injustice against Assange, it is an issue of our national sovereignty. An Australian citizen deserves the full protection of their government. Any supposed faith in the United States commitment to due process is misplaced. There is ample evidence, as the member for Bruce outlined, of US activities that run counter to due process. The pursuit of Julian Assange has been political, not judicial, and if he is extradited his future will be in the hands of the Trump administration, not an independent and impartial judiciary. If he is extradited, he faces dying in prison for publishing secrets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am no fan of Julian Assange, but, as the member for Bruce said, it doesn't matter if you agree with him, it doesn't matter if you like him and it doesn't matter if you dislike him. He's an Australian, with the same rights as you or me, and he is entitled to the protection of his government.</span>

Instead of selling their massively overpriced mugs, the Liberals were revealed to have taken the Australian people for mugs. Suddenly their months of arrogant boasts about having returned the budget to surplus, even while it was still in deficit, were shown to be a self-serving campaign of garbage. They're a bit like the dodgy builder who tells you: 'The job's all finished. How great am I? Now pay me.' And then you discover that the job isn't finished at all, and the builder says: 'Well, when I said it was finished, what I meant was that I thought I was going to finish it, but it turned out to be harder than I thought. And how could I know it would rain? Anyway, look over there!'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For any other government, this would have been considered a catastrophic failure on the core promise that they were elected to deliver on. For the Morrison government, this was just Tuesday's scandal of the day, and it wasn't even the biggest scandal of the week. Yesterday we learned that, contrary to the Prime Minister's claims that he had no involvement in the sports rorts scandal, key people in his office had sent 136 emails to the former minister for sport. People in my electorate of Isaacs can only look on in wonder at a Prime Minister who has nothing to say about falling wages, is doing nothing about falling living standards, seems to welcome climate change as a great opportunity for a scare campaign and thought nothing of sneaking out of the country during the bushfire crisis but still had time to intervene 136 times on how best to rort the sports grants scheme to funnel taxpayers' money into the Liberals' re-election campaign.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in my electorate of Isaacs in the south-east of Melbourne who volunteer and participate at sporting clubs in places like Mordialloc, Dandenong and Parkdale never had a chance to get a grant under the Liberal Party's corrupt scheme. Why? Because my seat was not a target seat. My electorate office staff are now fielding upwards of 80 to 100 calls each week from people across my electorate and from around the country absolutely sickened by the corrupt behaviour of the Morrison government, failed leadership and deceitful abuse of taxpayers' money through this scandalous sports rorts scheme, a rorting scheme that was entirely conceived and executed for the Prime Minister's own political gain. One community organisation in my electorate, like many others around the country, was knocked back under Mr Morrison's scandalous sports rorts pyramid scheme. No reason was given. All it received was a sanitised and generic rejection letter. This government is a disgrace.</span>
