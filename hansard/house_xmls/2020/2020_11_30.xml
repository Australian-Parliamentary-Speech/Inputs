I commence by thanking the Manager of Opposition Business for his agreement and assistance. This is a small modification, essentially, to allow the Prime Minister to attend and answer questions in question time today remotely, noting that the original draft of this agreement included that remote contributions were to occur at either electorate offices or Commonwealth parliamentary offices, of which The Lodge is neither. This amended arrangement will include The Lodge in that list.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We are applicants of Australian skilled visas (189/190/489/491,...), waiting for more than 8 months , the official disclosed duration. Generally, preparing documents for a skilled visa takes more than one year, followed by a long post-lodge waiting. In 2020, applicants are more stressful than ever, because the grants take longer time to hit the ground. Some applicants have experienced more than one year or even two. Due to the pandemic, the torment still last. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We respect the holistic configuration and strategy of the border control and the critical sector classification, as fully border opening definitely undermines the anti-covid triumph. And we also value our agreement BEFORE the pandemic happened. In some cases the primary applicant is onshore and secondary applicants are offshore, forcing them to live continents apart due to the delay in the visa process. What's worse, most will face the expiration of some documents, such as PCC, health check, language certificate. Redoing PCC, health check, and language certification is meaningless in most cases. It is completely avoidable if the regular processing restarts.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To set a clear mandate to shift away from fossil fuels, severely restrict the further destruction of natural areas and protect and rehabilitate damaged land for increased biodiversity, the Leaders' Pledge for Nature is an ambitious but achievable goal to set Australia on a path to environmental sustainability. The details of the pledge are clearly defined and signify the willingness of Australia to recognize that even a country as sparsely populated as ours needs to be conscious and dedicated to reducing its outsized impact on our planet. Upholding the diversity and sustainability of our boundless plains, waterways and atmosphere will drive a fundamental mindset shift in the way we provide clean air, food, water and power to Australians, whilst unlocking the exciting future potentials of low-impact development, tourism, prosperity, manufacturing and farming.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Politicians and political parties can mislead and deceive without consequence. Misleading parliament laws exist, applied only when parliamentarians knowingly present false information to Parliament. Convention previously resulted in resignation of Ministers when this occurred; this convention is no longer followed. Outside of Parliament, no rules exist. Voting occurs every 3 or 4 years, during this time, there are no consequences for dishonest behaviour. The vote is often between small options of dishonest candidates. This has resulted in lowering quality of elected candidates. New options are required to challenge deceptive behaviour within the courts. This would allow for evidence to be presented and assessed, outside of the brief slogans of the new cycle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to create misleading and deceptive conduct laws, applying to politicians, their staffers and political parties. The laws should be formed to allow citizens to directly sue individuals or parties to seek damages where damage can be shown from any deceptive public conduct from these individuals or organisations. This will not eradicate dishonest behaviour but will provide a method for citizens to challenge dishonesty within the public debate within the courts. The laws should include the ability to sue politicians, their staffers and their political parties for not correcting the record when they notice dishonest conduct within their ranks. This will provide a greater incentive for individuals to publicly dispute dishonest behaviour within their own party to avoid potential lawsuits from citizens. This creates competitive self-interest among those seeking to deceive the public.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The first few years of a child's life presents the greatest opportunity to develop positive social skills and resilience. The long term social and economic benefits of early childhood learning have been proven to lead to less long term reliance on welfare and a lower crime rate. Participants in high-quality early childhood education show lower rates of incarceration (46% reduction), lower rates of arrest for violent crimes (33% reduction), and less likely to have received government assistance (26% reduction).</span>

We shouldn't further disadvantage people whose disadvantage drives them to smoke. Charging pack-a-day smokers in excess of $16,000 a year isn't the answer.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Citizens are being denied their right to return to Australia, violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The arrivals cap on people entering Australia is forcing Australians to become stateless or into forced exile. Over 100,000 are stranded overseas. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The suffering for these stranded Australians is inhumane. Flights cancelled with little notice, leaving many homeless, living in airports. Many have young children including newborns. With mental health stretched to extremes, it's only a matter of time before someone self-harms. Australia's governments, while ignoring the plight of Australian Citizens, is making every effort to bring in foreigners such as sportspeople, students and fruit-pickers. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to the cap being implemented, the quarantine system was able to cope with higher arrival numbers. The quarantine breakdown in Victoria was due to state based issues. Other states did not have outbreaks at that time.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Many methods including home quarantine, have been used effectively by other countries to keep the local population safe while allowing citizens to return. In addition, the way cap numbers are calculated is absurd, for example, a baby not requiring a 'seat' is still counted into the cap. The numbers of rooms used for hotel quarantine is actually much less than the headline numbers. Victoria's airport and hotels are idle.</span>

The area exports fruit around the world, delivers to every state in Australia, yet are expected to operate with substandard internet speeds and almost non-existent mobile reception.

              <span class="HPS-Small">In a study published in Environmental Research Letters, the authors found that the greatest effect one can have on mitigating climate change is by having one fewer child. According to the study from Lund University in Sweden, having one fewer child equates to a reduction of 58 tonnes of carbon dioxide for each year of a parent's life, however Australians' emissions are currently sitting at 16 tonnes per person per annum. According to economist Sir Nicholas Stern, we need to reduce anthropogenic emissions to two tonnes per person annually if we are to avoid a global average temperature rise above 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.</span>

My concern is that we are diminishing our public owned entities and expanding the private ones. I would like to see a royal commission into the privatising of our public assets to make sure that a safe balance of public and private entities exist. It has been shown that some entities work well as private companies and some don't. From recent experience some public hospitals that have been run by private companies have not worked. It also appears that looking after our elderly by the private sector has not been a great success as shown by the number of recent deaths in aged care. Banks appear to work as private companies as do private hospitals and toll road companies. Our precious water also seems to be having trouble in private hands. Assets such as water, I believe should remain public. I am not expert enough to be able to decide which of these entities should be private or public so I am calling on the government to hold a royal commission to establish a correct ratio of public to private that benefits the whole country and all of its people.</span>

The plastics that are currently being used are poisoning the earth and all living beings.

Our land fill is at a ridiculous state and cannot continue to be filled with plastics that do not degrade and break down, these plastics are toxic and leak this toxicity. The use of these plastics needs to stop or we will be at a place of no return, the Ban of these plastics will stop this cycle and then we can clean and clear what we do have in a more productive and environmentally friendly way.

Innocent people are murdered to order so that organs (kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, corneas, skin) can be procured as commodities for sale.

Practitioners numbered over 70 million. A secret extrajudicial unit, the 610 Office, was established by the Chinese government to eradicate Falun Gong. Over the subsequent years, forced live organ harvesting has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry in China. Other victims to these horrors include entire ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs. Organs have been harvested from people while awake without any anaesthetics.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your emails of 9 April 2020 and 17 September 2020 regarding petition number EN1314, which requests that Australia seek to insert Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex as its King and Queen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this petition to my attention and apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The preamble to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act </span>refers to the historical fact of the agreement to federate under the 'Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'. Covering clause 2 of that Act states that references to 'the Queen' extend to 'Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The passing of the British Empire has meant that the Queen is now 'sovereign' of a number of separate and independent nations, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. It is now generally accepted that, as Queen of Australia, the Queen holds an entirely distinct position from that which she holds as Queen of the United Kingdom (or any other country). A former Chief Justice of Australia, the Hon Sir Harry Gibbs, stated that '[t]he allegiance which Australians owe to Her Majesty is owed not as British subjects but as subjects of the Queen of Australia' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Pochi v Macphee </span>(1982) 151 CLR 101 at 109). It is quite clear both that the current Queen of Australia (and of the United Kingdom) is a successor to Queen Victoria and that references in the Australian Constitution to 'the Queen' encompass references to the current Queen. This is reflected in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Style and Titles Act 1973, </span>under which the current Royal Style and Titles in Australia are 'Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth' .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has no proposal to alter the Royal succession to the throne in Australia to install the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as its King and Queen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Succession to the Crown was altered in some respects in Australia (as it also was in the United Kingdom and in other Commonwealth Realms) by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Succession</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">to the Crown Act 2015 </span>(Cth). That Act made three reforms concerning the succession to the Crown consistent with changes enacted in the United Kingdom in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Succession to the Crown Act 2013 </span>(UK). Those reforms are: ,</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">COVID-19</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 15 June 2020 referring to me a petition concerning the risks to the integrity of Australian democracy and accountability regarding the exercise of executive powers and spending of public money during the COVID-19 period. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you can appreciate, the first priority of any government is the security and protection of the Australian people. A pandemic moves at an exponential pace. A loss of days can result in untold loss and suffering. At the time of writing, in excess of 911,000 lives have been lost worldwide. Sadly that includes over 800 Australians. Australia can be proud of its efforts to date. There is a long way to go, but all levels of government have worked tirelessly on protecting our people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The pandemic has required that Australia act with an unwavering focus on protecting our people. Parliament, like the rest of Australian society, is not immune to the dangers posed by COVID-19. The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate are strong custodians for the institution of Parliament. They have worked exceptionally hard to ensure the Parliamentary precincts are COVID safe. The Presiding Officers have ensured the Parliament acted as a role model for other work places whilst ensuring the Parliament's vital work did not suffer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the sittings of the Parliament, prior to the COVID-19 crisis the parliamentary calendar for 2020 had 72 sitting days for the House of Representatives, and 57 sitting days for the Senate plus 19 days for Estimates hearings. The pandemic forced changes to the parliamentary calendar - like it did to just about every public gathering in the world, including our courts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The calendar has been adjusted on a number of occasions - and now has 58 days of sitting of the House, and 46 sitting days for the Senate plus 15 days for Estimates hearings. This was about keeping Australians safe.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By way of comparison, there are now planned to be 58 sitting days (House of Representatives) for 2020, compared to 45 days in 2019 (election year), 65 days in 2018 and 64 days in 2017. This means that the Parliament will sit for a broadly similar number of days as in previous years when Australia was not facing the challenges of a global pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government welcomes scrutiny. In addition to the ordinary mechanisms for the Parliament to hold the Government to account, a number of measures have emerged in response to COVID-19. For example, the Senate has established a Select Committee on the Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee, like other Senate Committees, has the full range of powers to call for documents and witnesses, which will be necessary for its inquiry. The terms of reference for the Committee are broad, as is the Committee's membership. The Chair of the Committee is a Senator from the Opposition, and it includes two Government Senators, two other Senators from the Opposition, one Senator from the Australian Greens and Senator Jacqui Lambie. The Government supported the establishment of this Committee and considers it is appropriate to review the actions and decisions taken by the Government during this pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing these concerns to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Teachers</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 24 August 2020 referring a number of petitions (listing enclosed), received by the Standing Committee on Petitions, regarding the Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (the test).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For all teachers, no matter the year level or subjects they teach, strong personal literacy and numeracy skills form an essential part of the attributes and skills needed to be effective in the classroom. While personal literacy and numeracy skills are only one element of what makes a good teacher, they are critical to fostering the development of strong personal literacy and numeracy in students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement that students undertaking an initial teacher education program have personal literacy and numeracy skills that are in the top 30 per cent of the adult population was introduced by agreement of all education ministers. The test requirement has been implemented through the Accreditation of Initial Teacher Education Programs in Australia: Standards and Procedures (the Standards and Procedures) since 2011, with the test being used since 2016 as the means for demonstrating a student has achieved this standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Standard 3.5, higher education providers have a key role in the process. The Standard states that 'Entrants to initial teacher education will possess levels of personal literacy and numeracy broadly equivalent to the top 30 per cent of the population. Providers who select students who do not meet this requirement must establish satisfactory arrangements to ensure that these students are supported to achieve the required standard before graduation.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the test requirement is related to accreditation of initial teacher education programs and/or registration as a teacher, each state or territory is responsible for imposing the requirement relating to the test in that jurisdiction under the relevant state or territory legislation. This includes specifying how the test interacts with progression through an initial teacher education program and/or subsequent registration as a teacher. As a result, some states and territories have different requirements regarding the test. Students should contact the teacher regulatory body in their state or territory to confirm specific jurisdictional requirements, including requirements to sit the test at a particular point in their program. As it is states and territories who manage accreditation of initial teacher education courses, the Australian Government is not able to grant exemptions to the test requirement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Even in these unprecedented times, maintaining an expectation of high-quality teaching is important. As such, the requirement for initial teacher education students to meet the standard of the test prior to graduation remains in place. The Australian Council for Education Research, which administers the test, has put in place arrangements so that all people who need to sit the test in 2020 can do so. Further information about arrangements for the test is available online at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au/.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Candidates are allowed up to three opportunities to sit the test. In special and/or extenuating circumstances, higher education providers may consider that individual students should be provided additional test attempts up to a maximum of five (including the initial three attempts).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For students who have a disability or health-related need which might interfere with their ability to sit the test, ACER continues to offer reasonable adjustments to provide students with appropriate testing conditions. Further information on the reasonable adjustments application process can be found at teacheredtest.acer.edu.au/register/reasonable-adjustments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist candidates to prepare to sit the test, ACER offers a range of resources on the test website, including:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to suggestions that the test be used as an entry requirement, universities do have the option to use the test as a selection tool; however, to date none have elected to use it in this way. Universities are responsible for the selection of students into initial teacher education and for ensuring their programs adequately prepare all students to meet the test standard. Students are strongly encouraged to seek support and remedial assistance from their higher education provider as appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government actively monitors the delivery of all national programs and commissioned an independent review of the implementation of the test. Decisions regarding the LANTITE review are matters for all education ministers through Education Council and it is anticipated that it will be considered in December.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government remains committed to ensuring high quality graduates enter Australian classrooms. The test is an important component of providing this assurance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 24 August 2020 to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services, the Hon Stuart Robert MP, concerning a petition received on the social security deeming rates. As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibility, your letter has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The deeming rules are used to assess income from financial investments for social security purposes. Financial investments include all bank accounts, managed investments, shares and most superannuation. To calculate the investment income assessed, deeming rates are applied to the total market value of a person's financial investments. The actual returns from the person's investments are not used for income assessment.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$53,000 of a single recipient's total financial investments,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$88,000 of a pensioner couple's total financial investments,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$44,000 of total financial investments for each member of a couple who receives an allowance payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A deeming rate of 2.25 per cent applies to financial investments above these amounts. The thresholds at which the upper deeming rate begins to apply are reviewed in line with the Consumer Price Index in July each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The lower deeming rate is designed to reflect available returns from safe and accessible investments, such as savings accounts. The upper deeming rate is designed to reflect that as a person's assets increase, they often have some higher-return investments that may have limited accessibility or some additional risk.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The two-rate structure of deeming rules means that the upper deeming rate only applies to a portion of a social security recipient's financial investments, rather than all of their financial assets. For example, under the current deeming rates, a single pensioner with $100,000 in financial assets would only need to achieve a rate of return of 1.2 per cent across their investment portfolio to match the deeming rates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current system of deeming was implemented in the 1990s in response to concerns from retirees and advocacy groups. It is designed to be simple, fair and reduce the extent that payments received from Centrelink may vary - an important feature for many income support recipients. By treating all financial investments in the same way, the deeming rules also encourage people to choose investments on their merit, not on how they may affect their rate of payment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020 enclosing Petition EN1581 concerning temporary visa holders seeking exemptions from Australia's travel restrictions. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the Minister for Home Affairs as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, from 1 February 2020, the Australian Government has progressively announced travel restrictions to curb the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Australia. From 20 March 2020, travel restrictions have been in place prohibiting travel into Australia of all foreign nationals, unless they fall within certain exempt categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The travel restrictions have been successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Australia , and were implemented on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have taken decisions to impose health restrictions such as mandatory two weeks quarantine for all international arrivals. Unfortunately, limited hotel rooms have been made available for quarantine purposes by the state governments who administer the quarantine arrangements. The problem has been compounded by arbitrary state border closures where returning state residents are placed in hotel quarantine, taking places that would otherwise have been utilised by citizens returning from overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Decisions to grant exemptions must be balanced against the Government 's intent for imposing the travel restrictions, that is, the potential health risks posed to the Australian community by international travellers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 24 August 2020 to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and Minister for Government Services, the Hon Stuart Robert MP<span style="font-weight:bold;">, </span>concerning the petition on the Age Pension age (EN1584). As the matters raised fall within my portfolio responsibility, your email has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no official retirement age in Australia. Retirement decisions are a matter for each individual. Australians are living longer than before and the Government is committed to ensuring the Age Pension is sustainable and future demand can be met. To receive the Age Pension, a person must also satisfy the residence and means test requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is acting decisively in the national interest to support households and businesses and to address the significant economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. If a person below Age Pension qualification age is unable to work, they may be eligible for an alternative social security payment. The temporary fortnightly Coronavirus Supplement applies to recipients of allowances such as the JobSeeker Payment. It recognises that the depressed job market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult for people who are, or who become, unemployed to find new work in the coming months. It is targeted at those who were most likely to have experienced a reduction in employment income, or who would have trouble in gaining employment because of COVID-19 restrictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Coronavirus Supplement changed from $550 to $250 per fortnight from 25 September 2020 to reflect the gradually improving economic and labour market conditions, and to balance the level of support people are receiving with incentives to get back into the job market. More information is available at </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As steps are taken to re-open the Australian economy, mutual obligation requirements for job seekers have re-commenced in a limited capacity for everywhere except Victoria. Most JobSeeker Payment recipients have mutual obligation requirements, which are designed to ensure that recipients are actively looking for work and are participating in activities that will help them into employment. Depending on their age and how long they have been receiving payment for, recipients aged 55 years and over may choose to satisfy their mutual obligation requirements through approved voluntary work, suitable paid work (including self-employment), or a combination of these activities. More information on mutual obligation requirements for jobseekers can be found at: www.dese.gov.au/news/mutual-obligation-requirements-job-seekers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Act 2018 </span>was passed in March 2018, as part of the modernisation of the social security system. The legislation provided for the cessation of Wife Pension and the creation of JobSeeker Payment on 20 March 2020. As part of the Government's reform of the income support system for people of working age, Wife Pension recipients who were under Age Pension age and did not qualify to receive Carer Allowance were transferred to JobSeeker Payment, which is the main income support payment for working age Australians who have capacity to work now or in the future. These recipients receive a transition rate of payment, maintained at up to the maximum Wife Pension rate as at 19 March 2020. This is higher than the JobSeeker Payment maximum rate and recipients will also retain their Pensioner Concession Card. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is investing record funding in 2020-21 into child care to provide more support to families. This investment will increase over the next few years to more than $10 billion per year.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Child Care Package (the Package), the Government implemented the Child Care Subsidy (CCS). The CCS is designed to target financial support to lower and middle income families, with the percentage of subsidy a family is entitled to being based on combined annual family income. Families earning $69,390 or less are entitled to the maximum CCS rate of 85 per cent of the annual fee charged, or of the relevant hourly rate cap (whichever is lower) . As family income increases the rate of subsidy decreases, reaching zero per cent of $353,680. Families with incomes at or above this threshold have no CCS entitlement. While the CCS may not subsidise the total of Australian families' child care costs, it is designed to assist as many families as possible within the Government's financial limitations. This approach ensures more financial support is targeted to families who need it most to access child care.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The number of hours of subsidised care a family is entitled to per fortnight is determined by a three-step activity test, which ensures Government support for child care is better targeted to those who depend on child care to work, train, study, volunteer or participate in other recognised activities.</span>

                </mc:AlternateContent>The activity test has a low entry requirement to assist parents returning to work in a graduated manner or undertaking other activities. Parents only need to undertake a minimum of eight hours of recognised activity per fortnight to access 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight. There are also exemptions to the activity test for parents who legitimately cannot meet the activity requirements.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Package includes a number of mechanisms to help reduce costs for parents. For example, an hourly rate cap, which is the maximum hourly rate the Government will subsidise for each service type, effectively sets a reference point from which parents can expect prices should not dramatically exceed, and from which they can hold providers accountable. The Government has also opened up flexibility for child care providers to operate in a way that works best for their families.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit most from quality early childhood education and care. Therefore, the Government provides additional support for families in particular circumstances . For example, under the Child Care Safety Net, families earning $69,390 or less who do not meet the activity test are entitled to 24 hours of subsidised early childhood education and care per fortnight. That is equivalent to two six hour sessions per week, subsidised at the highest 85 per cent rate. Further, the Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) acts as a top up payment to the CCS which provides targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care. ACCS fully subsidises child care in some cases where families require additional support. For instance, families transitioning to work or dealing with job loss or when they need practical help with the cost of child care to support their child's wellbeing. More information can be found at www.education.gov.au/additional-child-care-subsidy-0.</span>

The Government's Early Childhood Education and Care Relief Package (Relief Package) was a temporary measure designed to ensure the viability of the sector whilst providing free child care to Australian families from April to mid July 2020. The Relief Package helped many families continue to participation in the workforce.</span>

A survey of all approved child care services conducted in May 2020 showed that most services reported that the Relief Package, together with the JobKeeper Payment helped them to: stay open (90 per cent of services), remain financially viable (82 per cent), retain staff (91 per cent), provide child care to the children of essential workers and vulnerable children (91 per cent) and keep children enrolled (82 per cent).</span>

Families who have had their hours of activity reduced as a result of COVID-19 will be able to access up to 100 hours per fortnight of care to 4 April 2021. Beyond Victoria, demand for child care is now above pre COVID-19 levels.</span>

                </mc:AlternateContent>Dear Mr O'Dowd </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 24 August 2020, referring Petition EN1597 about an inquiry into the protections available to casual employees under the unfair dismissal provisions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>(the Act) to me as Minister for Industrial Relations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Casual work is intended to provide a degree of flexibility for both employers and employees. Recognising that casual workers do not receive the same entitlements as part time and full time employees, most modern awards provide a casual loading of 25 per cent on top of the base rate of pay for full-time and part-time employees. Casual work is a genuine and fulfilling arrangement for many people, such as those balancing work with studying or family responsibilities. This has been the case for many decades, under many governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The unfair dismissal provisions of the Act provide important protections for employees and aim to ensure that a 'fair go all around' is given to the rights of employees and employers. The Act does provide some unfair dismissal protections for casual employees. These require that they were employed on a regular and systematic basis, and had a reasonable expectation of ongoing employment on that basis. These requirements are intended to strike an appropriate balance between the rights of employers and employees and arose from the introduction of the Act by the Labor Government in 2009.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Moreover, an employee's casual status does not exempt them from protection from termination for a discriminatory reason. The general protections provisions prohibit adverse action, such as dismissal and loss of shifts, by an employer against its employees for discriminatory reasons, including disability, sex, age, family or carer's responsibilities, and pregnancy. It is also unlawful to take adverse action against an employee because of the employee's workplace rights. In contrast to unfair dismissal, there is no cap on compensation in the general protections jurisdiction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither the Attorney-General nor the Attorney-General's Department provides legal advice to the public. However I note that, without commenting on whether the common law recognises a general principle of equality, the Commonwealth Parliament can always override the common law where the Commonwealth has legislative power and where it clearly expresses an intention to do so in legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises the consistency of the Act's unfair dismissal provisions with the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights </span>(ICCPR). Australia complies with all of its obligations under international law, including under the ICCPR. Consistent with the ICCPR, Australia ensures that persons are not barred from bringing a suit against other persons by reason of their race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Employment standards formulated by the United Nations specialised agency the International Labour Organization (ILO) are also relevant to the issues raised in this petition. In particular, Australia has ratified the International Labour Organization's (ILO) <span style="font-style:italic;">Termination of Employment Convention 1982 (No. 158), </span>which enables workers engaged on a casual basis for a short period to be exempt from unfair dismissal laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers the existing arrangements under the Act to provide appropriate protections for the rights of casual employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing this petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Facial Recognition Technology</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020 enclosing Petition EN1600 concerning the use of facial recognition technology in Australia. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to keeping Australians and their personal information safe. The Government's investment in, and use of, facial recognition technology is essential to Australia's security and economic interests. It is vital to the management of Australia's border to help to protect people from identity crime, and is becoming increasingly important for improving Government service delivery, including to victims of natural disasters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Being able to reliably establish identity is an important element of the Government's commitment to strengthening the identity security of Australians, through the National Identity Security Strategy. The Department of Home Affairs is leading implementation of new biometric face matching services in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Identity Matching Services, agreed by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments in October 2017.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also introduced primary legislation to improve privacy protections and transparency measures as they relate to the sharing of personal information through the services, to ensure the rights of all Australians are protected. The Identity-matching Services Bill 2019 (the Bill) is currently before the Parliament, and will give effect to the Commonwealth's commitments under the Intergovernmental Agreement. The legislation was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The Government is carefully considering the Committee's report on the Bill to strengthen privacy safeguards over the operation of these services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Identity crime continues to be one of the most common and costly crimes in Australia. According to the latest statistics compiled by the Australian Institute of Criminology, identity crime costs over AUD2 billion per year, impacts one in 10 Australians each year, and affects one in four Australians over their lifetime. The face matching services established by the Intergovernmental Agreement will reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud in the community, and improve the delivery of key government services, including disaster relief and income support, while maintaining the integrity of these programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Privacy and ethics are at the forefront of the Government's use of facial recognition. The Government is committed to demonstrating a high standard of privacy governance, and are steadfast in the ethical use of biometric technology, in accordance with all applicable laws, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988. </span>The Government is equally committed to ensuring that the facial recognition technology being used is as accurate as possible. The Government continues to work with national and international biometric testing bodies to improve the accuracy of its biometric systems. According to recent independent testing, the facial recognition technology used by Commonwealth Government agencies, including the Department, is among the most accurate in the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands the concerns raised around facial recognition technology, and the prospect of real-time monitoring of people in public places (sometimes referred to as 'mass surveillance'). Put simply, the technology deployed through the face matching services cannot be used in this way. The system is deliberately designed not to accept live video feeds, such as CCTV.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, only a specified list of law enforcement, anti-corruption and security agencies may use the Government's services to identify people. It is therefore not possible for private sector organisations, such as operators of stadiums, or local government authorities to use the face matching services provided by the Department to scan a crowd to identify people. As a further safeguard , the Intergovernmental Agreement stresses that the services are not to be used as the sole basis for ascertaining a person's identity for evidentiary purposes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </mc:AlternateContent>Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 August 2020 regarding Petition No EN1605, presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions, raising concerns about parenting arrangements after family relationship breakdown and the collection of child support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has established a Joint Select Committee to inquire into the family law system. For those going through the family law system, it is important that the systems they have to go through work as best as they can. Family breakdown is a risk factor for suicide, it is a time when family violence can escalate and it warrants this level of attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The terms of reference for the inquiry are broad and allow for the examination of a range of matters that have a real and practical impact on Australian families. The inquiry allows for an examination of the complicated interaction of the family law system with the child support system. The inquiry also provides for a careful examination of the financial costs to families involved in family law proceedings, and options to ensure that costs, including legal fees, are proportionate to the issues in dispute. The inquiry will further look at the impacts of family law proceedings on the health, safety and wellbeing of children and families involved in those proceedings.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 October 2020, the Committee released an interim report covering a broad range of topics, including issues of relevance to the petition, such as, the interaction between Australia's Child Support Scheme and the family law system; enforcement of parenting orders; and arbitration, mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The Committee is scheduled to deliver its final report by the last sitting day in February 2021. The interim report, the Committee's terms of reference and further information about the inquiry are available from the Committee's website at:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975 </span>does not make specific provision for relocation of children or parents following separation. As with other parenting arrangements, where relocation is in issue, the parties are encouraged to agree on the best outcome for their children. Where a relocation matter progresses to a family law court, the court will examine a range of considerations in deciding which parenting orders are proper. In deciding these matters, the court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Family Law Act, parents retain parental responsibility for children under the age of 18 after separation, subject to court orders. If a parent decides to unilaterally relocate a child, a family court may make orders requiring that the child be returned. In considering orders to that effect, the court will consider what is in the best interests of the child. In the event that a parent unilaterally relocates a child domestically and the court makes orders for the return of the child, either on an interim or final basis, and the parent refuses to return the child, the court may make recovery orders, seeking the assistance of the Australian Federal Police to return the child.</span>

The provisions cover removing and retaining a child overseas in breach of a court order or where parenting proceedings are pending before a court, subject to certain exceptions. The offences are punishable by a penalty of up to three years' imprisonment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Law Act requires separated couples needing to resolve parenting arrangements to make a genuine effort at family dispute resolution before attending court, unless one of the exceptions applies, such as family violence, child abuse or urgency.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted above, the Family Law Act requires separated couples needing to resolve parenting arrangements to make a genuine effort at family dispute resolution before attending court, unless an exception applies, such as family violence, child abuse or urgency. Specifically, where the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been or would be a risk of abuse of the child if there were to be a delay in applying for a court order, or this would place a party at risk of family violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These exceptions ensure that separating couples are not required to attend family dispute resolution in circumstances that would be unsafe or inappropriate. They also protect those at immediate risk of violence or abuse from delays in attending court.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Law Act provides a legal framework for resolving arrangements for children and property following a relationship breakdown. The 'best interests of the child' is the paramount consideration when resolving parenting matters. This includes the need to protect children from harm and, in the absence of factors such as violence or abuse, for children to enjoy a meaningful relationship with each of their parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In cases of high conflict or where there is a perceived or actual risk to a child if they were to spend unsupervised time with a parent, the family courts may order supervised contact visits. The court must be satisfied that those orders are in the child's best interests. In some cases a court may order supervised visits where a child is being introduced or reintroduced to a parent or family member with whom they have spent little or no time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government funds Children's Contact Services to help parents comply with such orders and for children from separated families to establish or maintain a relationship with the parent with whom they do not live.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family law cases are often complex and, in each individual case, the facts need to be considered by the court and a decision made on those facts.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 24 August 2020 referring a copy of petition number EN1613. The petition requests that every teacher be trained to support students with mental health issues . I present the below response for consideration by the Standing Committee on Petitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the importance of educators being able to support the mental health and wellbeing of students, including providing support to students who have experienced trauma.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (the Teacher Standards) provide a nationally agreed quality assurance mechanism against which teachers can be assessed to ensure they have the competencies required to be effective educators.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Teacher Standards are a public statement of what constitutes quality teaching and define what teachers should know and be able to do at different stages across their careers (Graduate, Proficient, Highly Accomplished and Lead). The Teacher Standards comprise three domains: Professional Knowledge, Professional Practice and Professional Engagement, each with a number of standards that articulate the knowledge, skills and attributes required across the four career stages. Standard 4 - Create and maintain supportive and safe learning environments includes strategies to support students' wellbeing and safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Teacher Standards also underpin national approaches to the accreditation of initial teacher education programs, the registration of teachers and the formal certification of Highly Accomplished and Lead Teachers. All states and territories have linked the Teacher Standards to registration requirements, and some make reference to the Teacher Standards in professional learning requirements for teachers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that the states, territories and the non-government schooling sector have day-to-day responsibility for the management of Australian schools and employment of teachers. Responsibility for setting priorities for teacher professional learning sits with state and territory teacher regulatory authorities, government and non-government education departments, schools and their teaching staff .</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr O'Dowd</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 19 October 2020 enclosing a petition, PET EN1665 regarding the Job-ready Graduates package (the package) of reforms to higher education.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 19 October 2020, the Parliament passed the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. Commencing next year:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">There will be more university places for Australian students, growing to 100,000 additional places in 10 years_</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Regional students and regional universities will benefit from additional support worth more than $400 million, including access to a $5,000 Tertiary Access Payment to help with relocation costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Students will pay less to study in areas of expected future job demand, with discounted fees for teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English, languages, agriculture, maths, science, health, architecture, environmental science, information technology and engineering.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">A $900 million National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund will support universities to work with local industry to produce job-ready graduates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian Government funding to the university sector is at a record high. This package will not reduce the level of funding the Government provides to universities. In fact, it provides more funding and certainty for universities. University funding will grow by $2 billion to 2024 and locks in indexation at pre-COVID rates for the next three years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To be able to support Australians through the COVID-19 pandemic, the higher education system must adapt. Demand for higher education increases during economic slowdowns and students seek job relevant skills to help them enter and re-enter the workforce. The package supports increased demand from school leavers and provides more options for upskilling and reskilling workers who have lost employment due to COVID -19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It also seeks to bridge the gap in attainment rates between regional and remote students, and metropolitan students; drive productivity for the regions; and bolster the research capacity of regional universities. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from regional areas upon admission to their university of choice will have funding of a Commonwealth supported place. These reforms respond to the National Regional, Rural and Remote Tertiary Education Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On top of the additional funding provided as part of these important reforms, the 2020-21 Budget provides over $1.2 billion to support the university research sector to ensure the ongoing capability and excellence of Australian research. This includes an additional $1 billion in 2021 to alleviate the immediate financial pressures on universities caused by the reduction of international students who are unable to enter Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Budget also provides $550 million for 12,000 extra university places and 50,000 short course places for Australians to upskill or reskill.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information about the Job-ready Graduates package or 2020-21 Budget measures can be found on the Department of Education, Skills and Employment's website at www.dese.gov.au/job-ready.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Abdominoplasty Surgery</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 7 October 2020 concerning petition EN1751, requesting the reinstatement of Medicare benefits for abdominoplasty for post-partum women.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I sympathise with those who have been diagnosed with rectus diastasis following pregnancy. The decision not to provide Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) rebates for abdominoplasty for correction of diastasis recti in post-partum women is based on the recommendation of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) after it considered the lack of evidence concerning the procedure in April 2015 and again in November 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MSAC appraises new medical services and provides advice to me on whether they should be publicly funded based on an assessment of its comparative safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, using the best available evidence. In 2015 and 2019 the MSAC found that although abdominoplasty had benefits for weight loss patients, there was insufficient evidence to justify Medicare funding of abdominoplasty for diastasis recti in post-partum women. Further information on the considerations of MSAC can be found at: www.msac. gov.au using the search term 'abdominoplasty'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) has notified my Department that they intend to submit a new application to MSAC requesting public funding for abdominoplasty for post-partum women suffering severe diastasis recti. Patients may wish to contact ASPS via email at: info@plasticsurgey.org.au to determine when they intend to submit the application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Those diagnosed with diastasis recti following pregnancy may be interested to know that they can choose to be treated free-of-charge in the public hospital system. As public hospitals are the responsibility of state and territory governments patients may wish to contact their relevant state or territory health department to determine what support and services may be available to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Mobile Coverage</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your email of 1 September 2020 regarding Petition PN0476, which relates to residents' concerns from residents of Repton, NSW about the level of mobile phone reception in their area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department has reviewed the coverage maps published by Optus, Telstra and TPG Telecom, and these confirm that 3G and 4G mobile reception is variable in some locations in the Repton area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of factors that can interfere with mobile reception at any given time or place, including in the Repton area. These factors include distance from mobile base stations, terrain, buildings (including their internal structure) and other physical obstacles such as trees interrupting the line-of-sight from the nearest mobile base station.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of products are available to improve mobile reception, including external antennae and authorised signal boosters and repeaters. Wi-Fi calling is also available on the mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device, allowing some customers to call and text over a Wi-Fi connection. This can be particularly helpful in areas that have poor indoor coverage. I encourage the residents of Repton to contact their mobile service provider to identify ways to improve their mobile reception and to obtain further advice regarding Wi-Fi calling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through its $380 million Mobile Black Spot Program, the Government is supporting investment in mobile infrastructure where the commercial incentives are otherwise insufficient for the carriers. The Government's commitment has to date generated a total investment of more than $836 million in more than 1,200 mobile base stations across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government intends that the next step in the Program will be to conduct a Round 5A, which will open for applications shortly. Funding has also been allocated for Round 6, which will commence after the competitive assessment process for Round 5A is complete.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My Department maintains a central register of locations that have been the subject of a complaint concerning poor or non-existent mobile coverage, and this register will be made available to all applicants when they are applying for funding under future rounds of the Program. Repton has been added to this register following receipt of the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately, it is a commercial decision for the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) as to whether to invest in further mobile infrastructure in the Repton area and whether to apply for funding under the Program. Community members may therefore wish to contact their local council and the MNOs to make their coverage issues known. Past experience has shown that when local communities and councils engage with the MNOs, it increases the likelihood that an application for Mobile Black Spot funding for a specific location will be submitted. I enclose the MNOs' contact details for reference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note the petitioners' concerns regarding landline outages during emergencies. The Government takes issues related to emergency communications very seriously, and has announced a $37.1 million package to prevent, mitigate and manage telecommunications emergency outages. This package includes four elements:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$18 million for mobile network hardening, including increased power backup</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$10 million for temporary telco infrastructure deployments</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$7 million for better telecommunications for rural and country fire service depots and evacuation centres</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$2.1 million to improve Government information to communities about access to telecommunications in emergencies</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures form a key part of the Government' s $650 million program for locally-led bushfire recovery and will increase network resilience and preparedness so communities can better deal with future emergencies and natural disasters. Further information on the package is available at www.communications.gov.au/phone/improving-resilience-australias-telco-networks. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to understand that no communications technology can provide 100 per cent resilience, as any communication system can be temporarily affected by adverse conditions, particularly during a power outage or natural disaster. It is therefore strongly recommended that, as part of effective emergency preparation and planning, people do not rely on a single form of communication or source of information during an emergency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The New South Wales Rural Fire Service website provides guidance on how to best plan and prepare for the bushfire season, including advice about where to find information and check for warnings and alerts. Further information is available at www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/plan-and-prepare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill 2019 will amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to provide better protections for consumers from small amount credit contracts, commonly known as payday loans, and consumer leases, commonly known as rent-to-buy schemes. The bill will impose a cap on rent-to-buy schemes, require payday loans to have equal repayment amounts and payment intervals, remove monthly fee charges where the payday loan has been repaid early and in full, prevent marketing of rent-to-buy schemes at people's homes, create stronger laws to ensure compliance and increase penalties for noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that all sounds very familiar to members in this House, it's because in this place we have tried time and time again to bring about these reforms, including the government showing an interest in these reforms at one stage. I remind honourable members that it was way back in 2015 that the federal government announced a review of payday lending laws and regulated consumer leases, and it organised for an inquiry to be conducted. The final report of that inquiry was handed down in March 2016. One thing led to another, and the government released an exposure draft of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill 2017 late in that year. However, that bill never came to fruition. In addition to the government's early effort, there have been numerous attempts by the opposition and by crossbenchers, both in this place and in the other place, all of which have failed to progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief that, after so much talk and so much effort by so many people, we still have not provided the protection for consumers that they desperately need and will need even more as we go into the post-pandemic world and as government income support payments are reduced. Experts, including ASIC in front of Senate estimates just recently, have made the point that there will be likely an increased reliance by consumers on payday loans and rent-to-buy schemes. So, frankly, it beggars belief that we are not onto this. Really, there's no good reason that, if we really did want to bring about this reform, we couldn't have this bill through both houses of parliament in this sitting fortnight. That would be the right thing to do by the community. That would mean we would go into next year, when government support payments are reducing, with greater protection for consumers. Let's not forget: this is about members of the community. I could stand up here and give countless examples of the harm that these payday loans and rent-to-buy schemes are causing. I have limited time, but I'll give one or two examples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the case study of a single mother, with three children, whose main income is from Centrelink. She was lonely at night and began gambling online, which she funded via obtaining payday loans from eight different online payday lenders. The bank statements she provided when applying for those loans clearly showed where she was spending her money: on gambling. In fact, most of the money on those statements was clearly going to other payday lenders for gambling and also to a debt collection agency. On the consumer checklist, the lender Ferratum made a number of false claims, and she continued to be issued loans. When Ferratum eventually declined her a loan, they sent her request to another payday lender, Cigno, without her permission. Cigno then advanced her a loan. She approached her bank, Westpac, and asked them to cancel her direct debits to payday lenders, but Westpac refused, saying she would need to contact them directly even though banks can cancel direct debits. When this unfortunate woman finally engaged a counsellor, she was struggling with bills and life in general. She became homeless and remains homeless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have another quick example. A 17-year-old, who had been diagnosed with psychosis and has been homeless for over six months, applied and was approved for a payday loan of $250 to cover her daily expenses. However, she was hospitalised due to a deterioration in her mental health and was in recovery for several months. Over that year her debt, which started at $250, escalated to $770 with fees and interest added each week. I'm pleased to report that after engaging a financial counsellor this person was able to get the debt waived on account of the irresponsible lending from the service provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on and on and on about this issue, and I'm sure honourable members in this place have heard many examples themselves. It beggars belief why we're not doing this. But not only are we not bringing about these reforms; the government wants to go one worse and actually wind back responsible lending laws. The government's National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Supporting Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 will scrap responsible lending laws for banks which were introduced after the GFC, shifting back to a 'borrower beware' model, even though a coalition of 125 peak financial institutions have come out strongly opposing these changes. I'm painting a pretty grim picture here. I'm painting a picture of a government that five years ago indicated an interest in cracking down on payday loans and has done nothing about it. I'm painting a picture of a government that not only is doing nothing about payday and rent-to-buy schemes but is now ploughing ahead with cutting back on the very sensible consumer credit protections that were introduced after the GFC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we're forgetting what our job is in this place. It's to help, support and protect our constituents. I make the point again: I'm sure I could get the opposition to support this private member's bill. The opposition, to its credit, has tried to progress these matters on a number of occasions in the past. Through you, Speaker, I call on the government to get behind this private member's bill. Let's see it through both houses of parliament over this sitting fortnight so that when the community goes into 2021, as government income support washes off and people are at risk from these predators even more, they have the protections they need. In my remaining time, I invite the member for Mayo, who is generously seconding this bill and has done a lot of work in this space herself over several years, to make a few additional comments.</span>

I can't think of a bill that has been presented to the parliament more than this bill. The government talked about it. Labor have presented their private member's bill. It's been presented in the Senate. I have presented it. I think the former member for Indi actually presented a bill, and now it's the member for Clark.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are letting Australians down when we don't act with respect to predatory payday lending. I actually want to touch on something that is related to payday lending, and that is Afterpay. Afterpay is a tsunami waiting to happen. We had a 90 per cent increase in use in the last year. We had one in five consumers using Afterpay receiving late fees, and, when they need to take out a loan to pay those late fees, where do they go? They go to get a small loan credit contract, and then they pay up to a 200 per cent increase. We're talking about $43 million in late fees with respect to Afterpay. We need to do work in this place with respect to Afterpay and with respect to payday lending. We are doing the greatest of disservice to Australians by not acting. The fact is that this is the government's own legislation and for many years now frustrated members of parliament have taken the government's own work into this place and said, 'C'mon, let's work on this; let's do this together,' yet we don't even have enough members in the chamber here to make quorum. It's a shame. We need to do better in this place on this very important work. I urge the government to actually make it happen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister keeps making announcements about them—he promised they'd be home by Christmas—but it's all spin. The queue just gets longer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The marketing department over there that masquerades as a government blames the states and quarantine capacity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is ever the Prime Minister's responsibility. He's just a powerless and impotent little man, a daggy dad in a baseball cap—until there's credit to be snatched then he pops up on TV and wraps himself in the flag.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, the Morrison government is itself wasting precious quarantine places, by forcing the partners of Australian citizens—people who are already safe here in Australia—to make risky and expensive return trips overseas just so the computer will spit out their partner visa.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And saving people from risking their health and exposure to COVID-19 overseas, and trashing their savings on an expensive, pointless trip.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has known about this problem for months and I honestly don't know why the minister has failed to fix it. Seriously. It's not rocket science even for this mob.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But after a year of failure all we get now is a vague announcement on a Saturday night that he might start thinking about it next year. It's government by spin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of providing certainty to the thousands of Australians and their loved ones who have waited years for their visas, Saturday's announcement raises more questions than it answers. Who will be eligible? When will they be eligible? What happens in the meantime? Do they renew their visitor visa? Who's going to pay for their renewed health and character checks?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Goodness only knows what Minister Tudge has been up to, but it certainly isn't fixing the basic problems in his portfolio. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister should know that not everyone finds love on the dance floor or in their office or in the city or region they grew up in. Not everyone finds love in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quintessentially Australian to fall in love with someone from overseas and bring them here to build a life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to stop other couples from having to go through what Amelia and Bowie went through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They met in 2016, they got married and, effectively, have lived together in Australia for a year now while they've waited and waited and waited and waited for Bowie's visa to be granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They finally heard a few months ago that Bowie's visa was ready and they could formally start their life here in Australia. Bowie would have work rights and be able to contribute fully to the community and to their family, but he had to go outside Australia to get his visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, a bit over a week ago, Amelia and Bowie wasted over $6,000 on a return trip to Singapore for Bowie, just so the government would grant his visa. The plane had literally been in the air for less than 40 minutes when the email notifying approval of Bowie's visa came through to Amelia, but he still had to go on to Singapore because of this government's failure to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, as I speak, Bowie is hanging out, by himself, in quarantine in Perth. That's one less quarantine place for a stranded Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the risk of contracting COVID, travelling internationally is too expensive for most couples now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amelia actually sold her flat, her only asset, to fund Bowie's partner visa application, his visitor visa fees, the migration fees, the legal fees and now this trip. They've spent over $37,000. They have literally trashed their savings, and start their lives together in debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But finally with this visa Bowie will have work rights and be able to fully contribute. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister: will couples like Bowie and Amelia be compensated for your failure to act for an entire year?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Will the minister have the courage to come in here and stand up in parliament and apologise to untold hundreds or thousands of couples who've been in exactly that situation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many couples can't afford to spend thousands of dollars to get their partner visa granted; they've already spent over 20 grand on the visa and legal fees alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are numerous people in my electorate in this situation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from couples where the partner is from the UK, being forced to fly out on a round trip to the UK, risking COVID and wasting $15,000 on a business class airfare, which are the only seats available that you have any hope of getting home on—while thousands of Aussies are stranded in the UK, wanting to come home and use that quarantine place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the minister for months. I've spoken to the assistant minister. I've spoken to many government ministers about this for months. They knew about this problem, yet they did nothing until Saturday night when they got a negative media story and knew this debate was coming on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the most common and worrying cases are for couples where the partner's from India.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One couple, let's call them Jatinder and Amrit, are in an impossible situation. Jatinder's pregnant and their first child is actually due in two days, this Wednesday. She was told on 9 March that her visa was ready to be granted, but she's been unable to leave Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Initially, the COVID border restrictions prevented her flying out, then they couldn't get flights and now she's too pregnant to leave. Jatinder's about to give birth to an Australian child. She's on a bridging visa she doesn't need to be on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date this couple have spent $12,000 on visa related expenses. Unless the rule is changed, Jatinder and their newborn baby will be flying to a country which recently recorded over nine million COVID-19 cases, before flying back to Australia to spend two weeks alone with her baby in quarantine. It's ridiculous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have no options to leave Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Either their passports don't let them travel to the few places you can fly to at the moment, there are no flights, they can't afford it or they have commitments—normal life stuff that prevents them from going overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These couples are stuck in an ongoing nightmare of uncertainty, trapped in this endless loop of applying for visitor visa after visitor visa, coughing up more money to the Department of Home Affairs just to ensure they remain in Australia lawfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As time passes, they have to keep forking out more money: not just for more visas but to ensure their documents are up to date, because if you get a police check or a medical clearance it only lasts for a few months. So while the governments goes round in circles making announcements, there are thousands of people in Australia having to fork out more and more money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister: will you compensate the many Australians who've wasted an extra $7,700 to lodge a second partner visa application onshore to be confident that, eventually, in a few years from now, they'll get the visa?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a money-making scam by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's announcement is too little, too late for thousands of Australians and their loved ones. It's all announcement and no delivery. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless the minister acts this week, precious quarantine places will still be wasted, punishing the 36,000 Australians stranded overseas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister may well claim this bill is now redundant and that I and the Labor Party can declare victory for our months-long campaign for pushing him to finally take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But an announcement is not taking action. It's just more spin and marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, of course, only deals with one small part of the problem: this huge mess that the government has made of the partner visa program through its illegal delays in processing applications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are nearly 100,000 Australians who've been affected, and tens of thousands are still separated right now from their loved ones with no hope in sight. Their application has been swallowed by the black hole that is the Department of Home Affairs. What about the people on 300 prospective marriage visas? When are they going to be with the person that they love? I've been deluged by cases of women in their late 30s and early 40s, literally telling me their biological clock is ticking and they will never be able to come to Australia and start their family. If government members want to smirk about that, I will show them the emails. These are real people with real lives. It's not just an academic question. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister should have sacked this minister months ago and found someone to do the job.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year on 1 December we celebrate and recognise World AIDS Day, which is obviously a day that we would all rather not have to celebrate and recognise, but it's an opportunity to recognise those people all around the world who have HIV and to raise awareness about the challenges facing those with HIV and AIDS—in the past, today and in the future. World AIDS Day is a day for people to show their support for people living with HIV and to commemorate people who have died.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we celebrate World AIDS Day under the banner of Now More Than Ever because it's an opportunity to end the stigma, support treatment and get to zero transmissions. Unlike other countries, Australia has a very proud record. We have had a bipartisan spirit to combatting the spread of HIV from the outset, and the outcomes are very clear. At the end of 2018 Australia had an estimated 28,180 people living with HIV infection, representing 0.14 per cent prevalence overall as a proportion of Australians living with HIV. Of course, we have continued to roll out important and critical programs since the very onset of HIV in the 1980s to stop transmission, whether it's needle exchanges, access to vital or critical medicines and, more recently, medicines that enable people to engage in safe sexual practices. There were 833 HIV notifications in Australia in 2018, the lowest number of notifications since 2001, with a 23 per cent decline over the last five years and a 13 per cent decline between 2017 and 2018. Of those, an estimated 90 per cent were diagnosed. And, of those, 96 per cent were retained in care and 89 per cent were receiving antiretroviral therapy. And, of those receiving antiretroviral therapy, 95 per cent had a suppressed viral load, a clear reminder that one of the biggest and most important things to reduce the risk of transmission is to know your status.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's HIV epidemic continues to be predominately in men who have sex with men, and recent declines in HIV notifications have been attributed to fewer new diagnoses in this critical group. But they are not alone, of course. Among those who inject drugs, there has been a very low prevalence of HIV as a result of a highly successful harm reduction strategy for many years now. There remain some challenges, particularly in the context of making sure there isn't transmission among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and among foreign students living in Australia, who may not have access to all medications. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Morrison government has made it a continuing priority to make sure that there is proper resourcing available for the many community organisations and health groups to continue to fight transmission. On World AIDS Day 2019, additional ongoing support of $2.9 million in 2020-21 was provided to support the national peak organisation to assist priority populations and healthcare professionals in response to bloodborne viruses and STIs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National HIV Strategy notes that access to HIV treatments for Medicare-ineligible people is an important action to reach priority populations and reduce transmissions every day. That's why, under this Minister for Health, we have continued to list new medications and provide more access and treatment options for Australians to reduce the risk of transmission to others and to themselves. The National HIV Strategy provides a framework for the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments, coordinated with a national response, to address HIV in Australia. And we can get to an Australia that has virtually eliminated HIV, but we can't do so in isolation as a government; we can do it with the work of so many community organisations, led by groups like the National Association of People with HIV, and the Federation of AIDS Organisations. All of these community groups, supported by, importantly, healthcare workers, provide assistance and support to those in need and make sure that we can reduce the risk and achieve virtually zero transmission.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I second the motion. I'd like to thank the member for Goldstein for moving this motion. I would like to recognise that tomorrow is World AIDS Day and I'd like to acknowledge and give my thoughts to all those that we have lost from AIDS related conditions and also those who are living with HIV. The theme for World AIDS Day this year is Now More Than Ever, and this is vitally important. It's important to acknowledge that Australia has done remarkably well. I'd like to acknowledge some of the leaders in this field in Australia: Professor Ron Penny; and Professor David Cooper, from the Kirby Institute, who passed away earlier this year. I acknowledge their efforts to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS related conditions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't want my speech to be a history lesson in particular, but I was a registrar in the early 1980s and I well remember the fear about what was happening. In this pandemic year, it's important to remember that we went through very similar public health concerns with HIV in the early eighties, and our response to HIV-AIDS taught us many things that were put into practice in this pandemic year. The first thing that the HIV epidemic taught us was that science is important—that we must listen to the scientists. It also taught us that we can all come together in a public health campaign and work for the common good. The third thing it taught us is that politicians are indeed capable of working together for the common good. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge Peter Baum, the Liberal government's health minister in 1982; and Neal Blewett, who was the Hawke Labor government's health minister in 1983, and what they did to raise awareness and promote the public health campaigns in the early eighties that enabled Australia's response to be so good. Really, we have done remarkably well. Now more than ever, we need to concentrate on preventing transmission, on better treatments and on the Holy Grail: an immunisation for HIV. Australia will continue to do well as long as we remember this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate all those who work in the field of HIV prevention. We know that there are still many people—over 28,000 in Australia—living with HIV. But that's the point: people now live with HIV rather than die with HIV. I well remember the children with haemophilia, thalassaemia and other blood related conditions, and indeed those with leukaemia, who received multiple transmissions and who succumbed to HIV in the early eighties, many of whom I cared for in my time at the children's hospital. I remember Eve van Grafhorst, a little baby who developed AIDS following transmission as a neonate, and the stigma that was attached to her infection and actually drove her from Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remember the past if we are going to progress in the future. We must remove our own inhibitions and our own fears and constraints in continuing this very important public health campaign. In particular, I congratulate the New South Wales government and eventually the federal government for supporting PrEP treatment for those at risk of HIV and for their continuing efforts in HIV education and prevention of transmission. We should also thank those that work internationally, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to prevent infectious diseases in countries with poor public health facilities. Australia is a key partner in supporting the global fund to prevent HIV transmission in our near neighbours. We need continued, sustained funding from the Commonwealth government. I commend this motion to the parliament, and I thank the member for Goldstein for bringing it to us, but the fight goes on until we have zero HIV transmission. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  Tomorrow, on 1 December, we will mark World AIDS Day, to raise awareness of the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS as well as to pay tribute to those who have tragically lost their lives to AIDS related conditions. The national World AIDS Day theme for 2020 is 'Now More Than Ever'. The success of antiretroviral drugs and extremely low HIV-to-AIDS progression rates make it easy to forget the devastating scar that the HIV-AIDS epidemic left on Australian society not so long ago. We remember those who lost their lives as a result of contracting HIV, and we continue to work to reduce the rate of transmission and risk for others. In many communities across our country, HIV and AIDS continue to be a source of great pain, tragedy and discrimination. The issues and stigma associated with HIV and AIDS remain a present problem to be addressed. Now more than ever, we do need to better educate ourselves and our communities about HIV, take action to reduce the transmission and ensure support for those living with the condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 833 HIV notifications in Australia in 2018, the lowest number of notifications since 2001. An estimated 90 per cent were diagnosed. In addition to this, 77 per cent of people living with HIV in Australia achieved a suppressed viral load. This is the first time Australia has reached the UNAIDS 2020 target of 73 per cent. These statistics are promising, and they paint a picture of progress. There has been a decrease in new transmissions and decreased stigma surrounding HIV, so more people feel that they can be tested and seek treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent declines in HIV notifications have been attributed to fewer diagnoses in the gay and bisexual men community, and I'd like to commend the LGBTQIA community leaders and organisations that have worked tirelessly to advocate, to educate and to raise awareness of HIV. Their work has ensured that there are fewer barriers to treatment and less risk of transmission. It's good news that HIV prevalence continues to be very low among those who inject drugs as a result of highly successful harm-reduction strategies. The incidence of HIV among women involved in sex work is extremely low due to the successful promotion and adoption of safer sex practices, and lower rates of maternal transmission have been achieved through comprehensive medical interventions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this hard-won progress gives us optimism, the coalition government is committed to seeing HIV eliminated in Australia. Further action is needed to address the rising HIV transmission among our First Nations people, trans and gender diverse people and other emerging high-risk groups. Sadly, there has not been a decrease in HIV notifications among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or people acquiring HIV through heterosexual sex. The Morrison government will continue its work to reduce and eliminate the transmission of HIV. In the 2019-20 budget, $45.4 million was allocated over three years to implement Australia's five national bloodborne viruses and STI strategies. The strategies were developed in partnership with state and territory health departments, non-government organisations, affected communities, research organisations and medical professionals in a cooperative approach to address HIV. It is important that our strategies to eliminate HIV put evidence based practices and people at the centre. As we mark World AIDS Day tomorrow, it is my hope that all Australians look to the significant progress made in our fight to eliminate HIV and AIDS to inspire ongoing research and advocacy. </span>

It's almost 40 years since the first case of HIV-AIDS in Australia was recorded in Sydney. It was around this time—in October of 1982—as the summer drew closer and the weather grew warmer and everyone prepared for that inevitable wind-down and to spend time with friends and family over the holidays. They weren't to know that a spectre was looming over the gay community in Australia at that time—one that would devastate friends and loved ones for decades to come. What we now call HIV-AIDS had been first reported in the United States a year earlier, but no-one knew what it was, let alone what caused it or how to treat it. There were many names for it and many of them attached a stigma to the gay community and to gay men, in particular: gay related immune deficiency, or GRID; or just the 'gay plague' were common references at the time. If you talk to a member of the community or even a friend or loved one who lived through the epidemic, they will tell you of the unimaginable terror and dread that permeated in these dark times. They'll tell you of the fear that came from living in a world where you woke up every day wondering who in your community would be next and whether this would be the last time that you saw someone that you loved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, HIV-AIDS is not the death sentence it was in those times. While we don't have a cure or, indeed, a vaccine, we have made significant progress in the fight against HIV-AIDS. We have powerful antiretroviral medication to treat it and we have the latest advancement in PrEP, which has been supported by state governments in Victoria and New South Wales—truly a remarkable drug that has taken a lot of fear out of the community. But the journey wasn't easy, and we didn't get there overnight. Treating HIV-AIDS with the limited knowledge available at the time wasn't popular or even something that some doctors were willing to do. Out of fear, many HIV-AIDS patients were turned away from doctor's surgeries and hospitals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The homophobia directed towards gay men in this period, even those who hadn't been diagnosed with HIV-AIDS, was a barrier to treatment and progress in fighting the disease. My family experienced this hate and suffering firsthand, and we, along with many others who experienced it, carry the scars of this period with us to this day—scars that will never quite heal. It was only the actions of a small group of people who refused to bow to this prejudice, who focused on the science and the medicine rather than the fear, that provided the hope and the will to find a way out of the crisis. The activists, particularly in the gay community, who stood up and said, 'This isn't right', tirelessly campaigned, despite the stigma, for government to listen to the experts and campaigned to educate the community. It's these people that I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two people in particular were the shining light of the health response: Neal Blewett, the health minister at the time in the Hawke government; and Bill Bowtell, his adviser. It was Blewett who, on the advice of Bowtell, established the National Advisory Committee on AIDS and adopted an approach which was radical for the times—listening to those most immediately affected by the disease and giving them a say in policymaking on HIV-AIDS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Blewett and Bowtell faced significant opposition to this approach. Bowtell writes in a brief account:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We were told promoting the rights (and responsibilities) of those with HIV/AIDS was irresponsible and would accelerate the spread of the virus. But it turned out that the reverse was true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… importantly, a new model for dealing with other diseases was created, and shown to work outstandingly well. It is a legacy of which we can all be proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Bowtell said of Australia's response: 'It was bold, radical and right.' It's a response that has gone on to become a leading model for how we fight pandemics around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An inspiring story of the time is that of Sister Angela Mary Doyle, of the Sisters of Mercy in Queensland. In defiance of the Bjelke-Petersen government, Sister Angela Mary Doyle secretly funnelled federal government money to the Queensland AIDS Council through the Mater Hospital. For this, Neal Blewett labelled the Sisters of Mercy 'the most altruistic of money launderers'. It was acts of courage, empathy and community like this in a time when fear and uncertainty divided many in our community that helped us get through to the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is that we find ourselves marking World AIDS Day at the end of 2020—a year that has seen us grappling with a different health crisis that has also seen some seek to divide our community. Again we have turned to experts like Dr Bill Bowtell AO, now an adjunct professor at UNSW's Kirby Institute, to guide us with a response that is no longer radical, just bold and right—one based not on fear but on sound health principles. As we approach 40 years since the first HIV-AIDS case was reported we can't be complacent. The global death toll from AIDS related illnesses now stands at 32.7 million. We must continue HIV-AIDS awareness and prevention campaigns both in Australia and globally, particularly amongst our First Nations people. In our region, where there were 300,000 new HIV infections last year, we must continue to provide support in the form of foreign aid to our neighbours. The job is not over. We must come together to continue the work on both sides of politics to end HIV transmission in Australia.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHARMA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  On World AIDS Day tomorrow, Tuesday 1 December, we stand in solidarity with the people in Australia and around the world living with HIV and AIDS. As we recommit ourselves to ending this epidemic we also remember the friends and loved ones we've lost along the way. We also recall the tremendous efforts of peer educators, healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists in developing treatment and prevention regimes which have drastically improved the lives of people living with HIV. Thankfully, due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV is now in most cases a manageable chronic condition rather than a fatal diagnosis. However, there remains significant work to be done to end the stigma that too many people living with HIV still face and to ensure that everyone can get the care they deserve. Of the 38 million people worldwide living with HIV, only 25.4 million are accessing antiretroviral therapy—accounting for only 67 per cent of people living with HIV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a difficult year in 2020, with all of us confronted with the harsh realities of illness in one way or another. The COVID-19 pandemic, a pandemic of another communicable disease, has had a devastating impact on global health security. Whilst the global death toll from COVID-19 now stands at around 1.4 million, the imminence of vaccines means that an end to this communicable disease is now in sight. The other significant communicable disease, HIV-AIDS, still kills some 950,000 people each and every year, year after year, with a global death toll of around 32 million. That's why this year's theme of World AIDS Day is now more than ever a call to refocus our work alongside the risks of COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the UNAIDS 2020 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Seizing the moment</span>, stated that the COVID-19 pandemic could delay progress to meet international targets by up to a decade—a worrying forecast if we are to end the HIV epidemic by 2030 as we hope. However, with the right focus and the right resources the virtual elimination of HIV is within our reach, with the number of new diagnoses progressively declining to its lowest level in nearly 20 years. Nonetheless, our work is far from complete. We are not seeing a decline in the rates of transmission amongst First Nations people, trans and gender diverse people and other emerging high-risk population groups. These communities are part of the solution to reducing transmission, and we must develop innovative solutions to reach these populations. This also means implementing services aimed at populations who find it difficult to interact with our healthcare system, such as those living in Australia who do not have access to Medicare. In Australia, in particular, gay and bisexual men continue to bear the burden of Australia's HIV epidemic, and ongoing health education and awareness among this population group is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Globally, COVID-19 has underscored how vital it is that Australia support our friends in the Pacific towards their goals of eliminating transmission of HIV-AIDS. Almost six million people live with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region and, with COVID-19 threatening access to healthcare services, it's more important than ever that we protect the health and prosperity of our region. Australia is working closely with longstanding partners like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNAIDS to invest in HIV prevention the Indo-Pacific. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's theme also reminds us of the importance of community, from providing supportive networks to ensure that no-one is left behind to encouraging people to get tested and connecting them with treatment. Advocates and grassroots organisations change lives for the better, offering invaluable peer-to-peer education while fighting for sustainable and reliable services for people living with HIV. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's bipartisan approach to tackling this health issue has been impressive and instrumental in the fight against HIV-AIDS, I commend the work of the Parliamentary Friends for Action on HIV/AIDS, Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Infections and its chairs, Tim Wilson, the member for Goldstein; and Senator Louise Pratt, for their efforts in bringing this to the forefront of public consciousness. This issue is bigger than politics and it will take efforts from all sides of politics to see meaningful improvement. I encourage everyone to raise awareness about HIV-AIDS and challenge the misconceptions that lead to stigma. Together we can end this global epidemic and ensure that everyone has the care and support they need to live full and healthy lives. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of this motion and congratulate the member for Goldstein for moving it. HIV does not discriminate; people do. As UNAIDS has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Stigma and discrimination will continue to exist so long as societies as a whole continue to judge people with HIV.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it could be said that stigma and discrimination will continue to exist so long as societies as a whole continue to judge anyone who is different. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As speakers before me have said, Australia was at the forefront of a bold, innovative public health approach to combating HIV-AIDS. As someone who grew up in the eighties, I remember, even as a young girl in country New South Wales, the fear that society had about people who had HIV-AIDS and I remember the public health campaigns telling people that it could happen to anyone and it wasn't just gay men who were susceptible to catching HIV and developing AIDS. We are rightly proud in Australia of the fact that we took the advice of scientists, we took the advice of people living with the fear and living with the risk of catching the disease and we devised a public health strategy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's national theme for World AIDS Day 2020 is Now More Than Ever. Now more than ever, we need to continue to focus on the science, to listen to the advocates and to make sure that we continue to work to eliminate stigma and discrimination and that we don't take our eye off the ultimate goal, and that is eliminating HIV-AIDS from society. UNAIDS's theme for World AIDS Day 2020 is Global Solidarity, Shared Responsibility. It's a theme that really reflects 2020 as a whole. UNAIDS leads the global effort to end AIDS as a public health threat and has a goal of doing so by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. The idea is to stop new infections; to make sure that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment; and to protect and promote human rights, because fundamental to the public health approach started in the eighties and continuing today is an acknowledgement of human rights—people's right to access health care, no matter who they are or where they live. UNAIDS also focuses on producing data for decision-making because, as I've said, HIV can affect anyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">UNAIDS has an approach of prevailing against pandemics by putting people at the centre. We've seen how that approach has also been adopted in dealing with COVID-19 in many—not all, but many—countries around the world, putting people at the centre, putting public health at the centre of a response. So UNAIDS is calling on countries to make greater investments in global pandemic responses and to adopt a new set of bold, ambitious but achievable HIV targets. I hark back to the fact that Australia took a bold and ambitious public health approach in the 1980s with the advice of Bill Bowtell AO, who is still out there pushing scientific responses to epidemics. That's the approach that UNAIDS is calling on countries to do now. It wants us to set targets and then work to meet those targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAIDS, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The collective failure to invest sufficiently in comprehensive, rights-based, people-centred HIV responses has come at a terrible price … Implementing just the most politically palatable programmes will not turn the tide against COVID-19 or end AIDS. To get the global response back on track will require putting people first and tackling the inequalities on which epidemics thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen in Australia that COVID-19 has thrived on inequality. We must continue to listen to scientists, to put people at the heart of public health campaigns, to believe in and support human rights and to end inequalities. That is the formula for dealing with issues such as HIV and COVID-19.</span>

The theme for World AIDS Day 2020 is 'Now More Than Ever'. Since the first HIV diagnosis in Australia more than 30 years ago, our understanding around prevention, transmission and treatment of HIV has improved dramatically. But, despite the investment resulting in extraordinary advances in all of these areas, there is still more to do. As we fight to wrestle this terrible disease into extinction, now more than ever we need to ensure that the advances we have achieved are not lost. Now more than ever we need to ensure that those who need treatment can get it. Now more than ever we need to ensure that those who are at risk of disease take steps to prevent getting it. Now more than ever we must protect against the stigma that still exists within our communities to help save lives and to help protect lives.</span>

I work with many LGBTQI+ community groups, including great advocacy groups like Thorne Harbour Health. I'm proud to be a member of Liberal Pride. Higgins is also home to world-leading HIV-AIDS research. Professor Sharon Lewin, the director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, and also a local constituent, has been a leader in HIV-AIDS research. She leads a multidisciplinary research team working on mechanisms of HIV latency, clinical trials, advancing potential HIV cure strategies, and how HIV is affected by co-infections such as hepatitis B. She was central to bringing the International AIDS Conference to Melbourne in 2014 and was local co-chair. I'd like to also acknowledge the hard work of Professor Brendan Crabb AC, the director of the Burnet Institute, which is on the border of my electorate of Higgins. The Burnet's world-class sentinel surveillance system, ACCESS, is now rolled out across states and territories and is being used to monitor HIV related outcomes during the COVID pandemic.</span>

In the same year, there were 833 new HIV notifications, the lowest number since 2001. Of those diagnosed with HIV, 96 per cent were receiving care and 89 per cent were receiving retroviral therapy. Most importantly, 95 per cent of those receiving therapy had a suppressed viral load. This means that Australia has comfortably reached the UNAIDS' 2020 target that more than 73 per cent of those living with HIV have a suppressed viral load. This is an immense achievement that this country should be proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be proud of the PBS access to preventive treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis—commonly known as PrEP—that we provide to people at medium to high risk of HIV infection. By listing PrEP on the PBS, 32,000 Australians are subsidised each year. Without this subsidy, they would pay $2,500 a year, a cost that would be beyond the capability of many young patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">HIV can be a sensitive topic for many. So many in the LGBTI community have faced years of homophobia and inaccurate information regarding the risk of developing HIV and AIDS. It can be a topic some don't want to openly talk about. In 2020 a national survey of men who have sex with men found that 21 per cent of participants reported feeling stigmatised within the past year by other people assuming they had HIV. Another survey of the Australian public found 30 per cent of participants reported they behaved negatively towards people living with HIV. This shouldn't be happening. There should be no shame. That's why we need to talk about AIDS openly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are fortunate to have one of the best healthcare systems in the world. As a government we are fortunate to have the trust and respect of the Australian public as we seek to keep us all safe from emerging health threats. After all, now more than ever we all need to work together to help prevent and treat AIDS.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on this motion recognising that tomorrow is World AIDS Day. It is also my mother's birthday. Rest in peace, Mum. World AIDS Day is an annual day to acknowledge those who we've lost to AIDS related conditions and those who are living with HIV. The theme for this year's World AIDS Day is 'now more than ever'. Some 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Almost six million of those are living in our Asia-Pacific region. There were 1.7 million people diagnosed with HIV in 2019, compared to the peak of 2.8 million new diagnoses in 1998. This 40 per cent gradual reduction is testament to the global community's commitment and efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has made excellent progress towards our goal of eliminating HIV transmission by 2022. In Australia in 2018 there were 833 HIV notifications, down from 1,084 in 2014. This year so far 129 people have been diagnosed with HIV in Queensland. So HIV has not yet been eliminated. There is still much work to do. Despite a decrease in notifications in the wider Australian community, there have been rising rates of transmissions among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. I'm privileged to represent a diverse electorate. Moreton hosted a World AIDS Day multicultural forum in Acacia Ridge on the weekend. I went along and met with several local community leaders. This event is held every year by the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland, who received some health funding to hold the forum. This is the 20th year that the mighty ECCQ have held the event, which attracts community leaders from across Brisbane and is particularly aimed at multicultural communities. There were close to 100 attendees on Saturday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, as that cruel data suggests, there is complacency about HIV in some communities largely due to some in the community who have travelled here from overseas. Before arriving they were screened for HIV as part of the health requirement for receiving a visa. Once they were in Australia they heard very little about HIV as a day-to-day concern. We are a victim of our own success. It's not at the forefront as a health issue for many in the community like it was when AIDS first appeared. It was 1987 when the Grim Reaper campaign first aired on television screens. The impact of those ads was crucial in raising awareness of the emerging AIDS epidemic to prevent the spread. Very quickly everyone knew what AIDS was and how to protect yourself from getting it, and the health officials and the gay community groups were magnificent working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, there is not that level of awareness and action in all communities anymore. Forums like the one organised by the mighty Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland are very valuable. They provide good, reliable information to leaders so they can then return to their communities and share that information. The guest speaker on Saturday, Joe Hand, spoke about his experience of living with HIV since 2000. He talked about the stigma that still exists in multicultural communities. He said that he's often asked to speak at events such as the forum on Saturday, but he's the only person who speaks publicly. He hopes that next year he'll be in the audience listening to someone else speak publicly about their experience of living with HIV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Breaking down the stigma of HIV so that people talk about the disease and share knowledge is crucial in preventing its spread. We've seen the benefit this year of getting information into the community about protection from infection and stopping the spread. The efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic have enveloped the world and overshadowed the continuing efforts to beat the HIV epidemic. As did the AIDS epidemic in its early years, COVID-19 has exposed the inequalities that exist in our community. Millions of people in developing countries died waiting for HIV treatment. We've seen even here in Australia that some sectors of society have been less able to protect themselves from COVID-19—for example, the homeless, who could not isolate like the rest of us in our comfortable homes; those in aged care, whose carers were not provided with adequate PPE to stop the spread; or those in non-state-government run homes in Victoria, where, I think, about 95 per cent of the fatalities occurred, those without nurse-patient ratios. So 2020 has been a year like no other. We've done remarkably well to stop the spread of COVID, but we need to work more too. We can't be complacent about AIDS. The shared responsibility to increase awareness and stop HIV infection demonstrated by my local multicultural community shows that they will continue to work to eliminate HIV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to remember today the Australians who've lost their fight against AIDS related conditions. My brothers and my brother's partner, Michael Trelfer, have told me just some of those tragic stories, of the families and friends who fought that fight with them. You are not forgotten. We will all keep fighting and we will remember those names. I repeat: we do not want COVID-19 to threaten the great progress that has been made in beating HIV.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I'd like to thank the tens of thousands of workers at Services Australia. They've been staffing our national safety net during the COVID-19 pandemic. We regularly and rightly acknowledge our doctors and other frontline health workers, our aged-care workers and our disability care workers. But perhaps less present at the front of our mind are the myriad of workers who are helping Australians in their hour of financial need. So I want to say thank you to the people who work at Services Australia, formerly Centrelink. It is a workforce that deals with people often at their most stressed, emotional and strung out. Losing a job is a grieving period. It feels like a kick in the guts. It is stressful. It is a shock to people: families not knowing how to make the rent and wondering how they'll pay for the budget and what meals they will have to skip so their kids don't. Centrelink has been dealing recently with a mass influx of people who are not used to being on the social security queues. People have lost their jobs or lost hours of work. They are economic victims of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These Centrelink workers are a workforce who are often not in control of the resources that their government gives them. They are a workforce on which this current government has imposed an arbitrary staffing cap. This led prior to the pandemic to the usual problems of mass workloads, casualisation, outsourcing and the loss of corporate knowledge. But this year, on top of the last number of difficult years, has perhaps been the biggest for Services Australia in living memory, from dealing with the bushfire response across much of Australia in December and January to managing the surge, the tsunami, in new applicants for JobSeeker allowance that arose through March and April. These are rewarding frontline service jobs, but they are undoubtedly tough. The members of this staff, this workforce, deserve our gratitude for their efforts, particularly over the last few months. For more than four years, this battered workforce has repeatedly raised concerns about the robodebt debt-raising scandal, only to have them ignored by those more senior in government. This government was determined to harass, bully and unlawfully intimidate hundreds of thousands of Australians just so it could prop up its budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government had the opportunity to transform the culture of Centrelink when we debated legislation to establish Services Australia in this chamber earlier this year. They had the opportunity to reconsider their ways at the start of the pandemic and to provide good-quality, secure jobs by supporting Labor's principled amendments to abolish the arbitrary staffing cap imposed by this government. Instead, we've seen this government, even at the height of the pandemic, sack over 400 workers from Serco and Datacom just a month ago. People who had worked up to two years acquiring knowledge were just shoved out the door. Imagine thanking the hardworking people who've been carrying the workload during the pandemic by sacking them. Imagine cutting their contracts with 10 days notice and letting them loose without any permanent leave or redundancy. The staffing cap was placed across the public sector in 2013 without weighing up the capabilities and requirements of every agency or department. The staffing cap is a cut in real staffing numbers. It is a privatisation policy by stealth. Agencies are forced to outsource, contract out, spend exorbitant amounts on consultants and engage labour hire contractors to make up for a lack of in-house resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I say thank you to the Services Australia staff, I want to say that help is on its way if Labor wins the next election, and I sincerely hope that we will. Labor believes that human services delivery should be defined by fair and equal government services for all citizens. Labor in government will build a human services delivery system that is crisis capable, one equipped with resources to deal with national disasters of all descriptions on an ongoing basis. Labor believes that the design of government services should place people at the centre. We will embrace new technologies to provide convenient, more efficient and more effective delivery of services, but these will be supported by access to face-to-face services and in-person support where people need and want this. Under Labor, technology and service delivery will always use appropriate oversight, appropriate levels of checking and meaningful human engagement. We will not use technology to override the rights of individuals. We will not use technology to create a digital workhouse for the poor and the vulnerable. We'll provide proper dignity. We should have faith—Australians should have faith—that we have a crisis-capable system in our social security safety net. We believe in actual human service. Services Australia workers, we respect your contribution. Thank you very much.</span>

                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  Thank you to the member for Maribyrnong for bringing forward this important and apolitical debate today. At the end of any year, it's normal to look back and reflect on what has happened, but of course 2020 was no normal year. From drought to bushfires and, of course, the pandemic, this year has been like no other. But underscoring all these things has been one common thread: hardship. Millions of Australians have had their lives turned upside down this year. People have lost work, families have struggled to put food on the table and people have been at their wits' end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people are facing times like these, they turn to the government. Thankfully, the government has been here to help. As at 13 November 2020, over $8.9 billion has been paid in economic support payments across both rounds, as well as $16 billion paid in coronavirus supplement. Since 16 March 2020, more than 1.8 million JobSeeker claims have been finalised. Additionally, pandemic leave, disaster payments, childcare changes, pauses in debt recovery and one-off pension payments have all helped Australians through these tough times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But none of these reforms would have made any difference without the incredible staff at Services Australia to help those who need it most. Staff from Services Australia have been working to deliver new and improved income support measures and fast-track the Australian government's coronavirus financial support. While people were staying at home to stay safe, Services Australia stayed open to ensure that everyone who needed help could access them, even if they didn't have access to a phone or the internet. Throughout the pandemic 80 per cent of Services Australia's workers remained in their offices, and the sheer numbers of those who are working is incredible. At the peak of demand, April 2020, almost 12,000 staff were assisting the agency to manage its response to COVID-19. This comprised of 3,414 redeployed Services Australia employees; over 1,700 redeployed employees from at least 37 different APS departments and agencies; 6,774 new employees, including 1,546 non-ongoing and casual employees; 3,125 labour hire employees; and 2,103 employees through our services delivery partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019-20, the agency processed almost five million social security and welfare claims—that's over 1.4 million more claims than would normally have been processed and equates to around 10 claims processed every minute. This financial year, as of 6 November 2020, the agency has processed almost 1.9 million social security claims, almost 70 per cent more claims processed when compared with the same period last financial year. The agency also answered over 1.1 million more social security and welfare calls than in the previous financial year. As of 6 November 2020, the agency is processing the majority of social security and welfare claims in less than a week, and the average speed of answer for social security and welfare calls is 86 seconds. This is incredible not just for the processing times but more importantly for the comfort and certainty that this sort of efficiency brings to people who are having their worlds turned upside down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia have also invested heavily in their digital capacity through the myGov system. It now has capacity to support 300,000 concurrent users, up from approximately 90,000 concurrent users, which has been essential this year. From average daily sign-ins of 503,000 in the financial year, myGov has rapidly increased to average daily sign-ins of 741,000, primarily due to COVID-19. The busiest day saw over four million sign-ins into myGov accounts compared to the previous record of 1.8 million logins during the July tax time peak last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to end by thanking everyone who has been working tirelessly at Services Australia across the country, particularly in Bennelong. Nathan and his team at Ryde do incredible work to ensure that everyone in Bennelong has access to the government services they need, and we cannot thank them enough. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the shadow minister's motion, acknowledging the fantastic work of Services Australia. 2020 has been an unbelievably challenging year for so many Australians, and it is the role and responsibility of Services Australia to be there for Australians when they need support and assistance in their time of need. For many it will be the first time they have needed this help, help to put food on the table, pay the bills and pay for the school shoes. In response the staff at Services Australia have done a fantastic job under extremely difficult circumstances, and it is right this House recognises that contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I salute the employees and leadership at Services Australia. Their hard work has kept so many safe and secure through a year that so many will be happy to see end. This year has seen Services Australia launch an online intent-to-claim function through the myGov portal. This function has made it easier to register for desperately needed financial supports. It also eliminates the need for applicants to wait on hold or online to access Services Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The myGov portal has also been upgraded. The previous capacity of 6,000 users at one time was lifted in March to 40,000 and then to 150,000. In a single day in March, myGov facilitated 2.6 million logins. By comparison the previous busiest day ever was during the 2019 tax concession season, which saw 1.8 million logins, 800,000 fewer than 25 March of this year. Services Australia also announced 5,000 extra staff in the first quarter of this year. These staff helped to roll out more services faster to Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this work must be recognised and applauded. Services Australia employees should be proud of what they've achieved this year. It must be said that Services Australia will always be necessary. It is important that the staff continue to deliver services at a high standard for our country. But the Morrison government's plan for the future will put too much pressure on this organisation. In the budget the government released two months ago they planned for unemployment to be worse next year than it was at the peak of the pandemic. This is their plan: they intend to withdraw economic supports before the economy has recovered. On 6 October the Morrison government printed in black and white their intention to keep unemployment well above five per cent for the next four years. They plan for about one million Australians to be unemployed this year, next year and the year after that. That is their plan, and this is a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So while I pay tribute today to the amazing work that Services Australia staff have done over 2020 I also want to stress one extremely important message: this government should not be planning on keeping that many Australians out of employment. No government should ever plan to keep that many citizens out of employment. In setting this strategy the government is planning for more suffering and increasing the difficulty of the job of Services Australia in the process. It's not good enough. This country needs a government with vision. It needs a government that has a holistic jobs plan, that manufactures here in Australia and that embraces new opportunities and new jobs in renewables, waste and recycling, electric vehicles, our universities and vocational schools, and emerging industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the plan needs to be to increase JobSeeker beyond $40 a day. This is unacceptable, uncaring and stops people from effectively searching for work. We see ad hoc programs and bandaid solutions, but no underlying plan to carry Australia well beyond COVID. Labor, if elected, will deliver a plan for Services Australia that puts people first. It will make sure that this plan is compassionate and gets people back to rewarding, secure work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for government services has done well in presenting this motion to the House. This is an issue the shadow minister is passionate about and well versed in. I'd like to acknowledge his tireless advocacy on behalf of Australians, especially those employed by Services Australia. I take pride in standing with the shadow minister in saying thank you to those at Services Australia for their efforts, their calm under pressure and their compassion in helping Australia through one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. It's good to be back. Like many, I applaud the member for Maribyrnong for this motion he has moved in regard to Services Australia. The word I've noticed most this year has been 'pivot'. We have had to pivot and businesses have had to pivot. We and our own staff have had to be flexible and pivot in the way we do our jobs and understand what is happening within our communities. Services Australia also have had to pivot. They realised immediately that they had great responsibility thrust upon them. But it is not only Services Australia. The member for Maribyrnong, the Hon. Bill Shorten, said in his motion that this House:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… pays its deepest gratitude and thanks to all the women and men of Services Australia for their efforts in supporting their fellow Australians during this time of crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It surely was a time of crisis. I particularly note today that this crisis affected every department and every portfolio across the Public Service and, therefore, the Australians that they support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am keen to acknowledge this parliament's appreciation for the way that our public service, who are often maligned, have been praised in this case. They've been praised for good reason. Their job became harder within 24 hours. Their delivery services were tested to the limit. They had to pivot and change and develop and seek new ways and think outside the box, 'How can we deliver this service under these circumstances?' And they did it—each departmental secretary all the way down. Everybody had a responsibility. They understood their responsibility in this Great South Land, and they went out and they delivered on behalf of the Australian people to the point where the shadow minister Bill Shorten brought this motion before the parliament to give us a chance to say thank you—thank you not only to those in very senior positions whose faces we may have seen daily on our televisions but also to everybody else who gave up their time, made the effort and gave valued experience—I want to repeat that, 'gave valued experience'—doing the jobs that needed to be done on behalf of Australians. So, this was the point where 'we're all in this together' came together, because without the support of that public service, of Services Australia and every other portfolio and department, we wouldn't have been able to achieve the outcome we have in this nation. I applaud the Prime Minister and his team and the premiers and their team for what they have achieved, and they achieved it on our behalf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was blessed. Even though I lived in a COVID-lockdown zone, there were practically no cases in our area and we survived. In fact, the whole of my electorate of Monash was practically free of COVID for the whole time. But everybody took their responsibilities seriously. Everybody took steps. I don't know how embarrassed any of you have been when you've jumped out of the car without your mask and ended up standing in a shop where you think, 'Why is everybody looking at me?'—because we are able to get the message out through Services Australia. There were recalcitrant people; there always are. But basically—in Victoria especially—every family, every household everywhere, right across the state, country or city really stood up. You didn't mind if you were stuck in a line of cars 700 metres long and couldn't get through the roadblock and you couldn't get to your appointment, or if you couldn't get here and you couldn't do that, but we did pivot. We did things really innovatively. We did use the phone more often than we normally would. We probably saved the government a lot of money not having meeting after meeting after meeting. I'm grateful for this opportunity to thank Services Australia and all the public servants.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Maribyrnong for bringing this very important motion to the House. This year has no doubt been tough. So many people who have never been unemployed before suddenly found themselves in the queues at Services Australia, or Centrelink as we know it, applying for government help. When you have always had a job and never thought you would have to rely on the government for help, it is a really tough thing to do. It's a story I have heard over and over again. Not only that, many people had to navigate that system for the first time, creating a Customer Reference Number, or CRN, and getting registered in the system. It could be confusing and difficult, and it often needed guidance from a person on the other end of the phone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast, we saw more than 5,000 additional people accessing JobSeeker and youth allowance between December 2019 and June 2020. That was almost double the number of recipients receiving help due to the pandemic. But it didn't start with a pandemic. We had the added challenge of the bushfires, with more than 1,200 homes lost or severely damaged and many more people impacted financially. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From early on, I insisted that the government make the disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance available to those who had been impacted. Both of these payments are accessed through Centrelink. With everything our community has been through this year it can sometimes be easy to overlook essential workers, like those at Centrelink. These public servants come to work every day. They came through the bushfires, floods and the pandemic to make sure that others were getting the help they needed. They endured extremely difficult circumstances, with funding cuts and staffing cuts making their jobs more difficult than they should be. They listened to the harrowing stories of their friends and neighbours throughout the bushfires. They were not strangers in call centres overseas. They were locals who were also getting up every day to the smoke that permeated everything. Many had received evacuation orders and felt the stress and trauma we all did, not knowing where the fire would hit next. Their own homes and families had been under threat, but they came to work. They listened to people's stories. They helped them navigate the system and they made sure they were getting the help they needed. It was tough work. It was emotional and stressful, but they did it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then came the pandemic. There were lines out the doors, for hours, of people who—overnight—had lost their jobs. The government's online system couldn't hack it. It crashed from the surge of people going online to access the services. So, instead, people went into their local Centrelink office. It has been a really tough year for everyone across Australia. Our public servants in Centrelink were not immune to what was going on around them. They also did it very tough. I want to thank them for everything they did throughout these very trying times, for being there when we needed them most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is, this government has made the job for workers in Centrelink harder than it should be. There have been Public Service cuts and restrictive guidelines for disaster payments that haven't fit the reality of the situation on the ground. Robodebt is another clear example of where the government has utterly failed Centrelink workers. The list goes on. But there is another wave of challenges coming: when the government's planned cuts to JobSeeker come into effect and when the government's planned changes to JobKeeper force people back into unemployment queues once more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We simply cannot afford to see those crucial lifelines ripped away too soon. We need a permanent increase to JobSeeker. We need to see the coronavirus supplement extended further, so it can do its job in supporting the most vulnerable in our community. JobKeeper must keep going for as long as it is needed in the industries that need it. Again, I call on the government to not rip away these supports too soon. We are not out of the woods yet. While restrictions remain in place, local people, local workers, local small-business owners, will need this support. Ripping it away means that our workers in Centrelink will be forced to have increasingly difficult conversations with their neighbours. They'll be forced to turn desperate people away. They'll be forced to work longer hours and watch longer queues. It simply isn't fair on anyone.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on this private member's motion. I too acknowledge and thank everyone who works with Services Australia for all they've done for us, during this COVID pandemic, through their work with Medicare, Centrelink and child support payments. Being a frontline service provider in any service organisation is a really difficult job. It's a really difficult task. Being a frontline service provider in pandemic times—when more people than normal have lost their jobs, people are ill, people are scared—is even more difficult and more daunting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In normal times, the work done by Services Australia is huge. The figures from 2018 to 2019 show this. In 2018-19, Services Australia made payments totalling $184 billion. There were more than 3.5 million social security and welfare claims, more than 420 million Medicare services, more than 63,000 aged-care claims and around 980 million interactions with individual Australians. They are significant in and of themselves, but, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the work of the staff of Services Australia and the pressure on staff have increased dramatically. Services Australia has been at the forefront of the Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing support to millions of Australians. And, in an environment that is rapidly evolving due to both the health advice we've been given and the policy settings that we've had, they have had to adapt and change in a remarkably quick time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia centres have remained open throughout the entire pandemic. Since March, they have delivered more than $24 billion in additional payments and processed more than 1.8 million JobSeeker claims, providing income support to people in need. As at 13 November, $16 billion in coronavirus supplement has been paid to new and existing eligible income support recipients in addition to their usual payments. Around $9 billion has been paid to seven million lower income Australians, and over $16 million has been paid in pandemic leave disaster payments to almost 12,000 people across the various states. More than 300 items have been added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule in this time period, and over $2.54 billion has been paid for these items. At the peak of demand, there were almost 12,000 staff who were assisting the agency to manage its response to COVID. That sounds like a lot, but, when you put it in the context of what they did, it is actually extraordinary. This financial year, as at 6 November, the agency has processed close to 1.9 million social security claims—almost 70 per cent more claims processed when compared with the same period last financial year. As at 6 November 2020, the agency is processing the majority of social security and welfare claims in less than a week, so not only are they doing more but they are doing it quicker. The agency answered over 1.1 million more social security and welfare calls than in the previous financial year. They've upgraded the myGov capacity to support 300,000 concurrent users, up from approximately 90,000 concurrent users. They've gone from an average daily sign-in of 503,000 in 2018-19 to sign-ins of up to 741,000 in the full year 2019-20. The busiest day throughout this pandemic saw over four million sign-ins to myGov accounts compared to the previous record of 1.8 million logins during the July tax time peak period last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the statistics, but it's about the people behind the statistics who have gone to work every day. Sometimes they've faced abuse; sometimes they've faced a barrage of insults. They've had to deal with people who are crying in front of them, who are angry in front of them, or who don't actually know what they're doing. In my electorate of Curtin, four times as many people had to apply for JobSeeker than had ever done so before. These additional people had never been through the system before, so they had to navigate the system, and it was the service staff at Services Australia who helped them navigate. Yes, there have been some tensions at times, but I think everybody in Australia—even those who have experienced those tensions—could appreciate and understand why. To all the staff who have worked at Services Australia, I say a deep and sincere thankyou.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I acknowledge the member for Maribyrnong for bringing this motion to this chamber today. I think it's incredibly important. In my local community at the moment, a lot of my work is about acknowledging the work of essential workers as we work through the pandemic and finding people to celebrate and announce as Lalor heroes. What the member for Maribyrnong's motion does today is shine a light on those who work in government services. None of us in this chamber will ever forget the queues around our local Centrelink offices when this pandemic and the recession began. How could we ever forget? We saw person upon person, many of whom were standing in a queue in front of a Centrelink for the first time in their lives. I know I went down to our local Centrelink and spoke to people in those lines and spoke to the staff. I spoke to many people as they left after getting support from government services staff. I was astounded at the way they told me that they really appreciated the support that they had been given and the patience that they'd been seen with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working for government services during this pandemic has really shone a light on how important that work is and how important that public-facing aspect of this work is and how important it is for people, on potentially the worst day of their lives, to actually have a human being to speak to. Nothing is more important in times of heightened anxiety than person-to-person contact, and nothing is more important than those public-facing government service workers. They are the face of government on that person's worst day. We say that the pandemic is unprecedented, and we've heard it said a thousand times. But, although the queues were long, the feelings were similar to feelings during the bushfire crisis of last summer. I've spoken to local people who work in our Centrelink who volunteered to go and spend time in regional Victoria to support their neighbours and to support other people in Victoria as they sought support in recovery from the bushfires. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know how tough government service employees find their job. When I think about the days I spent sitting with members of the public from my community when they had received debt notices from the infamous robodebt system, I know how difficult that was for staff in my office and for me personally to sit with people who had been traumatised by a process, who were looking for assistance, looking for guidance and looking for help on what they perceived to be the worst day of their lives. I think about the people who work in government services and the people who work in Centrelink, and I think about the stresses of their day. When we ask people to be the public face of a government, then the least a government can do is make sure that, when people are seeking support, that public face is the face of a government who cares about the population—is the face of a government who is there to support Australians on their worst day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that is not how a lot of government services employees feel, and it's not a surprise. Our government services should be crisis ready all the time. That's what we've learnt this year. That's what we learnt in the bushfire crisis. That's what I learnt in my office during the height of robodebt: they need to be in crisis capacity at all times. They always need to have well-trained staff. Those staff need to be permanent and need to be secure in their employment so they can give the best service to people who need support on the ground. It is a fact that this government has not had that front of mind. This government closed the Newport Centrelink this year. They've sacked workers at Services Australia's call centre. They've refused to lift the staffing cap during this pandemic. They come into the House and give us all the numbers of the people who've been supported, but how often do those opposite sit with those workers to find out the toll on them of doing the work and how much better supported they would they feel if, in being the face of this government, they felt supported and were in secure work?</span>

It repeals two sections of the Family Law Act which provide the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. The perception in the community is that equal shared parental responsibility means equal time, but in law it doesn't. What the member for Moreton is doing in this private member's bill is taking away the misconception that parents will automatically get shared responsibility for and shared time with their children, because that is not the case. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were working in a world where the Family Court was operating at its maximum possibility, perhaps this wouldn't be such a big issue; but to leave that misconception in place when the Family Court, because of a lack of resources, is so overstretched that the delay in decisions is now up to four years—and during that time this misconception sits there, and people agree to parenting relationships which perhaps they otherwise wouldn't—is quite serious, particularly when you realise that so many of those relationships involve children who will be subject to violence and sexual abuse. We are talking about that today; we are talking about changing the law so that, when the court decides that equal shared responsibility will not be given, the court's decision is made entirely in the interests of the child. I can't stress enough the importance of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we have, in many ways, a number of conflicting priorities. Firstly, for me, if we were to start again with the world at the moment, we would want a world where men were far more involved in the raising of their children. We'd want a world not only where women could choose what they do with their lives, after fighting for it for quite a few decades, but where men had more flexibility to choose to stay at home. We would have a world where half the children of the world would be raised in those first years by men and half would be raised by women. Imagine how that would change the perceptions of men and women by our children, and the understandings of what they could do as adults. This would be quite a different world, and if I could create that world that's where I would go. Any policy that we work through—whether it's about work-life balance or industrial relations or family law—needs to keep at the forefront the need to increase the flexibility for both men and women to choose the relationships they have with their children and how they parent. We're nowhere near that yet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at this, it crosses my mind that we don't want to do anything in the family law world that might cause people to think that men aren't as entitled as women to have access to their children. I know there are many people out there who will automatically interpret this bill as doing that, but it does not. In conflict with that, we have this issue of the safety of children. No matter what we're talking about, we really have to put the children first—always and every one. The safety of the children absolutely comes first. Again, what this bill does is remove the misconception that equal shared parental responsibility in section 61DA means that children spend equal time with each parent, because that is not what it actually means. It also repeals a later section which provides that a court must consider, where an order is made for equal shared parental responsibility, the child spending equal time with each of the parents or substantial and significant time with each of the parents. I just want to make it clear here that, in law, when we talk about equal shared parental responsibility—I want to state it again—that does not mean equal shared time. It does not. You would all understand that, with the extended families we have now, with mixed families, with people living and working in different places, it's not always possible to deliver that anyway. So I support this small change to the Family Law Act. I do believe there's much more to be done, but it's a small yet significant step. </span>

                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' 13th and 14th scrutiny reports for 2020, which were presented out of session on 13 and 26 November respectively. The 13th and 14th scrutiny reports set out the committee's consideration of 29 new bills introduced into the parliament in October and November 2020 and 225 legislative instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislation between 21 September and 10 November 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the 13th report the committee sought information in relation to two new bills and concluded its report into six bills and one legislative instrument. Unfortunately, yet again, half of this previously nonpartisan committee has had to issue a dissenting report where the majority report has failed to properly fulfil its mandate of informing parliament as to the compatibility of Australian legislation with international human rights. This time, it was in relation to the committee's conclusion on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2020. This bill seeks to establish an extended supervision order scheme for high-risk terrorist offenders after they have completed their custodial sentence. It would enable a court to impose on a person any conditions, including potentially home detention, which it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities are reasonably necessary, appropriate and adapted for the purposes of protecting the community from the unacceptable risk of a person committing a terrorism offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dissenting members consider that this scheme fundamentally inverts basic assumptions of the criminal justice system and that persons should not be punished for a crime they may commit in the future. The dissenting members consider that, if the conditions imposed by a court are extensive, noting the balance of proof that applies, there is a significant risk that the scheme could impermissibly limit multiple human rights. The dissenting members consider it is important that the committee endeavour to provide genuine concluding advice to the parliament as to the compatibility of proposed legislation. This is particularly important where the legal advice to the committee indicates there are significant human rights concerns with respect to a proposed measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the committee's 14th report it sought further information in relation to three bills and five instruments, and made concluding comments in relation to four legislative instruments. For example, the committee sought further information about the Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020, which seeks to amend the Native Title Act 1993 to extend the operation of the future acts regime for another 10 years. This regime permits the construction of public housing and other infrastructure on Indigenous held land but without requiring the consent of native title holders and registered claimants. The committee considers that while the bill could promote the right to an adequate standard of living, education and health, facilitating the timely provision of public housing and other public infrastructure, it may also limit a number of other human rights—including the rights to self-determination, to culture, to equality and to nondiscrimination. As such, the committee is seeking further information regarding the proportionality of the measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I strongly encourage all parliamentarians to carefully consider the committee's analysis in these reports, including the dissenting report. With these comments I commend the committee's reports to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LEESER:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the committee I present this report. This inquiry was referred to the committee in June 2020. The terms of reference for this review directed the committee to provide both a general review of the Working Holiday Maker program and to consider the particular difficulties created by the shortage of working holiday-makers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee received more than 90 submissions and held 12 public hearings, with more than 30 hours of evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Working Holiday Maker program is a vital migration program for Australia. In recent years the program has attracted more than 200,000 young people annually from 44 different countries to travel and work in Australia. Australia remains the No. 1 destination for working holiday-makers globally. For 45 years the Working Holiday Maker program has enabled people to gain a deeper understanding and a more diverse experience of our country and its culture. The program also contributes to our international reputation by building advocates for Australia around the world. In exchange, the program provides similar opportunities for Australians to travel the world and bring their experiences and knowledge back to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working holiday-makers play a critical role in filling skills shortages across Australia, particularly in our horticulture and agriculture sectors, which continue to face the challenge of attracting Australians to fill these jobs. Working holiday-makers are uniquely suited to the seasonal nature of the jobs because they're flexible, they're a short-term workforce and they've got a desire to travel and experience work in our iconic farming businesses, which often struggle with labour shortages. The program plays a dual role in the tourism sector, where it attracts a large number of tourists who on average stay longer and spend more than other tourists. The program contributes $3.1 billion annually to Australia's economy and creates tourism jobs all over Australia, particularly in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic preventing the global movement of people, Australians have recognised just how valuable the Working Holiday Maker program is. In September the committee produced an interim report dealing with some of the challenges that had arisen from the pandemic-induced border closures. The committee has heard evidence about the urgent need to address the substantial labour shortages Australia's agriculture and horticulture sector is facing this harvest season.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's recommendations address these shortages, focusing on ways in which Australians, working holiday-makers and other visa holders could be incentivised to head to the regions to pick fruit. The government made announcements picking up many of the recommendations put forward in the interim report, including an investment of $33.7 million to support farmers by encouraging and incentivising young Australians to take a domestic gap year to work in the agriculture sector this harvest season. This includes a $16.3 million investment in temporary youth allowance and Abstudy eligibility changes to incentivise people to take up this work and $17.4 million for relocation allowances of up to $6,000 for Australians and $2,000 for other visa holders to undertake seasonal work in agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Working holiday-makers who have been unable to come to Australia or have had to leave Australia early due to COVID-19 are eligible for a visa application charge waiver when they decide to return to Australia, and a further $9 million has been invested to enable employers to access the Seasonal Worker Program and Pacific Labour Scheme to meet worker shortfalls. The government's measures help to ensure as much labour as is possible is directed to places where there is a critical need. Government measures incentivise Australians and visa holders to fill these workforce gaps that the pandemic has created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report builds on the findings of the interim report and calls for more to be done to promote opportunities right now in regional and remote Australia. While the interim report dealt with changes to the program dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, this report largely focuses on longer-term changes to the visa program. These include steps such as increasing the working holiday-maker age limits from 30 to 35 years and negotiating more bilateral working holiday-maker agreements with new countries, thus increasing the pool of available travellers. It also includes allowing working holiday-makers to work in tourism and hospitality in hard-to-staff rural and remote locations in order to satisfy the requirements for a second- and third-year visa; this was a point very strongly made to us by the tourism sector. The committee has also made a recommendation that will relax the requirement that working holiday-makers work with a single employer for no more than six months in hard-to-staff rural and remote areas of Australia. The report deals with other technical matters, such as asking the government to consider a tiered definition of 'regional', given the catch-all nature of the current definition. The report deals with other issues such as the need to implement the report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce and provide greater information and support to working holiday-makers. Also, in order to ensure that all available people are engaged in filling these critical labour shortages, the committee has recommended that the government consider incentives for a broader range of visa holders to undertake agricultural and horticultural work at this critical time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must deal with this matter immediately because David McBride must not be allowed to suffer for one minute longer. I remind the honourable members of the facts of this matter. David McBride is a specialist in international law. In 2009 he joined the ADF and served as a legal officer in the Special Operations Command. He was deployed to Afghanistan twice, in 2011 and, crucially, in 2013. Whilst serving in Afghanistan he became aware of a serious, systemic issue in our defence forces—in particular, the unlawful killing of civilians, unarmed adults and children. In 2014 he attempted to raise these issues with his superiors, including Major General Hurley, who is now the Governor-General, and was ignored. He then went to the Australian Federal Police and made a formal complaint, and that was ignored too. He then went to the minister and parliamentarians and was again ignored. When no real or effective action was taken, Mr McBride provided information to the ABC in 2016 which formed the basis for 'The Afghan Files'. He felt that he had no other option but to go public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David McBride has been charged with five offences for disclosing the information to the ABC, including theft of Commonwealth property, three counts of breaching the Defence Act, and the unauthorised disclosure of information. He now faces the prospect of 60 years in prison—effectively a life sentence. We need to suspend standing orders and to deal with this motion immediately because, as I've said, David McBride must not suffer one minute longer. We need to start treating whistleblowers in this country as heroes and not as villains. Not only should we urgently suspend standing orders and discuss this motion; just as urgently we should start talking about how we start celebrating, protecting and supporting our whistleblowers, because it's bigger than just David McBride. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Witness K and Bernard Collaery, two men also before a court for bravely bringing the public's attention, directly or indirectly, to the illegal intelligence operation conducted by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service when they bugged the East Timor parliament building in a shameless effort to give Australia an advantage in privileged joint treaty negotiations? What about Julian Assange, a man who bravely publicised hard evidence of US war crimes in Iraq? Who can forget the grainy black and white footage shot from a US attack helicopter gunning down Reuters journalists? Why does the government applaud the people who have spoken out in the Special Air Service Regiment for shining a light on alleged war crimes when at the same time it's so determined to have someone else shipped off to the US in a federal penitentiary for the rest of their life for publicising evidence of war crimes? There are others like Richard Boyle, the whistleblower from the Australian Taxation Office who has spoken out on account of misconduct within the ATO. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask honourable members to understand this: whistleblowers don't do it for themselves. They don't do it for reward. It's hard, but they do it because it's the right thing to do. All of these whistleblowers I've referred to—that's all they've tried to do. All David McBride has tried to do is to do the right thing. There's no fame, there's no money, there's no certificate on the wall. It's just the knowledge that they've done the right thing and they can sleep at night. In this country whistleblowers lose their job, they lose their friends, they lose their money and they often lose their lives. There's nothing in this for David McBride. So why is the government going after him when all he did, year after year, internally, with the AFP, with politicians, was to try to point out to anyone who would listen that there was wrongdoing going on in Afghanistan?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Deputy Speaker, we must suspend standing orders. We do need to debate this motion. We do need to call the government to account on this and to encourage the government, in the strongest possible terms, to drop the charges against one of Australia's great whistleblowers. David McBride tried to do the right thing; he exhausted all other options. The government can't say that he had avenues under the Public Interest Disclosure Act because the Public Interest Disclosure Act explicitly carves out national security issues. He had no whistleblower protection. He tried to do the right thing. He went to a number of people internally, he went to the AFP, he went to the minister, he alerted parliamentarians, and we all failed him. By suspending standing orders, by bringing this matter on and by having a debate to agree among ourselves that the charges should be dropped, finally we would bring some justice to this matter and finally we would do the right thing by a brave Australian whistleblower. I will leave it at that, because I want to leave time within this half hour for other members to speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is misreading the community badly on this. I hope at least the opposition and my crossbench colleagues will join me on this, because I think we speak for the community. We speak for a community that is outraged at the allegations, which were revealed in recent weeks, about the misconduct of special forces in Afghanistan. Yes, those soldiers should have their day in court for the charges to be brought against them and for them to defend themselves, but they're the only people that should be in court—not the whistleblower that shone a light on it in the first place. The soldiers who have been accused of misconduct should be in court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on it, let's not strip units of honours and awards that were earned overwhelmingly by good people fighting hard and heroically for this country. It is completely inappropriate to be talking of stripping a Meritorious Unit Citation on account of the misconduct of hopefully a very small group of people. Let's stop this sanctimonious hand-wringing about the misconduct that we've seen from a number of people in this place who then turn around and want to give a life sentence to the whistleblower who started the whole process of shining a light on the alleged atrocities in Afghanistan. I'll leave it there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to support this motion. If you won't support this motion, you'd better have a damn good explanation for it, because the community would be absolutely outraged if you didn't support this motion. I'll be on the barricades with the community, shining a light on the government's position on this, because it's rank hypocrisy. There's all this hand-wringing about these alleged atrocities by troopers, junior NCOs and senior NCOs in Afghanistan when at the same time you want to jail for life the man who did the right thing—David McBride. In my opinion, he's a hero. The charges should be dropped. He should be treated as a hero, not treated as a villain. That's what's required.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I second the motion to urgently suspend the standing orders. We must urgently debate this motion. This is critical. Former Senator Nick Xenophon, my former boss, gave me one piece of advice. He said, 'You must treat whistleblowers with great care,' and that's because in this nation we just don't. We have a culture in this nation in which we believe that whistleblowers should be persecuted, and that is fundamentally wrong. We do not have a legislative framework that protects whistleblowers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David McBride had been warning Defence about command failings and a deliberate blindness to the conduct of war in internal reports since 2014. He was a major in the Australian Army, a lawyer, in Afghanistan and awarded a combat services medal. When he became aware of systemic issues and when he became aware of incidents of unlawful killings of civilians, he took those concerns to his superiors, all the way up to Major General Hurley, and he was ignored. He did the right thing. McBride also reported them to the Australian Federal Police. He was ignored by their senior officers. McBride ultimately gave the material to the ABC, and that became the basis of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> story 'The Afghan Files'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that David McBride lost countless hours of sleep. I'm sure he still does, although he shouldn't any longer. He was arrested in 2017, with charges of numerous Commonwealth offences. He now faces the possibility of spending up to 60 years in prison all because he told the truth. We tell our children, 'Tell the truth.' Now the Australian Defence Force is taking action, but the damage has been done for McBride. Not only has he lost his career and not only has he endured so much stress and heartache; he now faces potentially spending the rest of his life in jail. The government could stop that, and they could stop that today. That's why we urgently need to debate this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's not alone. There is Witness K and his lawyer Bernard Collaery. It's hard to believe that the lawyer and witness with respect to Timor and Australia's wrongdoings—what we admit we did wrong in Timor—are both facing long sentences in jail. And there is ATO whistleblower Richard Boyle. Some of the charges against him were dropped, but he still faces a long, long list of charges. This is all because they were telling the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those whistleblowers and their courage redeem the reputation of our nation when they refuse to be intimidated into silence. By suspending the standing orders today we are recognising that time is of the essence, we are recognising that David McBride should not be facing a lifetime in jail. He should actually be thanked for his bravery. He should receive a medal; he shouldn't receive a jail cell. I again call on the government, I beseech the government: please drop the charges against this man. He has only told the truth. He has done nothing more. There's a saying, a very well-known saying that many of us would have read, 'The truth will set us free.' Well, not in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General, Minister for Industrial Relations and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  The government is not supporting this motion. I understand that the shadow defence minister wishes to speak as well, so I'll be brief. The issue is essentially procedural. I know that members have firm views on this and I respect their views, but this is an opportunity for the government to explain the procedural situation at law that it faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr McBride has been charged with one count of unlawfully disclosing information contrary to section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, three counts of unlawfully giving or obtaining information contrary to section 73A of the Defence Act 1903 and one count of theft contrary to section 13.1 of the Criminal Code. They are evidently serious charges. The prosecution was brought because the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions made an entirely independent decision that the prosecution was in accordance with the prosecution policy of that body.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, my consent as the Attorney-General was not required nor sought to institute proceedings of the offences that Mr McBride is alleged to have breached. The Attorney-General's consent to prosecute is required statutorily only in a very small subset of particularly sensitive offences across the statute books and is designed to ensure that the proposed prosecution in that very small group of offences is scrutinised at an additional level and a judgement is made about the appropriateness of the prosecution before they proceed. So, in response to calls for the government to intervene and discontinue this current proceeding, I can advise the House that the Attorney-General's power to discontinue prosecutions is reserved for very, very unusual and exceptional circumstances. A decision to intervene in this particular matter would most relevantly be made, if it were ever to be made, under section 8 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. During the passage of the DPP Act back in 1983, it was emphasised that the Attorney-General would normally play absolutely no part in the day-to-day decision making of the DPP. Any other course would defer a major purpose of the act, that being to distance central decisions around the prosecution process from the political arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Attorney-General was given that power to issue directions to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in 1983, it has never been used to direct the CDPP in relation to a particular case. I'm also advised historically that section 71(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903, which provides a broader ability to intervene, has also never been used since the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions' office has been established. I think, in large part, that is because such an intervention would be utterly extraordinary and would necessarily, by its very nature, represent political intervention in a process which has conventionally been independent. Indeed, if such intervention did occur, I have no doubt that this House would be rightly calling for explanations as to why the government was politically interfering in an independent prosecution process that has already run its course and been the subject of a decision by the CDPP. That process requires the CDPP to make decisions about the commencement of prosecutions independently of the government in line with its prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. Before a prosecution is commenced, the prosecution policy requires the CDPP to be absolutely satisfied that the prosecution would be in the public interest. For those reasons, the government does not consider it appropriate to intervene in this matter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also note, for the members who've made contributions today, that in addition to the criminal proceedings Mr McBride has also made an application under the Public Interest Disclosure Act, and that will be heard by the ACT Supreme Court. Both the criminal proceedings and the Public Interest Disclosure Act proceedings are before the court and they would not be the subject of appropriate comment, further, by me in my role as Attorney-General or by the government generally. But I do appreciate the contributions members have made and hope that sets out, in as clear as possible terms, what the procedural and legal issues are for the government in its determination not to support this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  With obvious reluctance I rise to indicate that the opposition will be opposing the suspension. The Brereton report has been shocking in its content and shocking for the nation. It has required much soul searching on the part of the Defence Force but also on behalf of our country. It needs to be dealt with with enormous sensitivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make two points at large. Firstly, without reference to anyone who was mentioned in this motion, the moral courage of those who stood up and called out wrongs that were committed amongst those they served with were acts of extreme bravery and we as a nation owe those people an enormous debt of gratitude. Secondly, when the Director of Public Prosecutions initiates a prosecution there is an obligation to satisfy the public interest test in terms of proceeding with that prosecution. There is an obligation to give an explanation for that, and it's very important that the explanation for why prosecutions occur is given to the Australian public. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make two points about this specific motion. Firstly, it has been Labor's position on the Brereton report and all that is contained within it that we as a nation ought to be making sure this is above the political fray. We ought to be making sure that people who are involved in this parliament are doing everything they can to support each other and the process of working through all that flows from the report's recommendations and, ultimately, the civil proceedings that flow from it. We want to hold true to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second, more specific point is that the action on this resolution calls for charges to be dropped. The Attorney-General has set out eloquently the essential proposition here. This flies in the face of the well-understood principle of the separation of powers between, on the one hand, the legislature and the executive and, on the other hand, judicial legal proceedings. Officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions have been established at a state and federal level precisely to give an arm's length ability or separation, in terms of the procedure in respect of criminal prosecutions, from the determinations that occur in the executive and the legislature branches of government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, politicians should have absolutely nothing to do with who gets prosecuted criminally in this country. That is a really important principle, and what is being proposed here flies in the face of it. Were we to get to a point where we were supporting this we would have crossed a huge threshold, which would be incredibly dangerous in what it allowed governments now and in the future to do. Governments should have nothing to do with the criminal prosecution of people in this country. That is for the Director of Public Prosecutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's on that basis that, notwithstanding the normal practice of supporting suspensions, we in the opposition and in Labor feel that there is no way we can be a part of a resolution that would seek to fly so flagrantly in the face of that separation of powers.</span>

We should at least have the debate in this place. People were rightly shocked by the revelations of war crimes, and I think the Australian population is generally supportive of a process to hold people who've committed wrongdoing to account. But I think people would also be shocked if they knew that the whistleblower who is the very reason that the whole process is happening is now being prosecuted himself and could find himself in jail. That would come as a shock to people. I take the points that have been made about interference in the prosecution process, but we've also got to confront the reality that we don't have proper protection for whistleblowers in this country. There needs to be stronger protection for whistleblowers, especially in this instance where the government has admitted that something went wrong in Afghanistan and has now put in place a process that could lead to prosecutions. Having admitted that something was wrong, why then oversee the prosecution of the whistleblower? Yes, we can have the debate about whether or not there are any instances in which it is appropriate for there to be an intervention and we should at least be allowed to have that debate. The power is there, and there's a good case to be made that this is the kind of exceptional circumstance that the power was inserted there for in the first place. We should at least be allowed to have the debate and ask the question: if the power is there for these rare interventions, then what is the threshold for that power ever being exercised if not now? Someone could be going to jail for blowing the whistle on what happened in Afghanistan when the government itself has admitted that things went wrong there. So it is incumbent on us to have a full debate here. That's why the standing orders should be suspended. It is incumbent on us today to have a full debate about that and for the government to clearly justify its position as to why it considers it is appropriate to oversee someone potentially going to jail for doing no more than blowing the whistle.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00APG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  While members are here, I have a short statement on some procedures in the House for this next fortnight. If members are able to stay that would be appreciated. As we begin this last fortnight, it's obviously been a challenging year for all concerned. The year's not over, but I do want to acknowledge the success that we've had here in the chamber so far in having a balance between the House continuing its essential democratic role and members maintaining their representative roles while still preserving, as best we can, the health and wellbeing of members and staff in the building. As you know, this has been supported by medical advice, for which I'm grateful, and I'm also grateful to all members for their contribution to this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By its very nature, the House has been an area of significant risk as members and staff gather from every corner of the country. The risk doesn't stay constant or just attached to Parliament House, of course. Members and their staff come together here during sittings and then return to their electorates right across the country. For many members, there have been sacrifices when they've needed to stay in their electorate during sittings or when they weren't able to be in the chamber at certain times, and I want to acknowledge that the chamber has only been able to continue its work because a significant number of members, at various times, have volunteered not to be here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As much as possible, the capacity of members to undertake their role has been accommodated, whether by constant revisions of the seating arrangements, which you're all very familiar with; by pairing which has been put in place; by the use of central lecterns on either side; and, more recently, from 24 August, by the ability to remote in by video facility. In this short period, the House has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the unusual circumstances without sacrificing either the integrity of its role and operations or the wellbeing of participants and their constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though we can be happy with the situation, we of course can't be complacent. We must maintain the balance between enabling members to fulfil their parliamentary roles as much and as normally as possible and acknowledging the health implications of coming together as representatives of 151 electorates. I know all members would agree that the Australian people would expect the House to set an example. The advice that we've received since the onset of COVID-19 is that the very nature of Parliament House creates a greater risk than elsewhere, and as such we must continue to be particularly cautious. We must ensure the integrity of the COVID-19 arrangements that we have in place to ensure the health and wellbeing of every occupant in the building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are just a couple of things to note with respect to this last sitting. You will note that with the seating we have the maximum number of seats here; it's the highest we've been since February. Those seats mean that we don't have the attendants sitting. That means that the attendants will still do their job; it'll take them a little longer to come from the attendants' stations. I should say the additional seats, as the tellers have just discovered, include three seats in the advisers' boxes on each side, so we've added that to the seating plan. So that means we've got the maximum in here. The other thing I would just add, of course, is that, with the seats that have been placed, a lot of work has gone into that, so if members can not move them—not try and be helpful and move them to accommodate other members—that would be appreciated. It would just save a lot of time, because they'll be moved back straightaway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's where we are, and I just wanted to update members on that. So the chamber will look a little bit different, particularly in question time today, with, as I said, the attendants coming and going but not here permanently. You can see all the seats around the back, which is the maximum number we can squeeze in. I thank the House. I just thought I'd update you on that now rather than at the start of question time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  Like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia—including Medicare, our world-leading superannuation system, the antidiscrimination law framework and the provision of free legal assistance services to Australians in need—the Family Court of Australia is a proud Labor legacy. Australians are used to the Liberal Party attacking and seeking to undermine these and other great social reforms introduced by Labor governments. Australians are used to the Liberal Party attacking Medicare. The Liberals never miss an opportunity to undermine the principle of universal health care in Australia, even as they now pretend to support it. Australians are used to the Liberal Party attacking superannuation, whether it's the Morrison government's recent policy to force struggling Australians to raid their retirement savings to make ends meet or the nasty and self-serving campaign by Liberal backbenchers to delay the increase to the superannuation guarantee. Australians are used to the Liberal Party attacking the legal assistance sector and the Commonwealth's antidiscrimination framework. Look no further than the Liberals' virulent but failed campaigns against Australia's longstanding protections against racist hate speech, as introduced by Labor and contained in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. And, yes, Australians are used to the Liberal Party neglecting, undermining and attacking the family law system in Australia, including the Family Court. When it comes to the great social reforms in Australian history, the Liberal Party is the party of wrecking. The Labor Party is the party of action and creation. And that brings me to the bills that are before the House today, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the associated bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court was established by the Family Law Act 1975. That act brought two major and complementary changes to our nation: it instituted no-fault divorce and it established the Family Court of Australia, a specialist, multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes. These were major reforms, and they were understood to be major reforms at the time. Before the Family Law Act, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 set out 14 grounds for the grant of a divorce. Those grounds included adultery, desertion, habitual drunkenness, imprisonment and insanity. To get a divorce, a spouse had to prove the other party was at fault. Private investigators did very well out of divorce law as it existed prior to the Family Law Act, but Australian men and, especially, Australian women did not. As Gough Whitlam said in the House of Representatives on 19 May 1975: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let us keep in mind that marriage is essentially a human relationship between 2 people. It takes 2 people to make a marriage but it takes only one to break it. Idealists might wish that it were otherwise, but it is not. It is time society acknowledged that simple fact. We have no right to condemn 2 people to live together in misery and suffering for a moment longer than necessary. Ultimately the only test of a marriage is whether both parties agree to maintain it. If one party is unwilling to maintain it the marriage has broken down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the commencement of the Family Law Act in January 1976, the only ground for divorce in Australia has been that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. This can be established if the parties have lived together separately and apart for a continuous period of 12 months. Spouses no longer have to go through the pain, expense and humiliation of trying to prove that the other person was at fault. In other words, the state no longer condemns two people to live together in misery and suffering for a moment longer than necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, the Morrison government is not proposing to reinstitute fault based divorce in Australia, but it is proposing to undo the second of the major changes introduced by the Family Law Act, which was the establishment of the Family Court of Australia as a specialist superior court. In 1974, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which had been tasked with reviewing the Family Law Bill 1974, said that the Family Court would be 'essential to give substance' to key aspects of the Family Law Act. Shortly after the passage of the Family Law Act, the then Labor Attorney-General Kep Enderby wrote this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In public discussion of the Family Law Act, most of the attention has understandably, and quite properly, focused on the ground of divorce and, to a lesser extent, the maintenance provisions. While not underrating the magnitude of the reforms to the divorce and maintenance laws, I feel sure that, in time, the provision for the establishment of Family Courts will come to be seen as a reform of equal importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kep Enderby was right: the Family Court of Australia is no ordinary court. Its essential distinguishing feature is that it only deals with family law matters. This bill would rob the Family Court of its essential distinguishing feature by collapsing it into one of Australia's busiest, most poorly resourced and overburdened courts: the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why specialisation is so important is that family law matters are not like other matters that generalist courts have to deal with, and the parties to family law matters are not like the parties that generalist courts tend to deal with. As Gough Whitlam said in 1974:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The essence of the Family Courts is that they will be helping courts. Judges will be specially and carefully selected for their suitability for the work of the court. There will be attached to the court a specialist staff, notably marriage counsellors and welfare officers, to assist the parties at any stage—and even independently of any proceedings. These courts will therefore be very different from the courts that presently exercise family law jurisdiction. The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that: Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. Parties will not be driven to the court by their own despair as a last resort; they will be encouraged to come to the welfare and counselling staff of the court whenever they have a matrimonial problem, even if they are not contemplating proceedings of any kind. This help would also be available after divorce proceedings, and this would, as I have already indicated, be of great importance where there were young children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If anything, the need for a specialist standalone family court is even more important than it was in 1974. As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted in its landmark 2019 report on the family law system, a report this government commissioned but has completely ignored, the Whitlam government could not have foreseen the growth in incidents and awareness of family violence and child abuse since 1975. The Whitlam government's vision of a specialist family law court was of a court with interrelated, co-located services and resources. It was not just about specialist judges; it was about creating an environment that would have regard to what Whitlam described as the 'human problems' of couples and families, including children, and not just their legal rights. The realisation of that vision has never been more important, especially for vulnerable children and families who need a family court system that is not only efficient but safe and sensitive to their needs and vulnerabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government's reckless proposal, what was once a superior court, sitting alongside the Federal Court of Australia in the national hierarchy, would effectively become a junior court, reflecting this coalition government's view about the importance of family law and its failure to prioritise the issues of family violence and child abuse that the Family Court of Australia and its staff have developed special expertise and jurisprudence to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not pretend, and nobody on this side of the House will pretend, that the Family Court of Australia in 2020 is fulfilling its original objective and Gough Whitlam's vision—far from it. The family law system today, including the Family Court, is in a state of crisis. The system is not serving the interests or addressing the needs of Australian families in the way that it should. Far from being the helping court that Whitlam envisioned, the Family Court—and the Federal Circuit Court for that matter—is beset by delays. The caring and hardworking judges of both courts are hopelessly overburdened by their caseloads because of the chronic underfunding of those courts by this government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which inquired into this bill, heard evidence that two Federal Circuit Court judges, one in the Brisbane registry and one in the Wollongong registry, had over 600 cases on their dockets. That is, over 600 cases for each of those judges at the same time. Three other Federal Circuit Court judges have between 500 and 600 cases, and 21 judges of the Federal Circuit Court have between 400 and 500 cases each. The average number of cases across all Federal Circuit Court judges is 337 at present. That's an average of 337 cases per judge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For contested family law matters in the Family Court, it is currently taking on average 18.6 months from the date a matter is filed to the date on which the trial commences. In the Federal Circuit Court, the average is 17.5 months, and that, of course, is just to get to trial. Once a trial has concluded, families are waiting many months for the courts to hand down their judgements, and that course is entirely understandable when you reflect again on the sheer number of cases that each of these judges has on their docket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some Federal Circuit Court and Family Court registries, it is taking on average 12 months for court appointed family consultants to produce family reports. That's the average amount of time it takes. Many, of course, are taking far longer. In a custody dispute, a family report is a critical document that provides an independent assessment of the issues in a case. Those reports help judges to make life-changing decisions about arrangements for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of delays are not mere statistics. In its landmark 2019 report on the family law system, which the government refuses to even respond to, the Australian Law Reform Commission referred to a number of concerns associated with present delays in the Family Court system, including the potential for children and parents to spend long periods living in limbo while waiting for the trial to commence; the safety risks to parties and children arising from delayed resolution of disputes that involve protective concerns, including contributing to homelessness; the scope for delay and uncertainty to exacerbate conflict; and the potential for people to consent to outcomes that fall short of the security and protection a court order could provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what will these bills do to address these and other problems in the family law system? The experts say that, at best, these bills will do nothing to alleviate any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system. But worse, the experts also tell us that the government's proposed merger will exacerbate many of those problems. This is because fundamentally this bill will cause harm to vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance by undermining the very principle of specialisation in the family law system. It is no small thing for two former Chief Justices of the Family Court to come out in opposition to a government bill. The very first Chief Justice of the Family Court, Elizabeth Evatt AC, has warned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Merging the Family Court into a generalist court will undermine the integrity and the structural specialisation of the Family Court. The impact of losing this institutional specialisation is not properly understood, and has been downplayed. The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions.  The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alastair Nicholson, who served as the second Chief Justice of the Family Court for 16 years between 1988 and 2004, has expressed disbelief about the government's proposal. It's worth quoting Alastair Nicholson's comments in full. I urge those opposite to take note of his remarks. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is unbelievable that Government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am firmly of the view that the passage of the Family Law Act 1975 … and the setting up of the Family Court was some of the most significant social legislation ever to be passed by the Federal Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What those proposing this merger do not seem to understand is that family law is complex and nuanced, and it is not to be judged by the output by numbers of cases as if the Courts are sausage machines. Throughput is important, but so is the quality of the decisions made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cases can be extremely complex and require specialist knowledge of the type that has always been available in the Family Court, which has provided leadership in the proper interpretation and principles to be applied by other courts with family law jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many involve the determination of important issues relating to children, including their rights and need for protection, not only from individuals, but also from government in its myriad forms. Many also involve problems of family violence and the effects of it upon the parties and their children. Others involve extremely complicated property disputes either alone or combined with the above issues and requiring other important specialist levels of legal knowledge, whilst understanding the important family issues that may be affected by the decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Court is a Court that has been envied throughout the common law world and its judgments have often been cited with approval by the courts of many countries including New Zealand, UK, Canada, the USA and others. Its significance as the only specialist Family Court set up as a superior Court of Record and particularly that of its Appeal Division cannot be over emphasised.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just former chief justices who are opposed to this proposal; over 110 family law experts, including the Law Council of Australia, Women's Legal Services, community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates and disability services from across Australia, have called on the government to abandon it. The Morrison government has arrogantly and disgracefully ignored all of them. In his smug arrogance, the Attorney-General has dismissed concerns with a wave of the hand because, apparently, he knows best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would expect that a proposal as radical as this one would be based on sound evidence and would have only been put forward by a government following a lengthy and detailed consultation process, but that is not what has happened. As alluded to by Alastair Nicholson in his remarks, neither the Attorney-General nor his department undertook any meaningful consultation in relation to these bills—no consultation with the legal profession or with other family specialists like counsellors or child psychologists; no consultation with the users of the Australian family law system, Australian families; and no consultation with the judges of the Family Court, other than with the current Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia. This Attorney-General thinks he knows more about the needs of Australian families than the people who work with and for those families every day. This Attorney-General thinks he knows more about the needs of Australian families than Australian families themselves, none of whom were consulted in the development of this legislation. The arrogance of this government is breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is the government doing this? What is its justification? As I hope everyone in this House knows and as I have noted already today, there are currently two Commonwealth courts that hear family law matters: the specialist Family Court of Australia and the non-specialist Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The Morrison government's central justification for these bills is that merging the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court will reduce delays and backlogs, by creating a single point of entry for federal family law matters and by ensuring the development of common rules of court, forms, practices and procedures. Like so much else with this government, this justification does not withstand even the slightest degree of scrutiny. It is essentially a marketing stunt intended to make this government look like they're acting on a problem rather than a sound policy to actually respond to the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of a single point of entry and the development of common rules, forms, practices and procedures across the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court is widely supported, and all of these things can be and are being achieved without these bills. You do not have to take Labor's word for it; the Chief Justice of the Family Court told a Senate committee last year that all of these changes can be achieved without any legislative amendments at all, and in fact all of those changes are in the process of being implemented by the courts right now without any legislative change. In short, the justification for this merger proposal does not stack up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what evidence is the government relying on? What is this proposal based on? I've already explained that the government engaged in virtually no consultation before introducing these bills, but the government still claims that these reforms are based on evidence. In fact the Morrison government claims that the proposed merger has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. The Attorney-General's Department has listed five reports under the heading 'The evidence base for the reforms' on its website. I can only assume that the government is hoping that nobody actually opens any of these reports, because if they did they would see that none of the reports listed on the government's website recommended these radical reforms. None of those reports even considered these reforms. In fact, the only one of the five reports that made any recommendation about restructuring the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court recommended an entirely different model which would have maintained a standalone specialist family law court—in other words, a model that would be consistent with the principle of specialisation rather than a model which would completely undermine it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only report that even comes close to recommending the abolition of a standalone specialist Family Court is a six-week desktop review of operational data by two accountants—and that is the report that the government is actually relying on. That is the report that the Attorney-General cites every time he is asked about this merger. I am not making that up. By the Attorney-General's own admission this entire proposal is based principally on the findings of a desktop review by two accountants—a review, by the way, that has been widely panned and thoroughly discredited, not least of all because the two accountants made a series of heroic assumptions, including that there was an equivalent level of complexity between the matters being heard in the Family Court and the matters being heard in the Federal Circuit Court. That is patently a ridiculous assumption to make, and it undermines the findings of the report, which, unsurprisingly, were that the Family Court was less efficient at dealing with matters than the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite the findings of the two accountants' desktop review being based on obvious and fundamental errors, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are now proceeding with radical changes to our court system based on the same erroneous assumptions. It seems astonishing that any government could behave in such a destructive and arrogant manner in ignoring all evidence and pressing ahead regardless of the harm they are told their policies will cause, but this is the same Attorney-General and the same Prime Minister who designed and then gave our nation the economic, political and human catastrophe that was robodebt—so maybe we shouldn't be surprised. Australian families deserve so much better than this. Australian children deserve so much better than this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the creation of a single point of entry and the development of common rules, forms and procedures are positive changes—and, to repeat, those changes are happening now without these bills—those changes will not address the main problem with the family law system, and that problem is no mystery. As the Australian Law Reform Commission found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last seven years in particular, the story of the Australian family law system has been a story of neglect, neglect and more neglect—neglect by the Liberal government led by Tony Abbott, neglect by the Liberal government led by Malcolm Turnbull and neglect by the current Liberal government led by Scott Morrison. Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges have not been replaced in a timely manner, funding has not increased and review after review—including many dozens of sensible and measured recommendations—continue to be ignored. As I speak to you today, the Australian Law Reform Commission's landmark report into the family law system is gathering dust in the Attorney-General's office and the findings and recommendations of many other reports continue to be ignored. The government's record on the family law system is a disgrace. But instead of contrition, we get arrogance; instead of fixing the problems, we get this dangerous and misconceived proposal. All of this from a party that likes to pretend that it is the party of family values.</span>

The House spent 28 sitting hours debating that bill. There was disagreement, there was debate, but across the political spectrum members of this House took the reforms seriously and the legislation that that debate produced has served Australia well. Australian families deserved no less then, and they deserve no less today. Yet how many people on the other side of the House are going to speak on these bills today?

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the associated bill. The member for Isaacs, who just spoke, is somewhat confused. On the one hand he says that the Family Law Act has served Australia well, but a few short sentences prior to that he was saying that no-one on that side of the chamber would accept that the Family Law Act has continued to benefit Australians in recent times. I'm the chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, and we're conducting an inquiry at the moment in relation to domestic and family violence. The terms of reference of that inquiry have been carefully crafted to try and avoid hearing evidence in relation to the many problems that are experienced by users of the family law system, simply because there is a specific inquiry that is currently under way at the moment with Kevin Andrews in the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System, which is specifically dealing with problems with the Family Law Act. I understand that that inquiry report is due to be handed down in February next year, as is the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee report into domestic and family violence. One of the common themes that the inquiry has heard consistently is that the family law system is broken. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How the member for Isaacs could stand up and say that the Family Law Act has served Australians well is beyond me. I don't want to join in some sort of politicisation of this issue, because this issue is so very important to the welfare of Australians. As a barrister, I'll put my hand up and say I consciously did not choose to practice in this area of law. Certainly my peripheral experience has been reflected in what I have heard during the inquiry I am undertaking at the moment: many harrowing stories of domestic violence that have been told to the committee often stem back to what users have said is a hopelessly broken and protracted family law system. That is not just being said by one or two people; this is consistent across the evidence of many peak bodies and individual users who have either been through the system or are currently going through the system right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They say that the ultimate form of insanity is to keep doing what you have been doing and expecting a different result. Things had to change, and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 will go a considerable way to improving the way that family law and marriage break-ups will be dealt with in this country. The Morrison government is committed to ending unnecessary costs and delay for thousands of Australian families that arise from a split federal and family court system and to a new system that provides safe pathways for separating families. I don't think anybody in this chamber would dispute that that is a worthy goal, that families who are undertaking a marriage dissolution should get the best system possible at a time which is probably the worst time of their lives. The longer this system is protracted and the longer that families are forced to go through a system which is broken, the greater risk there is for domestic and family violence. Does anyone on the other side of this chamber quibble with that statement? The longer that families have to endure a broken family law system, the greater the prospect, however terrible that is, that women will be subjected to domestic and family violence. That is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Structural reform of the federal family law courts will ensure that families are able to have their matters dealt with as efficiently as possible. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 brings together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as an overarching, unified administrative structure to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The Family Court will continue in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court Division 1. I will refer to that as Division 1 from here on. The Federal Circuit Court will continue in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court Division 2, and from here on I'll refer to that as Division 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates a consistent pathway for Australian families to have their family law disputes dealt with in the federal courts. Under the government's reform, there will be a single point of entry for the federal family law jurisdiction and, ultimately, a common set of rules, practices and procedures and approach to case management. The reforms enabled by these bills will improve the user experience for those Australian families that, unfortunately, need the assistance of the courts to resolve their disputes, and they will promote improved practices by both courts and legal practitioners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Division 1 would be conferred original jurisdiction in family law and child support proceedings only where matters were transferred to it from Division 2 as part of the single-point-of-entry model. Matters will be filed in Division 2 in the first instance and transferred to Division 1 as required, consistent with the courts' case management processes. This will reduce confusion for families about where to file and will reduce unnecessary transfers of matters between Division 1 and Division 2. It will improve the user experience of the family law court system considerably.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The court would retain the same appellate jurisdiction as the Family Court; however, more appeals will be heard by a single judge. Through enabling a presumption of single-judge appeals from decisions of Division 2, judges of Division 1 would be more available to hear more first-instance matters, giving families a quicker resolution to their matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overarching purpose of the new family law case management provisions is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law and as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. Everyone in the family law system must conduct proceedings consistently with this overarching purpose. The transfer provisions, in combination with the case management provisions, would ensure matters are in the most appropriate court as early as possible and with as little interruption as possible. Division 2 would retain the same original jurisdiction as the Federal Circuit Court and be extended to include family law and child support matters over which the Family Court currently has exclusive jurisdiction. This would be a key component of the single-point-of-entry model for first-instance family law and child support proceedings. Family law judicial appointments will have to include consideration of the person's knowledge, experience, skills and aptitude relevant to hearing family law cases, including cases involving family violence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation does not get rid of the specialist court. It enshrines a minimum of 25 judges in accordance with the Semple report. The Family Court is not the only court with specialist judges. The Federal Circuit Court currently has 40 full-time specialist judges who do nothing other than sit on family law matters—the largest division of specialist family law judges in this country. Those judges have an average of 25 years experience, and the Federal Circuit Court currently does 88 per cent of all family law cases and 90 per cent of all parenting matters, including complex matters. Overall, a total of 50 full-time-equivalent judges do 17,000 daily law cases, with a lower appeal rate per judge than the specialist Family Court of Australia judges—25 of whom do only 3,000 cases, with substantial assistance from registrars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court of Australia is now made up of many Federal Circuit Court judges, including a number in the appeal division. The reality is that not all Family Court of Australia judges came from family law practice. This makes it false that specialist family law judges sit in the family law court. A number were judges in district courts, working on crime, or they were silks working on crime. They were specialists in commercial or insolvency law. At least 25 per cent, if not more, of Family Court judges didn't come from a specialist background of family law, and practised in many other areas and many other jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not abolish the Family Court. The government has never suggested that this is the only family law reform to be pursued, and that is evidenced by the ongoing investment and action taken by the government to support the family law system. In the October 2020-21 budget, the government announced funding for the family law system, including funding of $87.3 million for family law services; funding of $12.8 million for an additional family law judge, five additional family law registrars and increased base funding for the Federal Circuit Court; funding of $2½ million for the federal family law courts to continue operating specialist COVID-19 lists; additional funding of $4.8 million for the Family Violence and Cross-Examination of Parties Scheme; the relocation of family law court registries in Rockhampton and Launceston to safer and more secure premises, at a cost of $7.7 million; funding of $1.8 million to implement the federal family violence orders; and a new case management system for the Family Court of Western Australia, at a cost of $2½ million. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament has recently passed legislation to support the implementation of a new family safety risk-screening and triage process that will be piloted in the family law courts with a $13½ million government investment. The pilot, known as the Lighthouse Project, is about to begin operations in Brisbane, Parramatta and Adelaide. It will pilot a systematic approach to identifying and managing family safety by systematically screening all new parenting matters for family safety risks when filed in the court. Matters will be triaged according to the level of identified risk, and the Federal Circuit Court will operate specialist family violence lists to resolve high-risk matters faster and safely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, the government funded the Federal Circuit Court, the Family Court and the Family Court of Western Australia to engage more family consultants. Family consultants are qualified social workers and psychologists who specialise in child and family issues after separation or divorce. More broadly, the government provided $340 million in funding as part of the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, as well as a further $150 million in its COVID-19 domestic violence support package to respond to the impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable Australians. From 1 July 2020, the National Legal Assistance Partnership increased funding for frontline legal services, taking Commonwealth funding to more than $2 billion over five years to legal aid commissions, community legal centres and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services. This bill represents sensible, pragmatic reform to a system that is broken, and I commend it to the House.</span>

He may not know that, prior to that legislation, there was no no-fault divorce. Not only did one partner or the other have to take the blame for the failure of the marriage—and, as the Prime Minister at the time said, it only takes one partner in a marriage for a marriage to fail—but photographers were storming into people's bedrooms to catch them in compromising situations. So there is nothing inconsistent in the shadow Attorney-General saying that this legislation has served us well and that, currently, it is broken. This legislation by the Morrison government will not fix that. </span>

I rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to Greenway's Sikh community and indeed Sikhs everywhere on the 551st anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. I have always been inspired by the teachings of Guru Nanak. He taught that the value of a person is determined not by an innate characteristic or label but by the goodness of their heart and the depth of their character. He called Sikhs to service and charity and emphasised love and respect as central to a long and prosperous life.</span>

I have experienced the generosity and warmth of the Sikh community on countless occasions, including over the weekend when I visited the Glenwood gurdwara and representatives of the Australian Sikh Association. It has been a challenging time for faith communities, but I was very pleased to return to the gurdwara after a long absence due to the pandemic, and I congratulate all those involved in helping to make it a COVID-safe environment. They have adapted and people are coming back, which is great to see.</span>

It continues to feed people who are less fortunate or homeless in the Blacktown area and has been working tirelessly to provide staple food hampers to locals throughout the pandemic, and I note that they provide this service outside the pandemic as well. I congratulate them on this momentous occasion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to visit the Costa berry farm at Dunorlan, just outside Deloraine in the north-west of my electorate. I would like to thank the regional manager, Cameron Folder, for showing me around the farm and sharing his passion for the industry. We were joined by Andrew Terry from Tas Berries, another local from a well-known farming family with deep roots in the region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks in part to irrigation innovations that started under Labor governments, Tasmania's berry industry is booming. It's now worth almost $200 million to our state economy and employs almost 6,000 people during harvesting season, and Costa is a huge part of this wonderful success story. I was particularly interested to hear about Costa's plans to trial the use of bumblebees to increase production. The government has previously committed to amending the EPBC Act, which is necessary to allow this trial in Tasmania to proceed. But we have come to learn that with the Liberals an announcement does not mean a delivery. I do support this trial, and I encourage the government to get off its backside and get buzzing. We need this trial to go forward, because agriculture needs the innovation. Agriculture in Tasmania cannot afford these unnecessary hold-ups, particularly now with so much uncertainty. The government should make good on its promise to get this trial up and running.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  On 1 November, one of my constituents, Mrs Rita Greiner of Arcare Malvern East, celebrated her 100th birthday. As part of the celebrations, her family shared some of Rita's stories of her life of enduring community service. Rita was born in Mogilno, Germany, in 1920, and by 1939, with war looming and in order to escape Nazi persecution, her parents had decided to send Rita to live in Australia. Tragically, she never saw her parents or sisters again. Her first job arriving in Australia was as a nanny to two young children, before training to be a nurse, acquiring certificates in nursing, midwifery, infant welfare and obstetrics. In 1946, Rita travelled to Higgins, where she met her future husband. Together they raised three beautiful children, including twins. As well as working at the local Caulfield Hospital and raising children, Rita always found time to visit people in their homes so she could provide them with support and companionship. But it is her service to Emmy Monash Aged Care that has been an enduring passion. Her time there has spanned a remarkable 50 years, initially as a visiting nurse, before helping to distribute morning tea in order to raise funds for much-needed lifestyle equipment. Rita's long life has been dedicated to community service, and she's a role model to us all. I think we can all agree when Rita says there is no other country like Australia. Happy 100th birthday, Rita. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  It takes an ecosystem to build a cyber-resilient nation. Our national security agencies alone aren't enough to defend Australia from cyberattacks. A healthy ecosystem relies on cross-pollination from the innovation and insights of a thriving specialist private-sector security company. As the release of today's cybersecurity competitiveness report from AustCyber highlights, this is an opportunity as well as a challenge for Australia. Australia's specialist cybersecurity companies are not only a crucial part of Australia's own cyberdefences; they can also be a world-beating, job-creating export industry if the government backs the sector. Today's AustCyber report shows a sector at a crossroads. There is an opportunity for the sector to more than double its contribution to the economy, to $7.6 billion by 2024, and add 7,000 new jobs, for a total workforce of 33,500—desperately needed jobs during an economic crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But to do this the industry needs a government that will back it, and, unfortunately, there were no industry development policies or even objectives in the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy. There was no vision for the economic opportunities. The Morrison government is only interested in cybersecurity for prime ministerial national security photo ops. As former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Since I left, there isn't, at a senior level, anyone taking an interest in cybersecurity … I don't think Scott Morrison is particularly interested in it, or familiar with it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend, we saw a media drop that said the Prime Minister was planning to promote the cybersecurity portfolio into the cabinet.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  In my electorate of Menzies, especially the areas of Warrandyte and Wonga Park, Park Orchards, Eltham and Kangaroo Ground, the risk of fire is real, and that's why it's important that people have in place a plan for the coming fire season. Not everyone thinks clearly in an emergency. Taking steps to get prepared before the fire season means you know what to do when there's a risk of fire. A written and preferably well-practised plan will help you remember what needs to be done during a crisis. The Country Fire Authority has a bushfire survival planning template on its website, and I commend it to all my constituents and others in bushfire-prone areas. This year more than others, it's also necessary to take account of any particular requirements because of the COVID-19 virus. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leaving home early is the safest option for people to protect themselves and their families. That means leaving before there are signs of fire, not when there's flame and smoke all around. The template from the CFA addresses questions like: which fire danger rating is your trigger to leave? Will you leave early in the morning or late the night before? Where will you go? What route will you take? Is there an alternative route if that route is cut off? What will you take with you? Do you need to organise for pets or livestock? Who do you need to keep informed about your movements? Is there someone else outside your household who also needs assistance? I commend the CFA website to all my constituents. </span>

Gordon was a giant in Bendigo—a successful businessman and a community leader. He was described in this place as a living treasure, and that he was. He received the Medal of the Order of Australia for outstanding service to the community. Gordon was somebody you could always chat to about the future and the vision for Bendigo and, until the very end, was a strong advocate for reform in our area. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was awarded Eagle Hawk Citizen of the Year and Bendigo Citizen of the Year. He was a passionate advocate for the arts, being the first and former chair of the Ulumbarra Foundation, the former chair of the Bendigo Art Gallery and the first and former chair of the Aspire Foundation. He also served in local government. He was the first chief commissioner of the Mitchell Shire Council as well as being involved in what later became the City of Greater Bendigo. </span>

To this day, I don't know whether he voted for our side or the other side, because he came from a time when you didn't discuss such things. He will be missed. He was a big part of the heart of Bendigo, and I know that his family will miss him deeply. He was a loving grandfather of 18 children and a great-grandfather to 19, all of whom we are thinking of today. Thank you, Gordon, for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Today I'm thrilled to speak on a wonderful community leader who has aptly been described as the heart and soul of the northern suburbs community. Denise Delphin OAM, you are an absolute gem. After 37 years devoted to creating a stronger connected and empowered community, Denise will be retiring from her role at the Northern Suburbs Community Centre. Starting off as a volunteer at the local Neighbourhood House in 1983, Denise became a committee member and coordinator before becoming community centre manager and coordinator in 1999. Two years ago, Denise took on the role of general manager. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've come to know Denise as she's been known to the community: a tireless, dedicated and inspirational leader who has left a wonderful legacy. A colleague described Denise as the mother of the northern suburbs. Denise's work received high recognition last year when she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Through the flourishing community gardens to Men's Sheds, partnerships with Health Tasmania and, the most recent, Adventure Play, to name a few, the local community has had access to a number of health and wellbeing programs that have made a demonstrable difference to those who've utilised the services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delivery of these programs would not have been possible without the tireless work of Denise and the incredible team she has built around her. Denise, you will be sadly and sorely missed, but I, along with your beloved community, wish you all the best for what lies ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Let's be clear: a pandemic shutdown is not an emissions reduction plan. I certainly welcome that emissions are down, but let's get real. The heavy lifting is being done by the private sector and state governments who are announcing ambitious and strong plans for emissions reduction—in the absence of any such move by the Commonwealth government. The Morrison government is trying to take credit for the work it hasn't done. The reality is that emissions have only reduced by a little over nine per cent in the last seven years, and just over six per cent of that has happened this year under COVID shutdown. Meanwhile, with a climate change act firmly in place for over 10 years now, the UK is on track to deliver a 61 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is the Morrison government to come on board, legislate net zero by 2050 and put in effective plans to get there. The Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) Bill 2020 will do just that and is before the parliament. The House Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy is currently holding an inquiry into the bill, and submissions are pouring in, and it's an impressive and expansive list of businesses and organisations that are supporting this legislation. I call on the government to be involved, be ambitious and be brave to meet this challenge. Legislate net zero by 2050 and implement a clear plan to get there. </span>

The Surfers Paradise Baseball Club have upgraded their batting cages and safety equipment. They received a Stronger Communities grant of $5,454 and a volunteer grant of $1,350. Benowa State High School is improving sun safety for their students with a Local Schools Community Fund grant of $5,000 which they've used to purchase new covered outdoor seating for students to enjoy during breaks. The Southport Soccer Club has upgraded change room facilities thanks to a $5,000 Stronger Communities grant.

Bright and as excited as always, students at St Mark's had the opportunity not only to hear how the government works but also to ask tough questions of their local federal member. St Mark's is a vibrant learning community within the St Mark's parish that is founded on the values of respect, relationships and responsibilities. They gave me a squeezy stress ball—which has had great use!—with that slogan on it. The Oxley electorate Parliamentary School Program allows me to outreach about all of the government's services and inspire young Australians who may one day be leaders sitting in this place. I take a moment to thank members of our local Forest Lake Men's Shed who created a replica dispatch box and mace to help teach students about the history and processes in parliament.</span>

I believe it's important that, as leaders, we connect with the next generation of our community as they learn and navigate their way through learning. We are proud of all of our educators and we salute you all.</span>

Tony arrived in Australia from Italy in 1962 and has always remembered how friendly and welcoming the locals were. Since retiring from work at the Berwick Potteries in 2007, Tony has dedicated himself to working for the betterment of the Bunyip community. He served on most of the committees in the town as well as having been foundation director of the Bunyip community bank, and serving 13 years as a member of the Bunyip Fire Brigade and 20 years as a volunteer and board member of Hillview Bunyip Aged Care.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony's other passion was to establish a soccer club once he retired. In 2008, he set up the Bunyip soccer club, which started off as a rough patch of dirt. Today, things are different, with the club about to officially open its new $3 million state-of-the-art pavilion. Tony served the Strikers for seven years as president and he was very fortunate to have the assistance of his wife, Carmelina; Roman Kulkewycz as secretary; and Alan Cole as treasurer in the club's formative years. Within two years, the Strikers were playing in the prestigious Football Federation Victoria competition. The club honoured Tony with a life membership in 2018.</span>

He's always ready to help. Tony said he was humbled and very surprised to receive the OAM. Tony always wanted to give something back to the community in acknowledgement of the kindness shown him in 1962, and he's done so in spades. I seek leave to table the full statement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  The vulnerability of my community to power failure and lack of communications was highlighted yet again this weekend. As the first bushfire of the season in the Blue Mountains at Faulconbridge was whipped up by strong winds with temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s, power went down, and that means, for anyone on NBN, the phones died. For many of us, that means no mobiles either, because we don't have mobile coverage and rely on our modems to link us to the network with wi-fi. Once power was restored, Facebook told the story of anxious hours without good access to communication. In Faulconbridge, residents who can usually access an Optus signal reported that it had been down. In Winmalee, a resident with Telstra mobile lost reception. She could get the occasional Facebook message but couldn't load Fires Near Me for updates. In St Albans, the landlines themselves failed. Telstra failed on top of everything else. Residents are resorting to recommending satellite phones for people living in urban areas. It's ridiculous and happening right across the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />These are the ongoing problems that the Morrison government turns a blind eye to. In its half-baked approach to black-spot funding, this government was happy to take away a proposed mobile phone tower for Mount Tomah. It leaves telcos to be responsible and takes no responsibility for the gaps. It's time there was a complete review of phone and mobile coverage for bushfire areas and that this problem was fixed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Thirty kilometres off the coast of Mackay there's an island which could offer a lifestyle that many people dream about, but the dream has turned into a nightmare for the 40 or so residents who have sunk their lifesavings into their own homes or holiday homes. About 18 months ago, the Queensland Labor government handed over the long-term lease of the island to a Chinese based company called China Bloom. Their development arm is great on developments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Keswick Island we're talking about. The new Chinese landlords are making life very difficult, even impossible. Residents who access Keswick Island by private planes are barred, as are all commercial flights. An approved helicopter trip will cost about $1,500—it's actually cheaper to fly to Bali. The public boat ramp has also been closed to residents. Beautiful bays on the island now sport signs barring entry. A group of residents are fighting for access, but their pleas to the Palaszczuk Labor government are falling on deaf fears. As one of the residents so bluntly put it: 'The property values have gone from millions to nothing as no bank, in or out of the country, will touch property on the island, and who would want to buy or live here with the culture and belligerence and bullying that is going on.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Queensland Labor to act now to correct these terrible injustices. Keswick Island is Queensland. Keswick Island is Australia. Keswick Island is not communist China. Australians should have free and fair access to their own properties on Keswick Island.</span>

A full-scale humanitarian crisis has been unfolding in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where I believe 50 Australian citizens are presently located. The situation there remains grave. For some time now, communications have been cut off in Tigray, resulting in Australians being unable to contact families and loved ones. It's almost impossible to imagine how distressing this must be, given the circumstances there at the moment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While other nations have repatriated their citizens from this conflict, we have not. The UN is preparing for 200,000 refugees to flee. Amnesty International has documented a massacre in which scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death. The world cannot stand by and watch, and neither can we. I urge all parties to protect the civilians, to respect human rights and to allow access to humanitarian agencies. I urge all of us in this place to do all we can to support our friends in Australia's Ethiopian community, at what is a tremendously difficult, indeed, awful, time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  This month I attended a fundraising dinner in support of the establishment of a Korean war memorial in Perth. The fact that there is not yet a Korean war memorial in Perth is a good example of why this war is often called 'the Forgotten War'. I think we can all agree, especially the families of the 17,000 Australians who fought in Korea, including the 340 who were killed, that no war should be forgotten.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Korean military forces crossed the border into South Korea on 25 June 1950. The UN Security Council denounced the North Korean invasion and authorised the dispatch of forces to Korea. Twenty-one countries, including Australia, contributed to the UN force. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The Korean War was amongst the most destructive in our modern era with a larger proportional civilian death toll than either World War II or the Vietnam War.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the Perth Korean War Memorial Committee for helping us honour the service and sacrifice of Australians who fought in Korea. I especially commend the honorary consul for the Republic of Korea in WA, Fay Duda, committee member Peter Heeney and the head fundraiser, James Rhee. Thank you also to Tjorn Sibma MLC and Senator Dean Smith for their support for this important project. The launch of the memorial is planned to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice on 27 July 2023.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I present this certified petition at the request of an organisation based in my electorate, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants League of Queensland. This group, based in West End, has gathered 1,238 signatures from people who argue that the current single age pension is not enough to cover the basic cost of living. They are arguing for a reduction in the difference between the couple age pension and the single age pension, from 33 per cent to 18 per cent. Pensioners and their families, not just in my electorate but across the country, know the Morrison government cannot be trusted with their pensions or their standard of living after retirement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a long track record of cutting or attempting to cut the pension, and just recently, in the middle of a recession, the Morrison government froze the pension for 2.5 million pensioners. The government were caught out by Labor, which is the only reason they acted on it. They still haven't adjusted deeming rates, which still remain significantly higher than interest rates, meaning pensioners are being short-changed every day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now pensioners and other payment recipients are concerned they will be forced onto the cashless debit card. The government is ideologically obsessed with this card and determined to expand it, no matter what. Pensioners have paid their taxes and contributed to the economy their entire lives. They deserve our respect. People in my electorate understand this. Why doesn't the Morrison government?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The petition of Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' League (QLD) Inc and citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House that the current single aged pension is not enough to cover basic living needs as the current aged couple pension is $1407. As at the 20th of September 2019 when a person is widowed this reduced to $933.40 a reduction when support is most needed. Difference between coupled and widowed pension is $473.60. This has not been reviewed for a long time and we believe the difference should be 18% between the two pensions not 33%. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We the undersigned therefore ask the House to enact necessary legislation to ensure that the difference between the Aged Couple Pension and the Aged Single Pension is reduced to 18% from 33%.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I recently visited Coffs Harbour's Men's Resource Centre, run by Bridging the Gap Community Services, which is operated entirely by volunteers and community donations. The centre helps local men experiencing anxiety, depression or homelessness by providing counselling, meals and a safe place to regroup. The men they see are often socially or financially disadvantaged; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men; men suffering from relationship breakdowns or trauma, or mental health challenges; or men who have recently been released from custody. It receives no government funding, something that I hope to assist with in the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO is Jean Clayton, who started the service about 15 years ago and does a wonderful job. The centre is run out of a modern, attractive house in the Coffs Harbour CBD through the generosity of local business owners Bruce Hibbard and his partner, Bronwyn Stephens. Bruce has been a builder in the Coffs Harbour region for 40 years and now constructs new homes all over the state, including in Port Macquarie, Tamworth, Dubbo, Mudgee and Orange. Bruce and Bronwyn are truly generous people, as they let Bridging the Gap Community Services be run from their house for free because they believe in the benefits it provides to the local community. I thank them as well as all the wonderful volunteers at Bridging the Gap.</span>

For those with an interest in politics, opening your <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> on a Saturday morning was how it began. It was like walking into a thunderstorm. There, hovering like a cloud at the top of his words, was his face—not so much to welcome you in but to give fair warning of what was to come, and then it was on for young and old. An Alan Ramsey column could absolutely rock with thunder, and the lightning that came with it served two purposes: (1) it gave flashes of illumination amid the darkness and (2) it scorched everyone it hit. But even the most ferocious of Alan's writing was an expression of tough love from a man who knew that those of us in this place could and should do better. </span>

He was not afraid to be wrong. He was not afraid to be sentimental or to express his admiration. In an age where cool rationality was the supposed ideal of political journalism, he let his head and his heart rule his writing, sometimes in rocky tandem. Alan Ramsey was indeed a giant of journalism. May he rest in peace.</span>

Whilst we have made some progress over recent months—we have allocated over $25 million to ensure the northern basin is properly metered and we have been successful in splitting the Murray-Darling Basin Authority as we search for a government authority who should be, in the words of Mick Keelty, 'a single source of truth'—it is shameful that they cannot be trusted to tell the truth in the way that they should. </span>

As we look to ensure that the spirit of the agreement is honoured we also need to ensure that we cast no more pain and damage on our farmers and their associated supply chain businesses. That is why we clearly state that 450 gigalitres of up water cannot be delivered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can still deliver the environmental outcomes that have been identified. We need to use engineering and civil construction to deliver these environmental objectives. A great example of this is the work to bring the Coorong from its current hypersalinity to a level of salinity that's closer to seawater. By using a range of equivalency measures we believe that we can complete the environmental objectives and outcomes without taking any more water out of agriculture. Nobody wants to see more water leaving agriculture. I commend the minister for pushing these equivalency measures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 11 November 2020, of the Honourable Dame Margaret Georgina Constance Guilfoyle AC DBE, a Minister and a Senator for the State of Victoria from 1971 to 1987, place on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we acknowledge the passing of a great Australian—the first woman in cabinet with a ministerial portfolio and the first woman ever to hold a major economic portfolio. She was a trailblazer in every sense of the word. Dame Margaret often remarked, 'What matters is not that I was first; what matters is that I am not the last.' If Dame Margaret's achievement was simply to pry open the door of the cabinet room then that in itself would be historically significant, but that is not the full story. Margaret Guilfoyle made her own mark as a minister in the Fraser government and had a lasting influence on those she met. Every government of consequence has its mainstays, the pillars who are there through its entirety. Margaret Guilfoyle was one such pillar in the Fraser government, as Minister for Education, Minister for Social Security and Minister for Finance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was meticulous, authoritative, intellectually rigorous, calm, confident and no nonsense. She knew what she believed and she understood why. Her beliefs were grounded in real-life experience. Margaret was born in Belfast in 1926. When she was a young child her family left the city of her birth and set out for Melbourne. They were a middle-class family that was somewhat sheltered from the ravages of the Great Depression, but when Margaret was 10 years old calamity arrived, with the sudden death of her father. Her mother was left with three young children and no family within 10,000 miles. In those hard years Margaret saw firsthand what life was like as a single mother. It taught her that she had to find the skills for adulthood to protect her from economic adversity, so Margaret set about getting an education. She worked full-time all through her secretarial and accounting studies. She graduated just as the Second World War was ending. Her searing childhood experiences were surely in her mind when, as Minister for Social Security, she had a number of stoushes with the then federal Treasurer, Phillip Lynch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the new Fraser government, Phillip Lynch was charged with reining in spending. The largest spending portfolio was social security. It is said that the then Treasurer, let it be known, thought she was the most uncooperative minister in the work of budget repair—so uncooperative, in fact, that a Sydney paper carried a headline declaring Margaret Guilfoyle 'Minister Unhelpful'. She said the headline was the nicest she had ever received, and it became a badge of honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By her calculation, 83 per cent of payments made in her portfolio went to women. Her view was that welfare can be something that you build upon, and that was her guiding light as a minister. She oversaw major reform of the national child endowment scheme, switching from tax rebates to cash payments and renaming it family allowance. She presided over a major expansion of government support for preschool, child care and after-school care. In what may have seemed an irony to some, the minister who resisted spending control the most was subsequently made Minister for Finance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago we farewelled Susan Ryan, a trailblazer herself. She recounted many times how she studied and watched Dame Margaret. She saw the resistance, in that genteel chamber across the way, every time Dame Margaret rose to speak. She watched her calm and measured approach. Susan Ryan said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If anyone's performance should have established that a woman's place was in the Cabinet, it was Margaret Guilfoyle's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She wasn't alone. The late Joan Kirner said that Dame Margaret was 'the kind of politician I wanted to be'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Margaret knew how to draw out the best in people. She was a friend of mine for many years. Along with her husband, Stan, the Guilfoyles have given me friendship, encouragement and support. Stan best articulated why Margaret left an abiding legacy. He said, 'She was about principle, not politics'—always principle. Dame Margaret and Stan were married for 68 years. Stan, a member of the Liberal Party for 74 years, introduced Margaret to the party, and they were both members of the Camberwell South branch and stalwarts of the Victorian division. They had a partnership of equals, supporting each other's careers as they raised a wonderful family together. Yesterday, when I spoke to Stan, he said a journalist had recently asked him, 'When was your last fight with Dame Margaret?' He said: 'We never had our first. We would always listen to each other, and we would always respect each other.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a coincidence of history that Margaret Guilfoyle died 45 years to the day after the swearing in of Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister. A generation has passed since those tumultuous times. Many of the titans of that time have faded with the passing of the years, but Dame Margaret's memory and her legacy grow and grow. As the Prime Minister said when her passing was announced: 'Dame Margaret continues to beckon us. She beckons us as a country, as a government, as a party and as individuals to see this place, to see our politics, as reflective, as broad and as representative of the people we all serve. She pried open those doors for everyone—every background, every gender and every creed. That is the legacy of Dame Margaret Guilfoyle.' To Stan, their children, Georgina, Anne and Geoffrey, and their grandchildren, I extend our deepest sympathies. May she rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:09</span>):  I rise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to join the government in paying tribute on this condolence motion for Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. In the maternity wards of Northern Ireland, 1926 was a big year for political pioneers. Among the newborns was Gerry Fitt, who would be the first leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, advocating for a united Ireland. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you had Ian Paisley, firebrand preacher, founder of the Democratic Unionist Party and First Minister of Northern Ireland. In the middle, in the broad ground in between, was Margaret McCartney, the future Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and Australia's first female cabinet minister. Judging by her actions in later life, Dame Margaret would have been a force for good in her native land—she was someone who brought people together—but it was not to be and, in 1928, Belfast's loss was Victoria's gain. Australia was no soft landing, though. As a child of the Great Depression, Margaret lost her father when she was just 10. Her mother was left to raise three children during what was already a time of immense challenge. These were tough experiences, and the lessons that they bestowed never left Margaret. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When political life eventually came calling, she came up against that question that is still asked only of women: how will you manage to be a politician and a parent? Her answer boiled down to, 'That's my business.' We've heard so much about her achievements in her different portfolios, but it's worth going back to her first speech to the Senate, in which she revealed herself to be something of a renaissance woman. She spoke of the disproportionately high infrastructure costs that saddled the mining industry; she worried about the pressures placed on the environment by pollution and population growth; and she argued the case for boosting funding to the arts. The arts, she said, were 'an enrichment for all the people'. Dame Margaret showed it was possible to be governed equally by head and heart. She oversaw the expansion of child care; she fought for the extension of maternity leave for all women, not just Commonwealth employees; and she showed the Liberal Party's 'broad church' in action, by battling Treasurer Phillip Lynch over cuts that she thought would have a negative effect on mothers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is little wonder that she won the admiration of many in the Labor Party, among them Joan Kirner, Robert Ray and John Button. Indeed, on this side of the House, our only regret is that the great blossoming of her career was brought forward by the dismissal of the Whitlam government. It was a career that came dangerously close to an untimely end, thanks to an errant fishbone during dinner in Parliament House. She was turning blue by the time Senator Glen Sheil, a former GP, came to the rescue—one more example of the reminder that our Chief Opposition Whip got recently, that it's wise for any political party to have a few doctors in their ranks. The presence of the members for Macarthur and Lyne showed that in recent times. How did Dame Margaret respond to this near-death experience? She said, 'Thank you,' to her saviour and picked up the dinner conversation exactly where she'd left off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After politics, she pursued interests as varied as the law, children's television and mental health. And the honours, of course, kept coming—a richly lived life, richly recognised. It is a sombre coincidence that Dame Margaret's passing comes just a handful of weeks after Susan Ryan's—two women who will forever stand tall in the history of our great nation. On the day of Susan's state funeral last month, I wrote that the doors she opened will never be closed again. The same has rightly been said of Dame Margaret. As Susan herself once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If anyone's performance should have established that a woman's place was in the Cabinet, it was Margaret Guilfoyle's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Margaret in turn took a special interest in Susan's career. As she said of her own achievements, 'It had to be very important I was not the last.' She achieved that and so much more. In our pride, in our sorrow, we are grateful for the stroke of good fortune that her family chose Australia, a choice that led ultimately to the enrichment of their adopted country. Our condolences to her husband, Stan, and to all her children and grandchildren. May she rest in peace.</span>

With reference to last summer's bushfires, the dozens of fires burning across the country right now and the heatwave set to worsen this week, can the minister confirm that over the past year not one cent of the $400 million available for bushfire resilience and recovery in the $4 billion Emergency Response Fund has been spent? The Prime Minister says he doesn't hold a hose, but he does hold the taxpayers' chequebook. Why hasn't he delivered the funding he announced?</span>

The fund that had bipartisan support through this parliament in fact set in place $200 million that was available. Of that, $150 million is available to rebuild after catastrophic events only, as that legislation that those opposite voted for quite clearly points out, once all other programs and funds have been exhausted. Subsequently we put in place a $2 billion fund. In fact, of those electorates opposite, over $159 million has gone into Eden-Monaro alone—one electorate. So the scale of this disaster was of a magnitude that that fund was superseded by the $2 billion we put in place to make sure that those people impacted by that disaster were supported.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an additional $50 million set aside for resilience programs. We have taken advice from the director-general, who is providing me and the government with those programs. That has taken place after consultation with communities not just in the bushfire region but right across the country, because this is for all natural disasters. It's also important for those opposite, particularly the member who asked the question, to understand quite explicitly the trauma which these people went through, and that not everyone had recovered emotionally to the point where they were prepared to have input. This is about people, not politics. Whatever needs to be spent will be spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made sure that, of that $2 billion, $1.2 billion has already gone out. In addition, there was over $250 million in immediate support to those that were impacted. This is about making sure that we exhaust all the funds. We will have no hesitation in spending the last $50 million once we get the Director-General Emergency Management Australia providing us with that advice. That is the responsible thing to do. That is, in fact, the legislation that those opposite voted for. So either you're asleep at the wheel and you didn't read it or you are, unfortunately, playing politics with the trauma and the 33 lives that were lost in Black Summer. This place should be above that. That bill was about bipartisanship and a way forward. Unfortunately, if you wish to politicise that, that is more a reflection on you than it is on us.</span>

We have not rejected that. It is important to understand that it is the fire commissioners from around this country that determine the make-up of the aerial aircraft that we take. It should be about the fact that we let the professionals make that determination. When you talk about a sovereign fleet, let me just give you a statistic. AFAC is the peak council of Australian fire commissioners and NAFC is AFAC's commercial entity that procures those aircraft. Of the 158 aircraft that are sitting on tarmacs around the country at the moment, 128 are Australian. AFAC and NAFC are already working through the fact that there will need to be Australian aircraft on the ground. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will now work with the states to make sure that we work through that recommendation together because they are the ones with the expertise to determine whether you need a large aerial tanker, small winged aircraft or helicopters. They are the ones that, through their jurisdiction, will decide exactly the type of aircraft. It is fire commissioners, not politicians, who should make that determination, because that is the meticulous planning they went through last year. To say that they didn't is a slur on those fire commissioners and the professionalism with which they have undertaken in being prepared for not just last season but this season. That is what we will continue to do. We will continue to take the advice from the professionals, not from politicians. Again, this isn't about politics. It's disappointing that you will not respect the sovereignty and the expertise of those men and women who are the very best fire commissioners in the world as far as I'm concerned. They proved themselves in Black Summer better than anyone, under the circumstances that they were in. Not once did the government let them down in terms of having the assets that they required.</span>

In December, they came back to us and said they required more. The Prime Minister and I acted swiftly and put an additional $11 million on the table to make sure there were large aerial tankers on the ground. That is what we do. We work with the professionals. Don't use the desperation of politics to politicise something that should be above that. This is about understanding professionals, not about politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  [by video link] I thank you, Mr Speaker, for your understanding. I understand we've now got that sorted. I also thank the House for their support and cooperation in enabling me to join you in this way today. I'm doing this because of isolation, as most Australians would know. That isolation was brought about by the fact that we had the opportunity very recently for me to visit Tokyo and be the first national leader to meet with the new Prime Minister of Japan, having had that first discussion with him soon after his elevation to Prime Minister. That bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Suga in Japan marked a new level in the relationship between Australia and Japan, in both pursuing defence agreements between our two countries and also engaging on important economic issues, in particular, lower emissions technology, particularly in the area of hydrogen production. The first shipment is due to leave Australia very shortly. Hydrogen is one of those key emissions-reducing fuels which enable us to realise our ambitions for a lower emissions future and net zero emissions as soon as possible, as we discussed, and the many other technology partnerships we have, which will bring about great economic opportunities for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond that, our engagement with the region over the last few weeks has seen us engage with the East Asia Summit, APEC and the G20, of course, and, most recently, we have had the first of our annual dialogues with the European Union. We were able to pursue those same issues around lower emissions and, importantly, the EU free trade agreement, which, together with the UK free trade agreement, is the next big step in further broadening the trade opportunities for Australians. That has already risen to 70 per cent of our two-way trade, up from 26 per cent when we first came to office, broadening those trade opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are living in a more uncertain world. We are living in a world where there is great uncertainty that has been created by the pandemic and also the re-emergence of tensions across the globe. Our opportunity to engage in regional forums like the East Asia Summit, where we candidly addressed the issues—whether it's the rule of law when it comes to oceans or, indeed, reaching a new RCEP agreement—a new trade agreement—involving 15 of the economies in our region, a new economic opportunity, a new community of economics in our region, which hopefully provides the basis for greater cooperation within the region and for dealing with any tensions. That was followed through in our work with the G20, of course, and the APEC summit, where Australia has always been a positive contributor. This work helps make Australia safe. It helps make Australia more prosperous. I'm fortunate that the House has extended to me this cooperation today to enable me to participate as a result of our involvement in those many issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:28</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for her question. She has worked very, very hard for her regional Victorians in the face of some restrictions in Melbourne. Regional Victorians have done the nation proud. They certainly make sure that they punch above their weight when it comes to agricultural output and economic benefit to this nation. Our comeback from COVID-19 is being driven by regional Australia, by those communities around the Mallee, those communities right around our country—those rural, regional and, perhaps most importantly, remote communities, who have done our nation proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we responded to the global pandemic swiftly and decisively. We worked to bring projects forward. We worked, indeed, to up the ante on regional development. And we worked very, very hard to provide direct economic stimulus. We are ensuring that those communities that are ready to recover, ready to rebuild and ready to regenerate have the necessary tools at their disposal to invest in their growth and deliver our comeback. Every industry sector, business and farm in some way is contributing. Across the board, they all rely on regional Australia and certainly our farmers, three times a day, every day of every week. Whether it's the fresh produce on our supermarket shelves or the transport links between the states, our regions bolster our economy and our productivity, and we should be very, very proud and mindful of that fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing direct funding to local governments through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program has been so important. In the member's electorate of Mallee we are providing more than $35.8 million in direct funding under this program. As I travel around the nation—albeit a little restricted—local councils and local mayors are very pleased. One of the many projects now underway across the dozen local councils the member for Mallee represents is the upgrade of Wargan Road in Mildura. This project will improve safety for local road users whilst also increasing productivity for local freight operators, increasing jobs, increasing efficiencies and making sure we've got the right connectivity in the right places right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's $110 billion infrastructure rollout over the next decade is making such a difference to local safety work such as Wargan Road. Regional Australia is diverse, and so is our investment. Many parts of Australia, after dealing with successive droughts, are now experiencing a bumper grain harvest. Local Ouyen farmer Dean 'Spot' Munro has said it's the best barley year ever for the district, and possibly the best wheat year as well. We need better roads and rail to ensure we get that delivery of grain, and we are doing just that.</span>

It wasn't started by a Treasurer or a Prime Minister. It has been a longstanding part of our social security program. To understand why income averaging did not begin with the minister in 2015, that's where history becomes exceptionally important. I seek—in fact, I'll just table an example letter from a data-matching program from 1994. It says to this citizen, 'If you do not reply, we'll use the tax office's information about your income and we'll write to you about how much money you'll need to pay back.'

                  </a>  The reason why a minister in 2015 didn't begin it is that it began back in 1994, and I table that. I further point out that I actually got the letter within the system that was used in all cases at that time, and I table that as well to show it's not a one-off. Building, of course, as to why it didn't begin in 2015, I'll also read from a press release here from the member for McMahon on 13 July 2010, where the member boasts, 'Centrelink conducted 3.8 million payment reviews, resulting in the reduction of 641,000 payments, saving $2.27 billion.' It began in 1994 and was built out by the member opposite in 2010.</span>

The Inland Rail will run through Wangaratta, Glenrowan, Benalla and Euroa, with substantial impacts on these towns. This could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the amenity and accessibility of these railway precincts while delivering Inland Rail's aims; however, the ARTC, which is 100 per cent owned by this government, says it has insufficient budget for amenity upgrades. Will the Deputy Prime Minister commit to providing additional funding to the ARTC for these works and deliver the legacy these communities are calling for?</span>

Last Friday, indeed, I was with the member for Parkes at Moree, where we turned the first sod for the Narrabri to North Star section, 171 kilometres, $693.8 million. Recently—on 15 September, in fact—the Parkes to Narromine section, the first of 13, was completed, and it was great to hammer in that golden spike. Perhaps more importantly, 99 local businesses were successful in helping, in getting the benefit of the $110 million procurement. </span>

It took a Liberal-National government to be delivering it. It took us to be delivering it. Now, 16,000 jobs will be supported by Inland Rail during construction and operation, 2,800 of them in Victoria, and certainly the member's electorate will benefit from that. She asks about particular stations. Benalla station: while a full upgrade to the Benalla station is out of scope for the delivery of Inland Rail, the ARTC has committed to capture the requirements for the Benalla station precinct as a whole, in an effort to deliver a solution that meets requirements as best as possible, to complement the council's planning schemes and not preclude opportunities to expand or upgrade the station in the—</span>

Appreciating that you don't always get what you want, when it comes to negotiations with state governments, they need to, of course, have some responsibility for some infrastructure. I'm happy to work with Labor governments; indeed, that's what I do—because it's about delivery, it's about outcomes, it's about people. And I'm more than happy to work with governments of any political persuasion to get things done, and that's what I have been doing. I'm happy, of course, to work with the communities involved, whether it's Wangaratta or Glenrowan. I will add that the ARTC has provided a total of $380,000 to more than 120 community groups across the alignment, supporting organisations and supporting services that support the local community. But I'm happy to work with the member as well.</span>

I know that he is very proud of his electorate and their resilience through the most challenging of times. The people of Monash, around 60,000 taxpayers in Monash, will get tax relief as a result of the policies we announced in this year's budget and have subsequently legislated through the parliament. Around 22,000 pensioners and others on income support in the electorate of Monash have got two $750 payments as a result of the policies of this side of the House, and around 5,000 businesses in Monash have been able to access the JobKeeper program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The JobKeeper program has been a remarkable program. They're not my words; they're the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It has helped keep that formal connection between employers and employees. We heard recently from the RBA that JobKeeper helped save at least 700,000 jobs, and we heard from Treasury that but for the JobKeeper program the unemployment rate would be five points higher. In September 3.6 million Australians were on JobKeeper. We have the most recent ATO data for the month of October, and that shows that in October there were two million fewer Australian workers on JobKeeper compared to September and 450,000 fewer businesses on JobKeeper than in September. That is a sign that Australia's economic recovery is well underway and that momentum is building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard right across the country wonderful stories of how JobKeeper has kept that formal connection between employers and employees. Whether it is Flinders Island Aviation in Bass, Deli Chicchi in the electorate of Curtin or the F45 gym in the electorate of Ryan, there are stories right across the country of how JobKeeper has supported Australians to stay in a job. Recently I was in Western Sydney, in the electorate of Lindsay, where I met with a crane driver and others who have graduated from JobKeeper, and I was in the electorate of Sturt meeting with a husband-and-wife team who run a cafe in the electorate of Sturt who have graduated from JobKeeper. Right across the country we are seeing the graduation out of JobKeeper.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers go together with the other positive economic data we have recently seen: 178,000 jobs created last month; the effective unemployment rate coming down from 9.3 to 7.4 per cent; consumer confidence up 11 of the last 12 weeks; and Australia's AAA credit rating reaffirmed. The Morrison government is getting on with creating jobs across the country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's an incredibly important question. We are working to diversify our market opportunities, including through FTAs with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru, which will provide better market access for 99 per cent of Australian goods. Our trade agreements with PACER Plus will enter into force on 13 December 2020, building on our record of delivering trade agreements with Korea, Japan, China and the TPP-11 countries. We have finalised eight FTAs since coming to office, and there are more on the agenda. We have signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the government is pursuing trade agreements with the European Union, the United Kingdom and the Pacific Alliance. We have already lifted our share of trade covered by trade agreements from 26 per cent to 70 per cent, and we are working to grow it further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses that export hire, on average, 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than nonexporters. And importantly, in the budget, we announced that we're investing $6.6 million to pursue new free trade agreement opportunities around the world and to boost digital trade within our region. In the budget, we also announced that Minister Birmingham would join with the Minister for Home Affairs in leading a new joint ministerial task force on simplified trade, working with a dedicated industry advisory council to make trading simpler and cheaper by reducing red tape, increasing the resilience of our supply chains and supporting trade growth and expansion. The government is improving regional digital trading conditions and making it easier for exporters to do business, including in areas of personal data protection, e-invoicing, paperless customs procedures and electronic certification for agricultural exports. And we're doing this because trade creates jobs. One in five jobs are trade related. When you go to regional Australia—and I know the DPM will be very pleased to hear this—it's actually one in four. That is why we are focusing on diversifying our export markets. We know it is incredibly important to do this work and we will continue to do it. We've negotiated eight FTAs, and we have more on the table, because we know our economic comeback is about creating jobs right across the nation and in regional Australia.</span>

But I make the point that our agency deals with many of these issues on a daily basis. Last week I was in Toowoomba visiting the Toowoomba service centre, and my entrance on that day was delayed because of a domestic violence incident inside. We have a system built just to record instances that my agency deals with of self-harm, challenges and violent behaviour to the point now that, at the entrances to all Services Australia shopfronts, we now have security guards, because we take the duty of care to both the citizens of Australia and our staff quite seriously. These are complex areas and they're complex matters. We deal with complex situations right across all of our 327 service centres. I'll most certainly get for the member the data that he has requested, but it's important that the House understands the challenge that Services Australia staff deal with, which is why I started my answer to the very first question from the Leader of the Opposition by thanking the hardworking men and women of Services Australia because they deal with difficult circumstances every day.</span>

More generally, we know that the challenge that the world is facing continues apace. Sadly, the world has now reached over 62½ million COVID-19 cases. We know that the world is heading inevitably this week to 1½ million lives lost. We see that, outside of Australia, the challenge of COVID-19 is great and significant and tragic. Within Australia we are in a very fortunate position. We have had real challenges and genuine loss, but Australia's outcome is one which is the envy of the world. Indeed, only in recent days Dr Anthony Fauci said within the Australian media that Australia has been the epitome of success. It is an outcome that is to be attributed to many, many people, but in particular we owe our work to the very clear plan that Australia set out right from the outset—containment to flatten the curve and the building of capacity to protect Australians. That proposal, with regard to vaccine, saw us reach over 40 million telehealth consultations last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in relation to our response with regard to containment, we are likely to pass 10 million tests that Australians have carried out and conducted. In particular, the work that we have done with regard to setting up testing capacity, when there was no such thing as a COVID-19 test in January, has been an extraordinary national achievement. The Australian government has put in place a series of measures—147 GP respiratory clinics. We said that we would put in place a hundred. We said that we would do this during the course of May. We achieved this outcome at a much higher rate and at an earlier time than we pledged. More specifically, in March we put in place Medicare funding for COVID-19 tests. In addition, on 13 March we put in place an agreement with the states and territories where we would contribute to funding and to outcomes. All of these things have allowed Australia to have not only one of the highest testing rates in the world but also, as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said, one of the most accurate testing regimes. Throughout this we sourced the materials, which were in short supply around the world. Australia kept that airbridge going to provide the tests which kept the nation safe, and for that I thank Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Whilst I have enormous sympathy for Mrs Madgwick as a grieving mother in this respect, the department will collect in terms of debt recovery almost $5 billion from over a million Australians over the coming 12 and 18 months. There are many reasons why the department collects debts—many, many reasons why—so it is a very complex matter in terms of where it sits, and we should respect that.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, I would just like to say that I only concluded two sentences before the member for Sydney started interjecting. I've always found it fascinating every time she pops her head up on vocational educational and training because the member for Sydney was part of the cabinet that actually delivered nine successive cuts to vocational education and training. Nine successive cuts, $1.2 billion—the member for Sydney was part of the cabinet that actually delivered that. But let me tell you, Mr Speaker, this government is going to remedy all of the damage that the Labor government did to vocational education and training in this country. We are delivering because we understand how important vocational education and training and the skills that that is able to deliver to this country is.</span>

                  </a>  We have demonstrated our support for apprentices and trainees, particularly during the COVID pandemic. We've done this through our supporting apprentices and trainees' wage subsidy that began in April of this year and will continue through to March of next year. I'm really pleased to report to the House that, as of last week, this measure alone has assisted more than 56,000 businesses, and 98 per cent of those are small businesses, and we've helped them retain 103,000 apprentices and trainees. This includes 20,000 brickies, 15,000 electricians, 10,000 plumbers, 5,000 hairdressers, and 8,000 automotive mechanics and automotive electricians. That is the result that we are looking for out of the money that we have spent on vocational education and training. We have supported, and we will continue to support, the vocational education and training sector because we know how important it is to deliver the skills that we need as a nation as we come through this COVID pandemic.</span>

As I said in the first answer, this government did not invent income averaging. It did not. And, as I tabled in the House, the process of income averaging has gone back at least 26 years. Substantially. I also pointed out, reading the member for McMahon's press statement from 2010, that those opposite went forward on 3.8 million compliance-type reviews and raised $2.2 billion. So, the collection of debts is an ongoing process. </span>

From August this year, the agency has been working with the estates of those customers to process refunds—a process that's been overseen by appropriately trained staff. Conflating that with issues of harm and with suicide, I suggest, is not something that we should be walking into quickly. It's something we should be treating with care and respect right across the House.</span>

                  </a>  I was telling those opposite about the importance of the HomeBuilder program. It has been supporting those one million jobs. That is what this government has done with HomeBuilder. That's why yesterday we announced a three-month extension to the program. This extension will also allow every single person who has made an application and signed a contract to have six months to start their project rather than three months. This is necessary because demand for the program has been so great that builders have said to the government, 'We need more time to fit in all these customers.' This will mean that this pipeline of work will continue all the way to 2022.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday the Treasurer and I were at a Stockland site. Importantly, the managing director and CEO of Stockland said in relation to the extension of the HomeBuilder program, 'Stockland now has the opportunity to accelerate an additional $1.5 billion of construction spend across the housing and land market because of this announcement.'

                <span class="HPS-Small">HomeBuilder has been the most successful Federal stimulus for the construction industry of the past two decades and has kept hundreds of thousands of Australians employed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  I thank the member for Dawson for his question, and I thank him and every member in this House for their local leadership during last year's disaster season. Tragically, just through the Black Summer, we lost 33 lives. The Bushfires and Natural Hazards CRC last week gave their seasonal outlook for December to February, and said that we are moving towards a La Nina—strongly towards a La Nina—basis. But it's important to understand that we are currently fighting bushfires. In fact, there are 46 bushfires alive around New South Wales at the moment, 29 in Queensland and six in other parts of the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, between the state fire commissioners and Emergency Management Australia, we are preparing to pivot and pivot quickly from bushfires to what could be a longer and more severe cyclone season and flooding season, and doing that all under the auspices of COVID-19. That's making sure that we can get emergency service personnel from one state to another in a COVID-safe environment, making sure we're protecting them and their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making sure that we've put assets on the ground—an extra $11 million in aerial assets to make sure that AFAC, the peak council for Australian fire commissioners, can determine what assets they require. Whether it be large aerial tankers, whether it be helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft, we allow them to determine that. They're the professionals who keep us safe year after year. We've also got $88 million going into research, and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and I will now be working through how that research is done to give our emergency service personnel and our communities the cutting-edge technology and information to be better prepared for natural disasters into the future. Also, in terms of telecommunications, which came under great stress during this year's Black Summer, there's $37 million for improving our telecommunications through natural disasters and an additional $8 million through the public safety mobile capability program. That's about looking at ways in which we can give our emergency services personnel the equipment that they require that will stress-test through emergencies. It's important to make sure they're properly equipped, with the right equipment, to communicate during a natural disaster. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also $20 million for the Household Resilience Program, for those in North Queensland that face those cyclones year in year out. That's about allowing households to do renovations to their homes to be more prepared and make them more resilient to cyclones. It's in fact also saving them up to $300 a year on their premiums, which is a significant saving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working with the states now on the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations. I've already met with all the state ministers to make sure that they provide us with their responses to those recommendations, and we'll work through those. Whether or not that be a national system of hazard warning, it behoves each and every one of us to have a plan for natural disasters not only because we owe it to our families but because we also owe it to the brave men and women who are prepared to protect us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to continue the comments I made earlier on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the associated bill. Among the most heartbreaking stories we MPs hear in our offices are from those going through the agonies of a Family Court matter. The process is brutal for so many partners and their children. There are many issues that get raised with me, and I'm going to focus on those that are most relevant to this legislation that the government has put forward. I support the amendment moved by our shadow Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time it takes to have a court resolution, which typically comes only after a long time of conflict and heartache, is simply appalling. The average amount of time it's taking for a case to be heard in the Family Court is 18.6 months from the date the matter is filed to the date on which the trial commences. In the Federal Circuit Court, the average is 17.5 months. In some cases, it's taking more than two years from the date of a judgement being reserved to the date on which the judgement's finally delivered. These are delays that impact profoundly on the life of every single person within those families and on their ability to move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parramatta court has one of the longer wait times for court-appointed family consultants to produce family reports, and of course that's the critical document providing an independent assessment of issues in a case. Those are the reports that help judges make life-changing decisions about the arrangements for children. The main focus of all those reports is the child: what is in the best interests of the child? For a report in the Federal Circuit Court at Parramatta, the wait is eight months, and in the Family Court it's six months. This adds further delays. They're beaten by the Sydney courts, which have slightly longer delays. So for people living in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury there is no choice but to wait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think every person in this chamber accepts that there are serious problems in the Family Court at the moment. The main cause of those problems isn't a secret. The Australian Law Reform Commission found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last seven years, what we have seen with the problems of the Australian family law system is a story of absolute neglect by those opposite. The system has been neglected by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, neglected by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and neglected by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. For a start, the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges haven't been replaced in any sort of timely manner as they left. There's been no increase in funding despite the increasing demand. There's been review after review, with dozens of sensible recommendations, and those have not been applied. It's all been ignored. It's all been neglected. The gutting of community legal centres and legal aid hasn't helped either. So here we are. Instead of working to fix the family law system the government decides to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that all the experts say will make what is already a bad situation even worse for Australian families and, as we should be putting first here, Australian children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to state very clearly that what we see the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General doing here with these bills is essentially to seek to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone court. This court system is a very proud Whitlam legacy. Like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia, everything from Medicare to a world-leading superannuation system to providing free legal services to people in need, the Family Court of Australia has been a long-lasting and fundamental reform. We know now, though, that it needs to get better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act 1975 brought about two major changes. The first was no-fault divorce and the second was the establishment of a family court. Let's be clear, it is a specialist multidisciplinary court—not specialist judges but a specialist court system—for the resolution of family disputes. Of course, there was huge debate on when those changes were made. History shows there were 28 sitting hours in the debate on that bill. There were many disagreements and much debate across both sides. The members of that House, 45 years ago, took it seriously. It's very disappointing to see how few members opposite are interested in speaking on these reforms today. There are plenty of people on our side who want to talk about this very important issue but very, very few opposite. You have to wonder if people even know what they're going to be voting for when the bells ring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the detail of the legislation: I suppose we should be thankful that the Morrison government isn't trying to reinstitute fault based divorce—that's the upside. But what it is proposing to do, by undoing the second of those major changes that the Family Law Act introduced, is combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one court with two divisions, and that court would be called the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The current Family Court will become Division 1 and the current Federal Circuit Court will become Division 2 if this legislation passes. Both of them would operate under the leadership of a single Chief Justice and a Deputy Chief Justice, with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. The Appeals Division of the Family Court isn't being replaced by anything. Instead, all Division 1 judges would be able to hear appeals, either as a single judge or as part of a full court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government originally proposed the merger in the last parliament, the current Attorney-General said he would stop appointing new judges to Division 1 as current judges retired, which would have gradually abolished the Family Court over time. He's backed away from that position and promised to keep appointing them, but nothing in this bill guarantees the continued existence of Division 1. The Attorney-General made his intentions for this merger very clear in the last parliament, and now we're meant to assume that he has changed his view as he says, 'Trust me.' I'm sorry; this side does not trust what those opposite say. We look at what you do. Those opposite very rarely can be trusted to do the things they say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if this bill is amended to guarantee the continued existence of Division 1, that doesn't address the fundamental problem with this bill, which is that instead of increasing the specialisation in the family law system, which is what has been recommended by review after review, the Morrison government is watering it down. It shouldn't be a surprise, but it is a disappointment that this will profoundly harm Australian families, and in particular children, at what is probably their greatest time of need. This bill robs the Family Court of its essential distinguishing feature, and it collapses the Family Court into what is already one of the busiest, most poorly resourced and overburdened courts, the Federal Circuit Court.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're one of the six Federal Court judges at Parramatta trying to manage the current caseload for Western Sydney, which includes families in my electorate of Macquarie, you might be one of the three judges with 400 to 500 cases on your docket. All we're going to do, as the feedback from experts has demonstrated, is create longer waits, poorer decisions, and more delays and anguish for families already going through horrible experiences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about specialisation. If anything, the need for specialisation in this court has grown. When Whitlam established the family law court, he talked about a court with interrelated, co-located services and resources. Specialisation doesn't mean specialist judges; it's this whole system that operates around them. It was about creating an environment that would have regard to what Whitlam described as the 'human problems' of couples and families, not just their legal rights. For vulnerable children and families who need the family court system, they need one that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their particular needs and vulnerabilities. That specialised understanding is paramount, but that's one of the things we're going to lose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd expect that any decision about changing a system that has served us for so many years would be based on sound evidence. You'd expect that the government would have consulted widely. That has not happened. The Morrison government claims that the merger has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. The only problem is that none of the reports listed on the Attorney-General's website as the source of the evidence even recommends this sort of radical reform. Not one of those reports even considered this sort of reform. In fact, only one of the five reports that is on the website recommended restructuring the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court, and it recommended an entirely different model which would have maintained a standalone specialist family law court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also point out that, more recently, the interim report of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System—the so-called 'Hanson family law inquiry'—listed almost 70 reviews of the family law system, and not a single one of these reviews had ever recommended that the family courts be structured in the way the government is proposing. So please don't stand there and tell us that this is based on expert recommendations and advice. This government, this Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have ignored all of the experts and the reviews. The only thing being cited is the findings of a six-week desktop review of data by two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Imagine that! You are making the most profound changes to the family court system in more than 40 years on the basis of a desktop review by two accountants. I fear the consequences that this will have for families. I urge them to reach out to me as we go through this process to find out what sorts of consequences it has. I hope the government then listens to those consequences and reconsiders the decisions that it has made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time that I have remaining, I want to go to some of the experts who have spoken about this and put on the record their comments and findings about the proposal. There has been no meaningful consultation with the users of the family law system—Australian families. There's been nothing with the legal profession or other family specialists. Other than the Chief Justice, the government didn't even consult the judges of the Family Court, which is just extraordinary. If he'd bothered to listen, the Attorney-General would have heard from the Law Council of Australia, which undertook the most comprehensive landmark report on the family law system last year. Their advice was the opposite of what is happening here. They advised that a strengthened standalone specialist family law court with an increase in capacity to deal with family violence specialisation was the way forward. We've also got more than 110 stakeholders—ranging from women's legal services, community legal services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, child protection advocates, disability services—all writing to the Attorney-General asking him—begging him—to abandon this proposal. They've been ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish with the words of the very first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Elizabeth Evatt AC, who said that the proposed merger will lead to undesirable outcomes for children and families. She says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Merging the Family Court into a generalist court will undermine the integrity and the structural specialisation of the Family Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This should not be happening.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the associated bill. Almost by definition, people who are coming before the family law courts in Australia have had a relationship break down. They've had their hopes for the future, the sort of family life they wanted to have, the sort of relationships they wanted to have sometimes not be fulfilled and other times be smashed—sometimes literally smashed, by domestic violence, and often smashed by the consequences of job loss, of cultural and religious difficulties within a relationship, of a community where they couldn't find support to get through difficulties. And people who are accessing the parens patriae jurisdiction of the Family Court by definition have such a difficult situation with a child—and the child has such a difficult situation about rights, often to do with decisions about their health—that they need a court to assist them through it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family law jurisdiction is a place of social policy as well as a place of law, because it's about people's lives; not just their legal rights. As the great Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam said in November 1974, when speaking in the House of Representatives about the transformative Family Law Bill: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He put it this way: it's a court that will 'have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO RFD QC—the second Chief Justice of the Family Court, serving in that position between 1988 and 2004, and a man of intellect and experience—said, when he was making comments about the absolute unsuitability of this piece of legislation to pass: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many involve the determination of important issues relating to children, including their rights and need for protection, not only from individuals, but also from government in its myriad forms. Many also involve problems of family violence and the effects of it upon the parties and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the first Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Elizabeth Evatt AC, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">the bill we are debating today in this place—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is astounding that in the face of those comments, let alone the some 110 stakeholders who oppose this legislation—this reheated legislation—the current Attorney-General and all of the members of the government on that side of the chamber want to push this legislation through. This is not about ideology; this is about the lives of vulnerable children, and it's about the lives of all of our friends and family. There can't be a person in this place who doesn't know someone who has had a marriage or significant relationship break down and had to go through the Family Court system. Surely, there can't be a person in this place who doesn't understand how important that system is to the lives of people who are going through, often, trauma that they never thought they would have to experience. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it in my community. We are incredibly fortunate in my community, in Dunkley, to have the Peninsula Community Legal Centre, the amazing lawyers that work there, the incomparable Jackie Galloway who runs the centre, the support staff and the partnerships that PCLC has made. PCLC looks after the most disadvantaged and marginalised in our community, as community legal centres do across our country. They look after people who otherwise fall through the gaps, who can't afford private lawyers. Despite the best intentions of the family law system, of those who devised it and those who are its custodians, it is not often a user-friendly place, and people need lawyers to get through. Places like PCLC look after people who would otherwise fall through the gaps because they can't afford private lawyers and they don't qualify for legal aid. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More people would qualify for legal aid if federal governments—this federal government—would put more money into the legal aid system. They could represent more people going through the trauma of a marriage breakdown and having to deal with sorting out child custody arrangements, sometimes when they fear that their child's welfare, let alone life, is in danger as a result of the access of their estranged partner. Peninsula Community Legal Centre's clients are low-income earners. About 75 per cent of their clients have no or low incomes, and the most common legal problem faced by clients of PCLC is family law. Fifty-four per cent of their clients experience family law problems and more than a third of those clients experience family violence. We know that not only is Australia in an ongoing epidemic of family violence but also COVID-19 has exacerbated it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law and family violence problems in my community that are looked after by PCLC are often complicated by the risk of homelessness, welfare concerns for children, disabilities or histories of substance abuse. These are complicated people with complicated lives who deserve a system that is specialised in looking after their needs and lawyers who are specialised in looking after their needs. PCLC, led by Jackie Galloway, are so concerned about the consequences of this piece of legislation that they were a signatory, in November last year, to an open letter to the Attorney-General along with—I haven't counted them—tens and tens and tens of people working in the family law system. It said the government's proposal to merge the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court is wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforms should strengthen a system, not lead to the diminution of specialisation. The government's proposed reforms, this legislation, will lead to the loss of a standalone specialist superior Family Court. Notwithstanding the talking points the Attorney-General has given to the backbenchers of the government saying that it won't, this bill will lead to the loss of a specialised family law court. It will lead to a loss of services for some of the most vulnerable of people in our community and it will do a disservice to what has, before this, been a proud legacy of the legal system in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that there are problems that can be fixed in the family law system. It is not inconsistent to stand here and be proud of our family law system and, at the same time, acknowledge that there are issues that need to be fixed. Some of those issues stem from something, one would think, as simple as properly funding the system, which this government has failed to do—budget after budget after budget. Some of those problems arise from the changes in society, from the increased prevalence and awareness of domestic violence and the need for the system to adapt to deal with that. But none of the problems in the family law system arise because we have a specialised family law court, and they won't be solved by merging it with the Federal Circuit Court full of people, some of whom have limited to no legal experience in the first place, of whom are mostly not specialists in family law. There's a reason people specialise in something. It's so they can give the best advice, the best judgement and the best outcome possible. This government doesn't like experts in a range of fields; we know that. But expertise is important. It means something. And we will lose that if this legislation goes through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As PCLC and the other signatories to the 11 November 2019 open letter to the Attorney-General said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We understand and support having a single entry point to the family courts and common rules so the family law system is easier for families to navigate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on in the next paragraph to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this can be done without abandoning the benefits otherwise available to children and families from a properly resourced and specialised court system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The entire family law sector opposes this legislation, and it is pure hubris and arrogance of the Attorney-General and those on that side of the parliament to say that, somehow or other, they know better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The briefing note published by the Law Council of Australia demolishes all of the speaking points that we've heard from the very few coalition members of parliament who are actually speaking on this legislation, which in itself says something. Here are the myths and misconceptions: everyone in the system has known for years it needs to be reformed, but no-one has able to agree on the best way. In the family law system, 110 stakeholders agree the merger is not the solution and oppose the bill because it will 'put families at risk'. This is a government that talks over and over again about the importance of protecting vulnerable children, and here they are putting forward legislation that the Law Council of Australia says will 'put families at risk'. They support the Family Court 2.0 model proposed by the New South Wales Bar Association. There are other options out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second misconception put forward by the government is that this merger has been informed by independent inquiries over a decade. No, it hasn't. Inquiry after inquiry has done the opposite of saying that the courts should be merged. A desktop review by an accounting firm is no replacement for the evidence given to inquiries by people who have worked in the system and people who have had their marriages and their relationships dealt with through the system—people who are actually experts in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council of Australia, anticipating the speaking points that would be used in the debate in the chamber today, have said that misconception No. 3—that the merger proposal will not abolish the Family Court—is wrong. The Attorney-General might have tweaked this version of the legislation from the last one and said, 'No, I won't follow on with that idea that we will stop appointing judges to division 1.' No-one believes what he says. Everyone is concerned that the outcome of this legislation is to abolish the Family Court. It won't increase efficiencies or reduce delays in the system. It won't save money. It will cost money, and it could well cost lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to respond to something that the member for Fisher said about the Lighthouse Project, which is about specialised family law court systems for domestic violence, and remind the member for Fisher and this chamber that that legislation should have gone through the parliament in February. Nine months later, we are still waiting for that pilot project to start, because the government didn't push it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of my community—the Peninsula Community Legal Centre led by Jackie Galloway, every single organisation that is involved in the family law system and the men, women and children who rely on that system for a fair and decent outcome for one of the most horrific times in their lives—I oppose this legislation, and I join the voices of everyone else who is asking the government and the Attorney-General to put aside ego, put aside a belief that they know more than others, listen to what the community is saying to them and withdraw this legislation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I stand here to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 as a bit of a veteran of the Family Court. I think it's quite well known that I'm onto my third husband now. This one's a keeper though! In all seriousness, I have had the experience of having to go through the Family Court under some very trying circumstances. I currently sit as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System, of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, are chair. I don't want to speak on your behalf, Deputy Speaker, but I think everybody on that committee has had moments where we absolutely despair at some of the stories that we are hearing about the experiences that people are having in the Family Court system as it currently is, regardless of which parent it is or whether they have children. The experiences of people going through the family law system at the moment really do warrant some special attention. There is no doubt that the system absolutely does need reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not the kind of reform that the system needs. Indeed, the member for Isaacs very eloquently earlier today gave us the background on the family law court, its inception and the purpose for which it was developed in the 1970s. That purpose was a response to and a recognition of the need to have a specialised family court to deal with issues of family separation, particularly with regard to the interests of children but also to the interests of parties, in a situation where a marriage irreconcilably breaks down and where they have to go to court. And let's not forget that not everyone ends up in the Family Court; it's a small number of cases overall that end up in the Family Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the history of the Family Court and the intent of the Family Court, I believe, are worth noting. But they are not only worth noting; they are worth saving. Absolutely they are worth saving. The expectation of a family law system to deliver the outcomes that the Whitlam government had as a vision of this specialist family law court, I believe, need to be reaffirmed and recommitted to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Effectively, however, this legislation does away with the family law court altogether. It does away with the specialised court for family law matters. It really is the culmination of successive years of decimation of the Australian family law system. Over the last seven years, the system has been undermined by absolute neglect: neglect by a government that was led by Tony Abbott, neglect by a government that was led by Malcolm Turnbull and now neglect by a government currently led by this Prime Minister. And the response that we've got from this government is to simply introduce legislation to do away with the Family Court altogether, merging it with the Federal Circuit Court. It is a response that, as previous members from this side have pointed out, is completely unsupported by the empirical evidence, by any of the expert organisations in the field or, indeed, by people who are going through the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the submissions that the joint select committee on family law has looked at, none of them have said, 'Abolish the Family Court.' It is not mentioned once in the interim report from this committee, and it has not been mentioned in various reports and various reviews of the family law system. Even the suggestion of abolishing the Family Court is not one that has come from within the sector, it is not one that has come from the people who have experience with the Family Court and it is not even one that has come from any government or parliamentary inquiry into the Family Court. It appears that it is merely a figment of this Attorney-General's imagination and an outcome this Attorney-General seems intent on achieving, and he's on his own. Nobody out there—none of the organisations, nobody involved in the Family Court system—is backing that outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family law system over the last seven years has completely been decimated by this government. There are ways to fix it, but this is not the way to fix it. Here is what this bill does: it doesn't fix the huge workloads that judges have. It doesn't fix the desperate need for more resources. It doesn't fix any of the issues that have been outlined in the interim report from the joint select committee on Australian family law. It doesn't fix any of those. What it does do, effectively, is abolish the standalone specialist Family Court as we know it, collapsing it into another court that is already one of the busiest, most under-resourced and overburdened courts: the Federal Circuit Court. In doing so, it harms vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The families that end up at the family law court—I'll tell us this from experience—didn't get there because we managed to work things out amicably and figure it out amongst ourselves. We got there because of particular circumstances. In many cases, domestic violence is involved. I've always been in awe of people who can end a relationship and remain friends—those people that end up going to each other's wedding and doing all of that. I've never been one of those people. And let me tell you, when a family ends up in the family law court, it's because they have reached a stage where every form of mediation has broken down and they are at an acute stage of needing that assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The supposed merger that will ultimately lead to the abolishment of the family law court will also result in increased cost, time and stress for families and for children. It will place further stress on Federal Circuit Court judges, who are already struggling under humongous workloads. It will fail to alleviate fundamental problems plaguing the family law system. Speakers before me on this side, as well as the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs, have very clearly stated what those problems are, and they very clearly come down to one issue: the issue of resourcing. Overburdened judges with huge case loads resulting in incredibly long waiting times are the heart of the problem. Instead of addressing that problem, the Attorney-General proposes instead to do away with the court altogether. It's not rocket science here—problem, solution. Finally, one of the things that this bill does in proposing a merger is fail to address the risk of family violence for any of the families that fall through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council has developed a very comprehensive briefing note, and I note that members before me have referred to this briefing note. They are very much opposed to the merger of the Family Court, but they're not alone. In fact, there are more than 110 stakeholders who oppose this merger for the various reasons that I've just outlined. When you have 110 different stakeholders who work in the system—who intimately know the system, who work with clients, who work with families, who work with victims of family violence—say that they oppose a merger, they oppose this bill and they oppose this move by the Attorney-General, why on earth would you persist?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the jobs that we have here is to listen—to listen to people, to listen to experts, to take the advice and to listen to what Australians want—and not to thumb our noses at the experts and thumb our noses at the stakeholders and say: 'No, no, I'm sorry. I know better.' I'm sorry, the Attorney-General does not know better than the Law Council and 110 other stakeholders, who have very clearly articulated not that they oppose this bill for no reason but that they oppose this bill for this reason: because it will not deliver the kind of reform that is needed to make the Australian family law system workable. What it will do is exacerbate already trying and stressful conditions for families by merging the court into the Federal Circuit Court, where judges there are already dealing with astronomical case loads and astronomical workloads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to speak much more about this, because I know that there are many more of my colleagues on this side who want to speak about this matter and why we, along with 110 other stakeholders, oppose this bill, but I point out the stark contrast between the number of people on the Labor side who are standing up to speak on this bill, standing up as a voice for their communities, standing up as a voice for the families and the children and the predominantly women escaping domestic and family violence who will be impacted by this bill, and compare that number to the meagre number of—what was it?—two speakers from the government side. There are two speakers on this bill from the government side. I think that speaks volumes. I think that says a lot about just how much this government is willing to listen to experts and willing to listen to those people who are impacted by the changes proposed by this arrogant Attorney-General who refuses to listen to advice, refuses to heed the evidence and is just following his own whim and his own outcome for a sector that he obviously knows very little about.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I rise with many of my colleagues to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. I think what this government is proposing through this legislation is the most significant change to the Family Court system since it was first established in 1975. For this reason, this legislation needs to be very carefully considered and carefully thought out. I think this move by the Attorney-General is ideological. I think it's been poorly thought out. I think it's an act of bastardry, and I'm totally opposed to it. I have always believed in science and evidence, and listening to the experts, and I think this Attorney-General has done exactly the opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, which are almost 500 pages in length and make amendments to countless other bills, will not, as far as I can see, improve the family law system, and in fact will very likely make things worse. I say that with some experience. I consider myself a stakeholder in this argument. In my 40 years as a paediatrician, I have had a lot of involvement with families and indeed with the Family Court system. What I have learnt is that families are incredibly complex. In dealing with families, particularly within the legal system, one needs to listen to the experts, and that is exactly what this government has not done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last parliament and in this parliament I have been a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. I had the opportunity in the last parliament to take part in a very extensive inquiry into the Family Court system in Australia that considered many aspects of the family law system as well as the Family Court system. As part of this inquiry, the standing committee held a number of hearings all over Australia. We spoke to countless stakeholders. I must say, some of the evidence that we were given was incredibly harrowing. We visited different courts across the land. Our committee, through its investigations, uncovered some truly disturbing aspects of our judicial system, and found that our legal system in terms of the Family Court system is definitely in need of reform and is definitely in need of proper funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews, that Labor wants to ensure that this legislation is carefully considered and looked over with a fine toothcomb because of the implications. These bills put forth by the government seek to combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one court, establishing the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. This effort to streamline and further compact our justice system brings the two courts into a single entity, having both covered under one umbrella. This means the two currently separate entities will be given a single chief justice and deputy chief justice, a single set of rules and a single point of entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we did learn in our inquiry is that the Family Court system, the family law system and dealing with families require experts in the field. Unfortunately, this legislation ignores that. The two amalgamated entities will undertake the same roles and functions as they currently do, but the Attorney-General has expressed an intention not to appoint new judges to the FCFC division as they retire. This is the division that, under this legislation, will replace the existing Family Court. What this means, in not so many words, is that this legislation will amount to a gradual abolition of the Family Court over time and a gradual abolition of any concept of expertise in dealing with Family Court matters. These bills will result in the work of the Family Court being absorbed into the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government should come clean and own up to what it is doing here. Through these bills, the government is trying to abolish the Family Court—one of the great legacies of the Whitlam government. When this legislation was first brought before the House some years ago, it appeared as though the government was trying to do this under a cloak of secrecy. Disgracefully, it appears as though those opposite haven't even bothered to consult with the families currently in the system or the experts dealing with family law. They are seeking to get rid of the Family Court and haven't bothered to consider the families who have used it in the past and are using it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My role on the previously mentioned standing committee, my role as a local MP working with local constituents and my experience as a paediatrician have collectively shown me that our legal system is definitely in need of reform. It is undeniable that the Family Court presently is in need of increased funding and significant changes. We've heard repeatedly that issues such as backlogs and unacceptable delays in the court system increase the risk of family violence to children and predominantly to mothers caught up in the system. The reality is that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government is at least partly to blame for this by underfunding and not understanding the role of the Family Court. You won't hear those opposite admitting to this truth but all the experts say this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The supreme peak body of the legal system in Australia, the Law Council, is totally opposed to this amalgamation. The government has not funded the court appropriately and the backlogs have increased, and their failure to adequately fund legal assistance services and their failure to adequately supervise and understand the role, for example, of court appointed children's solicitors had led to multiple problems and some disastrous outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has botched all due process in this legislation. They've failed to consult the broader community. They've failed to give time to groups of experts presenting to the government and explaining their recommendations. They have led to, I feel, a really retrograde step in the family law system. It's worth noting that the inquiry of which I was a part in the last parliament made 33 recommendations for the government to improve our family law system. It's worth noting that not one of those 33 recommendations has been accepted by the government. Not one of those recommendations talked about amalgamating the Family Court into the Federal Circuit Court. The government has not adequately explained their reasons for ignoring those recommendations. The government has failed to act on a vast number of recommendations that would improve the system and make better outcomes for families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not simple. We admit that. We understand that. This legislation is somehow being presented as a way of simplifying a system that is, of course, complex because of the very nature of families. As I've mentioned, I've been dealing with families all my working life, and families are complex. They're not easy to deal with sometimes. There's often conflict when families break down, and that conflict can lead to some poor outcomes. What we need to do is listen to the experts as much as we have done in the pandemic—Australia's had a good response to the pandemic because we've listened to the experts. The family law system is the same. We should listen to the experts and do what they suggest is best for the family law system in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the present time, we know, the majority of cases are being heard in the Federal Circuit Court. All the evidence that we've obtained indicated it's far better if the court has expert judges, expert family assessors, expert solicitors and expert court attendants that have learnt to deal with family law on an ongoing basis. What the current Attorney-General is agreeing to do with this legislation is hand over all legal matters pertaining to family law to the generalist Federal Circuit Court. All the available evidence suggests this will lead to worse outcomes, not better outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many matters that are presently handled in the Federal Circuit Court are those cases which are very complex and are therefore typically dealt with in the Family Court. This court is appropriately presided over by personnel who are equipped to deal with complex Family Court matters—they are specialist judges with the appropriate level of expertise required to hear such cases. It's because of the complex nature of these select cases that matters that are referred to the Family Court can take long time to resolve. The specialist skill and detailed consideration that is required to hear such cases, often involving children, is no reason to simply get rid of the Family Court altogether. Here the government appears unwilling to acknowledge and accept the fact that specialist judges should be required to consider complex family law cases in detail. I would say, as a paediatrician, it's also very important that specialist children's court appointed solicitors are properly trained in family law and are properly trained in their responsibilities to deal with the wishes, wants and needs of the children involved in family law. I'm very worried about what will happen to the children's interests in these situations if the matters are all heard by a generalist Federal Circuit Court. It appears to be mere semantics to the government, however. With a swipe of a pen, they can approve the abolition of a crucial, established and well-regarded court system with its institutional knowledge and capabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just go back very briefly to the government's failure to undertake the appropriate level of consultation. This legislation, as I've mentioned, is very significant and a major change. The Liberal-National government should have at least attempted to get some input from the wider community and relevant stakeholders. They have handled this whole debate and the development of their legislation very poorly. I can only feel that this is ideological. They have not bothered to pretend to engage with the people and groups that are in the family law system every day. They've neglected the family groups, the registrars, the legal assistance services, the lawyers and the judges. They didn't want any oversight, they didn't want to have to consult and they certainly didn't want any scrutiny. This is evident through their ill-conceived attempts to place restrictions on the time available to make submissions on these matters, which they initially wanted to be over and done with in just three weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are firmly in favour of adequate consultation, especially on such significant matters, and I think anyone involved in the Family Court would understand this and agree with it. The issues that are presently plaguing our judicial system should be addressed, but the government cannot hope to do this without reaching out to stakeholders. Instead they are merely abolishing the Family Court. This is a tragedy that is evolving. It is a shame. It is ideological. It is something that we should all be ashamed of. I'm firmly of the opinion that all stakeholders, whether they're in favour of the changes or not, should get the opportunity to have their say on these vitally important matters. To me, the government's failure here demonstrates their laziness and their ideology. Rather than actively engaging with the broader community, hearing people's experiences in the family courts and having appropriate discussions with the experts, they originally sought to rush this legislation through. Rather than actually trying to solve the underlying problems, the government appeared to be attempting to brush the issues under the carpet and hoping they would go away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General and his out-of-touch government can pretend all they like that adequate consultation has been undertaken, but the evidence certainly says otherwise, as do the expert groups. This is complex legislation that takes around 500 pages to outline, with amendments to 120 other acts, and is effectively axing an essential institution, yet it seems as though this government thinks it's okay to consult with just two people. That's right: it appears as though the government's original consultations were limited merely to the Chief Justice of the Family Court and the Chief Justice of the Federal Circuit Court. This style of government is like a toddler having a temper tantrum. As a paediatrician, I have witnessed many of those, but this one takes the cake. Make no mistake about it: that is what the government is doing here. Rather than dealing with the issues facing the Family Court, they've just suggested wiping it. In an ideological, haphazard manner, they choose simply to close the whole institution down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already mentioned that as a member of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs I was part of an inquiry that looked into the family law courts. This inquiry was eye-opening and reinforced what I believed, and it's an absolute tragedy that the government ignored it. I've had a great deal of exposure to the legal system—the Family Court system in particular—and I would not deny that the issues are very complex. The inquiry undertaken by the standing committee uncovered a number of problems associated with the legal system and, indeed, with the Family Court, but our recommendations would have improved it markedly. The inquiry proved that the difficulties facing many Australian families are due to underresourcing. This government has got this bill wrong from the start to the finish. They should do the right thing now and listen to those with everyday experiences in the family law system before they inevitably make matters worse through such a poor approach to addressing this crisis.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I'm happy to speak today on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. Two years ago almost to the day, I spoke on legislation introduced into the 45th Parliament that was broadly the same as the two bills currently before the House. Two years ago Labor didn't support these bills, and Labor still doesn't support these bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what's changed in the last two years? For one, the Australian Law Reform Commission has delivered its comprehensive review into the family law system. When the ALRC review was commissioned by the Attorney-General at the time, George Brandis, he described the review as 'the first comprehensive review of the family law system since the commencement of the Family Law Act in 1976'. Did the ALRC review recommend merging the courts, as these bills intend? No. The ALRC didn't recommend anything remotely like the reform that these bills will implement if they are passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I last spoke on these bills, the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System was appointed and asked to inquire and report on a wide range of issues relating to the family law system in Australia. I'm a member of that committee very ably chaired by the member for Menzies, the previous Deputy Speaker. Has the committee tabled a final report? No. The committee did table an interim report, and that majority interim report contained no recommendations. Labor members of that committee tabled a dissenting report, which did make recommendations. One of those recommendations was to not proceed with the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill. Labor members made that recommendation because of evidence heard by the committee about the dangers of proceeding with this very reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the witnesses who gave evidence to the committee about this proposed reform by the Attorney-General was former Chief Justice the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Court is likely to undermine the integrity of the Family Court and lead to undesirable outcomes for the parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General won't wait for the final recommendations of the joint select committee. He won't wait for the evidence given to that committee about the merger to be considered and recommendations made. He is charging ahead with his ill-conceived plan to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court of Australia is one of the great legacies of Gough Whitlam. The establishment of a specialist court whose sole purpose is to hear family law matters was a distinguishing feature of those groundbreaking reforms in 1975. In 1974 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs said the Family Court would be essential to give substance to key aspects of the Family Law Act. Anyone who spends time in family courts will quickly realise that, by necessity, those courts function quite differently from other general law courts. The matters dealt with in the family courts are unique to their jurisdiction. They make decisions based on the law but, often, getting to that determination involves a delicate analysis of facts and emotions and, in most cases, other complexities like family violence, mental health issues and drug and alcohol issues. It is quite different from every other area of the law. It is why many lawyers choose to practise exclusively in family law or don't practise in that area at all. It is an area of law that doesn't suit everyone. It is a specialist area of the law that needs a specialist court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Federal Circuit Court is a generalist court. It hears the less complex family law matters, if there is such a thing, but it also hears a great many migration matters and many general federal law matters. In the last year the Federal Circuit Court of Australia has had 6,555 applications filed in migration law and 3,778 applications filed in general federal law. The most recent annual report of the Federal Circuit Court says there is a 'growing number of applications in areas of general federal law' including 'an increased number of applications filed in the fair work jurisdiction' and a 'sharp increase in migration filings', which the report says is a 'pressing issue for the court'. The annual report goes on to warn about the increased filings in migration law. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Filings continue to grow at an unprecedented rate and this growth is placing increasing pressure on judicial resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet these bills will effectively abolish the standalone specialist Family Court and squash it into an already overstretched and under-resourced generalist court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not reform. This is sabotage. It is so absurd that yesterday afternoon there was a joint media release issued from the most respected legal bodies in Australia, including the Law Council of Australia, Community Legal Centres Australia, who were at the frontline, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Women's Legal Services Australia along with the first Chief Justice of the Family Court and the second Chief Justice of the Family Court. The media release was scathing about this proposed reform from the Attorney-General. Former Chief Justice the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC said this in the media release:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Chief Justice the Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO RFD QC had this to say about the reforms in these bills:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is unbelievable that Government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services say this bill will 'disproportionately impact the most vulnerable, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support'. So these bills are friendless. They're as lonely as a broken heart. They're like the last Tasmanian tiger, Benjamin. Remember that footage of him walking around a cage in the Hobart Zoo? The last thylacine—that's what these bills are. They're completely friendless. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is the Attorney-General so intent on pushing this reform through? That's a very good question. His media release, just 10 days ago, said the legislation would create one set of forms; one set of procedures, rules and practice management styles; and a single entry point. Let's just take these one at a time. The current Chief Justice, in his year in review contained in the recent Family Court of Australia annual report, details some projects currently being undertaken by the court itself—ones that don't require legislation. One of these initiatives is the harmonisation of the notice of risk and registrar delegations. The Chief Justice says this initiative is 'a precursor to formal rules harmonisation', which I will get to in a minute. The courts themselves have already redesigned each of the forms used for risk notification into a comprehensive notice to be called the 'notice of child abuse, family violence or risk'. It will be mandatory to file this notice with every initiating application response and application for consent orders seeking orders under part VII of the Family Law Act. The application forms in both courts are currently identical. There is a box at the top for you to tick which court you are filing the application in. That's the only difference. This bill is not needed to harmonise the forms of both courts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason the Attorney-General has given—to create one set of procedures, rules and practice management styles—has already been addressed by the courts themselves. The Chief Justice, in his annual report, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second area being harmonised and expanded as a priority is the rules that delegate judicial power to registrars in the family law jurisdiction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't get me wrong—registrars do great work and let judges get on with their important job. The Chief Justice goes on to say this about the initiative: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will allow registrars … to provide greater support to judges by assisting with case management work and free up judicial time so that judges can focus on determining the most complex matters and hearing trials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a sensible reform—one that I support—but one that does not require the passing of this legislation. The Chief Justice also details an initiative to reconcile case management procedures in family law across the two courts. In January, the Chief Justice issued the first joint practice direction, 'Core Principles in the Case Management of Family Law Matters'. That practice direction, which the courts and their users are required to adhere to right now, did not then and does not now require the passing of these bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chief Justice also shared in the annual report the work of the joint rules harmonisation working group, which has been progressing the harmonisation of the Family Court rules and the Federal Circuit Court rules over the past 12 months. The working group's efforts have produced a complete draft of the harmonised rules, which has already been distributed to all judges for consultation and will then be distributed to the profession and other stakeholders for external consultation in the second half of 2020—which, according to my watch, is about now. That's how far along this process that will result in one set of rules over both courts is. And, I stress, this did not require the passing of these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other point the Attorney-General made in his press release was that advocacy for the need for these bills was for a single point of entry. As I've said previously, the application process for filing in either the Family Court or the Federal Circuit Court requires the same form, and the applicant simply ticks a box as to which court they're filing in. I would suggest, after speaking with practitioners, that in most cases this is actually done by guesswork. Matters are routinely moved between both courts. For instance, if an application is filed in the Federal Circuit Court but is actually complex, it will then be moved up to the Family Court. A single point of entry where the registry determines which court the application should be filed in makes sense, but it doesn't require the merging of the two courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So far, out of the Attorney-General's shopping list of reasons why these bills need to be passed, none require the courts to merge or this legislation to be passed. The Attorney-General claims that 8,000 additional cases could be resolved each year—a noble aim—as a result of efficiencies delivered through the restructure. This reference is from the desktop review conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers back in 2018. We know a couple of things about that PwC review. We know it was conducted over a period of six weeks, it didn't consider detailed or broader reform opportunities and it did not consider revised budgetary allocations or reform opportunities within general law. One of the partners of PwC gave evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and said about their recommendation for reform:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we recommended in the report that the potential impacts of all opportunities identified be explored further to fully understand their impacts, including through further data capture and analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The partner also told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our focus of the report was very clearly on operational data; it didn't consider detailed reform opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Where there is likely a divergence in operational changes proposed by this Review and subsequently by the ALRC, advice should be sought from court stakeholders to understand where and how opportunities could be implemented in practice and which would bring about the greatest positive outcomes. Assessment of those opportunities, informed by detailed analysis, should underpin decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the ALRC did not recommend the merging of the two courts. The PwC report does not provide any credible economic foundation for the merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been 67 inquiries and reports into the family law system since 1974. None of those 67—not one—has recommended the reform contained in these bills. There have been 67 inquiries, reviews and academic studies and none have recommended the reforms that Attorney-General Porter is attempting to inflict on Australia's Family Court system with these bills. There's a reason none of those 67 reports have recommended this reform. It is because it is bad policy. We know that. Lawyers know that. Frontline legal services know that. Former judges know that. And families using the courts will find that out very quickly if these reforms are implemented. Someone who is accessing the courts regularly for her clients, Ms K, a family lawyer with a remote practice based in, let's say, South-East Queensland, has told me: 'The ongoing delivery of specialist services to children and families requires a specialist court, and that we already have.' She's not alone in that opinion. Former chief justices, the Law Council of Australia, National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, Community Legal Centres of Australia, Women's Legal Services Australia and 110 stakeholders have all publicly called on this parliament to vote against these merger bills. They say that the passing of these bills will increase costs, increase delay and increase stress for families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills should be ripped up and a proper process of reform should commence, one in which stakeholders who know the courts best should be consulted. Credible evidence should be assessed and proper reform designed for these important courts and the families who rely on them. Perhaps waiting for the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System, chaired by the member for Menzies, would be a good start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do not recommend supporting this fundamentally flawed legislation, but I do support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Isaacs.</span>

These bills seek to unify the administrative structure of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to create a Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia comprising Division 1, which would be a continuation of the Family Court, and Division 2, which would be a continuation of the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said about this legislation, and there's nothing particularly good that can be said about this legislation. It's a merger of two overstretched courts without substantial additional resources to support them. It can't even be described as a bandaid solution because I don't think it even counts as a bandaid. I strongly oppose this merger. The courts are overrun, and judges are overwhelmed. Many are taking mental health leave and some are physically collapsing. Those who leave are often not replaced. We have parties who are distressed and who are attending the courts to seek an early resolution of issues that go to the heart of their sense of self, of their family unit, of their relationship with their children or of their ability to house themselves and meet their bills, and they're often told they have to wait months to get before a judicial officer. Instead of responding to the experts and implementing some changes and amendments that would actually help the system, this legislation really is not going to address any of that. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee supported the implementation of this bill and, in response to that—that was a highly bipartisan approach—the President of the Law Council of Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report on the merger by Government Senators is entirely unsatisfactory because it does not engage in any meaningful way with concerns raised by more than 110 stakeholders who work in the family law system and witness daily, the impacts on children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family law and legal community more broadly are united in their doubt that these changes will achieve their stated objective. The Attorney-General's Department explained that the legislation's primary purpose is to improve justice outcomes for Australian families and make the federal law court simpler and easier for families to access. But the Law Council, the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, the Queensland Law Society, the Community and Public Sector Union, Community Legal Centres Australia and the New South Wales Bar Association, amongst so many others, questioned whether these bills would achieve these objectives. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services instead indicated the bills would not address the problems of delays and inefficiencies in the family law system and should be rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument has been mostly based, it appears, on a six-week desktop review of potential efficiencies conducted by PwC. Is this really what it's come down to—potential efficiencies that will impact the lives of so many people that have to engage with the family law system? They're distressed. Their emotional distress is being brought down to 'potential efficiencies' by some pen-pushers at PwC. In 2018, the authors of the report appeared before the Senate committee, and their claimed deficiencies were absolutely dismantled by the Senate committee questions. Even the authors of the report ultimately walked away from the numbers. The desktop review lasted only six weeks. It didn't interview any lawyers or families with experience of the family court system, and the headline efficiencies are not supported by evidence and did not result from meaningful engagement with those who know and use the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle of a single point of entry is something that is worthy of discussion, but many have argued that that's not necessarily what's going to be achieved with this bill. And, if the price of a single point of entry is losing the specialisation of the Family Court, that is absolutely the wrong direction. The court's annual report shows that the current caseload is unbelievably stretched. I must say that, before joining this place, as a family law barrister, I experienced firsthand that caseload. I know what it's like to turn up to court with a client and wait for hours, and have a judge, completely overwhelmed by their caseload and the numbers of files before them, simply tell clients that they're very sorry, but they will have to come back, often in two to three months time, with their issues completely unresolved. There was additional funding provided in this year's budget, but the funding won't translate into a meaningful reduction in the strain on the system unless we make meaningful amendments to the system. And, in fact, these bills will exacerbate the problem. According to the Family Court's 2019-20 annual report, 21,054 applications were filed in 2019-20, which was the highest number of filings in five years. The Family Court's annual report confirmed that there continues to be a backlog of more than a year's worth of cases, with more final orders applications pending at the close of this year than were finalised within the financial year. The wait is getting longer. The Federal Circuit Court disposed of 62 per cent of final order applications within 12 months, falling significantly short of its target of 90 per cent, for the second year in a row. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court warned that the impacts of COVID-19 will continue to be felt by the system, litigants and judges in the year to come. Hearings that were scheduled months in advance to occur in 2020 are now being cancelled by email and rescheduled, with some final hearing dates now not being available until 2022. Just stop for a moment and think about that: a party going to court to assist with resolving an incredibly sensitive issue is being told they will wait two more years before even getting a chance to argue their case. Proceeding with the amended merger bill at a time when the Federal Circuit Court is already struggling due to chronic under-resourcing and underfunding to manage its family law load, alongside a crushing and growing migration workload, is reckless, and it will put both litigants and judges at significant risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission <span style="font-style:italic;">2020 Report on government services</span> revealed that, between 2012 and the close of 2019, the backlog of all pending non-appeal applications in the Family Court grew by 34 per cent, while the backlog of all pending applications in the Federal Circuit Court grew by 63 per cent. The Law Council has argued that, while the increased legal assistance funding provided by the National Legal Assistance Partnership announced in June this year is certainly welcome, the funding contained in this year's budget is insufficient to address the significant unmet need in the system and the courts, and a one-off injection cannot rectify a decade of chronic under-resourcing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be clear what COVID-19 has done to this system. The number of urgent applications filed over four weeks in March and April alone increased by 39 per cent in the Family Court and 23 per cent in the Federal Circuit Court. The courts told the merger inquiry hearing on 6 November that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent family law application filing had increased by 142 per cent in the Family Court and 63 per cent in the Federal Circuit Court. As of 6 November 2020, two in three Federal Circuit Court judges have more than 300 matters on their dockets, 27 judges have more than 400 cases on their dockets and five judges have more than 500. One judge has 659 cases. In the Family Court, two-thirds of judges have more than 300 cases on their dockets and five judges have more than 500 cases. To put this into perspective, the 2017 House inquiry into the better family law system recommended reducing docket sizes to something like 100 cases per judge to significantly reduce delays. This means we need a significant increase in the number of judicial appointments. What we really need the government to do is increase the number of appointments—the number of judge positions available. It's not about just filling vacancies, because we know the existing number of positions is inadequate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first and former chief judge of the Family Court, the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC, warned:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the proposed merger of the Family Court and the Federal Court is likely to undermine the integrity of the Family Court and lead to undesirable outcomes for the parties. It is inconsistent with the original aims of the Family Court, which was established as a specialist Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With increasing numbers of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised, there is an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who do not exercise any unrelated jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second and former chief justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson AO, RFD, QC, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the passage of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) and the setting up of the Family Court was some of the most significant social legislation ever to be passed by the Federal Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said, 'We should be proud of that, instead of trying to dismantle it.' He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What those proposing this merger do not seem to understand is that family law is complex and nuanced, and it is not to be judged by the output by numbers of cases as if the Courts are sausage machines. Throughput is important, but so is the quality of the decisions made. Cases can be extremely complex and require specialist knowledge of the type that has always been available in the Family Court, which has provided leadership in the proper interpretation and principles to be applied by other courts with family law jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're actually the envy of so many other countries. The Family Court is the court that's been envied throughout the common law world, and its judgements have often been cited with approval by the courts of many other countries, such as New Zealand, the UK, Canada, the USA and others. So its significance as the only specialist family court set up as a superior court of record, particularly that of its appeal division, cannot be overemphasised. The former justices have joined more than 110 stakeholders on the front line, urging the parliament to vote against the merger bill, scrap it, go back and come back with some good legislation. This merger will only increase costs, delay and stress for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court are really distressing places. I've appeared as a counsel for both mothers and fathers. I can't begin to convey the distress parties experience at being told that it will take months from filing to get before a judge for a decision. The practical aspect of this means the party might go without contact with their child for an extended period of time until allegations can be properly heard and assessed. It means the party may remain in serious financial difficulty and may even find themselves homeless until their case can properly be assessed. That's not acceptable, and this bill doesn't remedy that at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues impact every electorate. In Warringah we are the same. The problems of the family law system reach everywhere. A domestic violence pop-up shelter was set up in March with the onset of COVID-19. That shelter is housing 70 women and children who would otherwise be suffering or homeless. The Family Court and Federal Circuit Court are dealing with complex issues and they require the support of more specialised counselling services and also of specialised courts to deal with the issues. The Family Court is the only court that can support such complexity, and it needs to be staffed with specialists qualified to deal with the issues at the highest possible standard of care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Law Reform Commission in May 2017 made a number of recommendations. The report was delivered on March 2019 and included 60 recommendations which would go a long way towards addressing the reform required in the family law system. Yet the government has still not responded to the ALRC recommendations that would improve the family law system. This merger was outside the scope of the inquiry, but we still have silence from the government on the ALRC recommendations. That's not acceptable. During the family law inquiry that I have been part of this year, we've heard from so many parties who have been let down by the system. If we genuinely want to address the problems, we must start with the recommendations of the ALRC. The Law Council president, Pauline Wright, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No amendment to the bill can cure what remains a flawed and dangerous proposal without evidentiary foundation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt we need reform in the family law system, but the merger is the wrong move. Lawyers, judges and families are united in their opposition. We need to help the courts better service distressed families, we need specialisation of professionals and we need to make sure that it is properly resourced and funded. We need more legal aid in the system so both parties to disputes can have access to assistance. We need more counselling for men and women. We need more funding for specialist judges and experts. So I urge the government: Please, this is a system that is a highly distressing court system. Everyday Australians are impacted by what happens in the family law system, and it actually needs proper structural assistance, not a merger and a shortcut.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  I'm please to follow the member for Warringah, who has practised in this area and has very eloquently laid out not only the stresses on the family court system but the problems with this bill. Ultimately, what we should start from is what is going to protect children and families best, and the strongest protection for children, for families and for survivors of family and domestic violence is to maintain and strengthen a standalone specialist family law court involving a holistic specialist system of collaborative, culturally safe, co-located services and resources. This was the intention when the Family Court was created. The Family Court model is unique and, as we have heard from previous speakers, has been held up as a model of best practice internationally. Others look to the family court system that we have. Since being established some 45 years ago, by the Whitlam government, the Family Court of Australia has operated as the standalone specialist court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the radical and misconceived reforms in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 would effectively put an end to that. Instead of working to fix the family law system, the government remains determined to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that will make a bad situation worse for Australian families, including vulnerable children. The government's deeply flawed proposal is based on nothing more than a six-week desktop review performed by some consultants. The government's proposed abolition of the Family Court as a standalone specialist family court has been almost universally condemned, particularly by key stakeholders from NATSILS, the Law Council of Australia, the New South Wales Bar Association, women's legal services, community legal centres and advocates for the safety of women and children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What families need now and what they look to the parliament to provide is safety, security and as much certainty as possible during the pandemic period but also beyond. At the core of so many of the issues confronted by the system is a chronic and sustained lack of proper funding and resources for the Family Court as well as the Federal Circuit Court. This failure on the government's part includes a failure to appoint and maintain sufficient and appropriately experienced judicial officers and associated staff, and insufficient funding to maintain the counselling and assessment services previously provided by the courts. As a result, there are judges who have dockets—case loads—of over 600. That is a failure on the government's part, and the Family Court itself should not be punished for the government's failures. Failing to strengthen the system has produced unacceptable delays as well as costs that directly impact on the accessibility and quality of justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the merger proposal, the Family Court 2.0 model that's favoured by key stakeholders proposes a straightforward lift and shift of the Federal Circuit Court's family law jurisdiction and judges into a new lower division within a standalone specialist Family Court. Family Court judges would be in division 1 of the Family Court of Australia, and Federal Circuit Court judges who are hearing family law matters would move across to division 2 of the Family Court of Australia. This model has been in force for many years in the Attorney's own state of Western Australia, and this system was also recommended by the 2008 Semple report and has been endorsed by stakeholders including the Law Council of Australia, Women's Legal Services Australia and the former Chief Justice Elizabeth Evatt AC. Unlike the governments merger proposal, the Family Court 2.0 model would have the significant advantage of promoting safety for children and adults by preserving access to services of a specialist family court. An increase in specialisation in family law and family violence law will increase the safety of children and adult victims-survivors of family violence, and this is particularly the case for groups that are disproportionately impacted in the family law and family violence systems, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for increased and culturally safe specialisation of courts to improve decisions and outcomes for families is supported by the evidence of the many inquiries into the family law system. The point needs to be made and stressed that there is a remarkable lack of support and friends for this bill, in large part because it's not based on the evidence. It was based on a six-week desktop review to pursue ends that one can only think are ideological ends that the government already had. As a result, almost all of the submissions to the inquiry into this bill oppose it and propose alternatives such as the Family Court 2.0 system, which integrates both a judge level and a Circuit Court component. That kind of model would produce exactly what Australians clearly expect of their legal system: a single specialist family court to address the needs of the country's families within an integrated system of collaborative, culturally safe and responsive support services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The alarming prevalence of family violence in the system makes specialisation critical to promote safe engagement for survivors with the courts and our justice system from the time a matter is filed, through appropriate triage and active case management to expedited resolution, all the while providing culturally safe wraparound services. A specialist Family Court must not be destroyed based on a mirage that this will fix problems which, in reality, require more resources and holistic reform. So far, as I've said before, what we know is that failing to strengthen the system has produced unacceptable delays and costs that directly impact on the accessibility and quality of justice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 2020, the Australian government committed to increase funding of legal assistance services as part of the National Legal Assistance Partnership, but, whilst that funding is welcome and desperately needed, it is not sufficient to meet current need or to comprehensively address two decades of significant underfunding and cumulative shortfalls in funding from numerous governments. Increased ongoing and adequate funding through the National Legal Assistance Partnership must be a priority for the Australian government to ensure that the legal assistance sector can meet the demands placed on it in times of crisis and beyond.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the House that this bill should not pass, and the government should instead properly consider not only resourcing the existing Family Court but also better alternatives such as the Family Court 2.0 model that has been put forward and is preferred by stakeholders. The government should also commit to at least an additional $310 million a year in funding for legal assistance providers—as identified by the Law Council, to make up for the shortfall caused by successive cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, community legal centres, women's legal services and legal aid commissions. Substantial funding must also be made available to the social and support services that families and survivors of family and domestic violence require. Finally, and critically, the government must properly provide the required public money to allow the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court to appoint and maintain sufficient numbers of appropriately experienced judicial officers and other staff that they may require to provide sufficient culturally safe, wraparound and responsive support for parties before the court. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this bill has no support and obtained no support during the inquiry process because it is a deeply flawed bill that cannot be fixed by amendments. The proposal underpinning it—to abolish a specialist standalone family court—is fundamentally misconceived. The answer is to properly resource the Family Court that we've got and consider the alternatives, like the Family Court 2.0 model, that have been put forward. It will be devastating for thousands and thousands of families around this country if this bill passes and if the Family Court is abolished, as this government wants to do, based on no evidence at all—nothing more than an ideological bent that is going to hurt families and children.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I rise to express sincere concerns about this bill, which I intend to oppose. Subsuming our standalone specialist Family Court into one of the busiest court administrations in this nation will do more harm than good. Any reform should strengthen a system, not diminish specialisation, especially when that system is designed to support families and children through some of the most difficult times in their lives. Justice must be timely, and in the case of the Family Court the delays are well known. But justice is not and should not be obsessed with achieving speed and efficiency dividends. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will strip back tailored systems and corporate knowledge that have taken decades to develop—everything from specialist staff who can identify and intervene in family violence to tailored procedures for vulnerable children giving evidence as witnesses. It's no secret that the Family Court faces workload and resourcing challenges, but so does the Federal Circuit Court, which also struggles to manage a caseload of less complex family matters alongside numerous other areas of law, including migration, bankruptcy and workplace law. A pen stroke to merge the two does not solve either of these problems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this proposal was announced back in May 2018, a broad coalition of law councils, bar associations and community legal centres across the nation flatly opposed it, including the Hume Riverina Community Legal Service in my electorate of Indi, and the Victorian law council. Even after consultation and the committee process over in the Senate, this coalition of stakeholders still opposed these reforms. Why? Because there is no evidence base for it and because there are better ways to achieve progress that are not as blunt as this bill, such as the Family Court 2.0 model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an independent, I am committed to evaluating each and every bill that passes through this place on its individual merits. Among other questions I ask myself are these ones: does this bill have a robust evidence base? Is this bill founded on principles of good governance? Does it serve the people it's intended to serve? I am sorry to say that this bill fails to answer many of those questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposal has been pulled out of thin air following a six-week desktop review this government commissioned via a private consulting firm. Even the final report from that private consulting firm did not endorse this proposal. In 2019, the Australian Law Reform Commission completed a landmark report on the family law system which included 60 recommendations for reform. The ALRC consulted with hundreds of stakeholders and carefully considered the family law system in Australia and its future. Nowhere in that report is the notion of merging these two courts entertained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be doing all we can to respond to the family violence crisis in Australia. It's a well-known fact that the majority of matters lodged in family courts involve allegations of family violence. More than 30 per cent of people who seek help from community legal centres experience family violence. Dismantling our specialist Family Court model would be a retrograde step and put those at risk of family violence in greater peril.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family law system remains woefully underfunded. We should be investing in proper resourcing and reform that has vision, not trying to drag and drop our way out of this crisis. We should be investing in reforms like those recommended by the ALRC—which the government has been slow to respond to—such as simplifying children's orders, improving access to family counselling and consultants, and supporting wraparound family law pathway networks the build in community health and domestic violence services. That's what we should be doing. This is not a bill I can support. We must not destroy our specialist Family Court based on a false belief that a merger will fix it or, even worse, bury the challenges that confront it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LTU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:13</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019. I want to echo the words of my friend and colleague the member for Isaacs, who has outlined just how bad this bill is. Through this bill the government is seeking to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court. The Family Court of Australia is a proud Whitlam legacy. Like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia, from Medicare to our world-leading superannuation system to free legal assistance services for Australians in need, the Family Court of Australia is an institution that has served our nation admirably.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act 1975 instituted two major changes: it established the Family Court of Australia, a specialist multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes; and it instituted no-fault divorce. Thankfully, the Morrison government is not proposing to reinstitute fault based divorce, but what it is proposing to do is to undo the other of the major changes introduced by the Family Law Act, which was the establishment of the Family Court of Australia as a specialist superior court. This would be a profoundly retrograde step which would harm Australian families and, in particular, children at their time of greatest need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like thousands of other families, I myself have been through the trauma of divorce. I did so with four kids in tow, all enduring the pain of that process, and it is very painful for some of us, perhaps even for most of us. I can't tell you how I appreciated the knowledge and skill of the specialists in the Family Court, who saw through the posturing and bluster; who managed the insults and the accusations; who sidestepped the blaming and the shaming, the anger and the pleading; and were not fazed by tears, not to mention managing to forge and land a fair and reasonable legal outcome. So you see specialisation does not just mean specialist judges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitlam government's vision of a specialist Family Law Court was of a court with interrelated co-located services and resources. It was about creating an environment that would have regard to what Whitlam described as 'the human problems' of couples and families and not just their legal rights. And that was exactly my experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The realisation of that vision has never been more important, especially for vulnerable children and families, who need a family court system that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their particular needs and vulnerabilities. Everyone accepts that there are serious problems in the Family Court at present. The main cause of those problems, though, is not a mystery. As the Australian Law Reform Commission found, the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last seven years, the story of the Australian family law system has been a story of neglect, neglect and more neglect. Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges have not been replaced in a timely manner. Funding has not increased in response to increasing demand, and review after review, including many dozens of sensible and measured recommendations, has been ignored. The evidence from experts that this merger proposal will increase cost, increase time and increase stress for families and children and place further stress on Federal Circuit Court judges is particularly alarming. It makes a complete mockery of the government's claim that this bill will streamline services and make it easier for families going through this trauma.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee heard evidence the average number of cases across all Federal Circuit Court judges is 337 at present—I repeat, an average of 337 cases per judge. For contested family law matters in the Family Court, it is currently taking on average 18.6 months from the date a matter is filed to the date on which the trial commences. In the Federal Circuit Court the average is 17.5 months. In some cases it is taking over two years from the date of a judgement being reserved to the date on which the judgement is finally delivered. In some Federal Circuit Court and Family Court registries it's taking on average 12 months for court appointed family consultants to produce family reports. A family report is an absolutely critical document that provides an independent assessment of issues in a case. Those reports help judges to make life-changing decisions about arrangements for children, noting that the main focus of a family report is the best interests of the kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of delays are not merely statistics. In its landmark 2019 report on the family law system, which the government has so far ignored, the Australian Law Reform Commission referred to a number of concerns associated with the present delays in the Family Court system, including the potential for children and parents to spend long periods living in limbo waiting for trial; the safety risks to parties and children arising from delayed resolution of disputes that involve protective concerns, including contributing to homelessness; the scope for delay and uncertainty to exacerbate conflict; and the potential for clients to consent to outcomes that fall short of the security and protection a court order can provide. Instead of working to fix the family law system, the government remains determined to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that will make a bad situation worse for Australian families. You would expect that such a radical reform would be based on sound evidence and you would expect that the government would have consulted widely. It's not, and the government didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government claims that the proposed merger has been informed by independent reviews and inquiries over a decade. The Attorney-General's Department website lists five reports under the heading 'The evidence base for the reforms'. The only problem with that is that none of the reports listed on the website actually recommended these radical reforms—none! None of those reports even considered these reforms being proposed. In fact, the only one of the five reports that recommended restructuring the Family Court recommended an entirely different model which would have maintained a standalone specialist family law court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General and the Morrison government have ignored all of this. Instead, in their efforts to promote these bills, the Attorney-General continues to cite the findings of a six-week desktop review of data by two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Imagine that: making the biggest change to the Family Court system in over 40 years on the basis of a short desktop review by two accountants—a review, by the way, that has been widely panned and thoroughly discredited. The Attorney-General did not undertake any meaningful consultation in relation to his proposal to effectively abolish the Family Court. There was no meaningful consultation with the legal profession or with other family specialists like counsellors or child psychologists. There was no consultation with users of the Australian law system—Australian families. Other than with the Chief Justice, the government did not even consult with the judges of the Family Court. The arrogance of the government is breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's proposed abolition of the Family Court as a standalone specialist court is not merely friendless; it has been almost universally condemned. One hundred and ten stakeholders ranging from the Law Council of Australia to Women's Legal Services, Community Legal Centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, child protection advocates and disability services right across Australia have written to the Attorney-General asking him to abandon this proposal. They've been ignored. Those 110 individuals and organisations oppose this proposal because they believe that it will harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist family law assistance. They think these bills will increase, rather than decrease, cost, time and stress for families and children in the law system; place further stressors on the Federal Circuit Court judges, who are already struggling under unsafe, unsustainable and unconscionable workloads; and, importantly, fail to address any of the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of family violence survivors falling through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The president of the Law Council of Australia, Pauline Wright, has said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There must be an increase not a decrease in specialisation in family law and violence issues. This is critical for the safety of children and victims of family violence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services—which, I might say, are housed in my electorate—have said that the proposed merger:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">From our experience, as Aboriginal organisations, we say that mainstreaming does not achieve efficiency or better outcomes for our people and that specialisation in the law is important and it works. Our main call is for more specialisation and more resourcing into the cultural competence of the family court system. The introduction of specialist Aboriginal Courts in the family law system has seen an increase in Aboriginal participation. We implore the Parliament to do the right thing by our communities and reject this bill which does not address the root causes of these problems. We fear, in the middle of this global pandemic, the bill will exacerbate the issues that our communities are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in his smug arrogance, the Attorney-General has dismissed these concerns with a wave of his hand. I genuinely don't understand how anyone could support these bills. I don't understand what it seeks to achieve. It will hurt traumatised kids at a time when they need support. The Attorney-General should withdraw these bills and simply concentrate on fixing the family law courts.</span>

It's not thought through, it's not based upon evidence, it's not based upon any proper community consultation, it is, once again, an example of spin over substance from a government looking for a reason for its ongoing existence. The fact is that there are problems with the functioning of the family law system. This abolition of the Family Court of Australia, which is what it is, will do nothing to solve the problem—it will make it worse. It is regressive, it's not thought out and it's another example of a government that, in so many of its actions, has detrimental impacts on women in Australia in particular.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court of Australia is a proud Labor legacy. It was one of the reforms of the Whitlam Government that was so important. It was a reform of a system that seems archaic today—that families that had breakdowns had to provide some form of evidence in a way that was often humiliating—that exposed families to the sort of difficulties that added to the pain of family breakdowns. In particular, it was a reform that was aimed at looking after women in our society. It was one that was subject to considerable debate. Indeed, nearly half of the then House of Representatives participated in that debate. A total of 59 members spoke on the Family Law Bill 1974. That's because that was a time when both sides of parliament were engaged in reform. What we have today is a government that bowls up legislation without putting forward an argument for it and isn't even prepared to defend it. The speaking list today is an example of that, whereby the government seeks to abolish a fundamental part of our legal system without even presenting an argument—just a couple of speakers from government members; a token effort. It is a government that isn't even prepared to defend its legacy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act was important for two major changes. It instituted no-fault divorce as well as establishing the Family Court of Australia. Why did it do this? Because when it comes to this form of law, it does require that level of expertise, that knowledge, that comes from a specialist multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes. It was a process which created an institution—the Family Court of Australia—which has served Australia well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, what we have here is the product—after eight years and into its eighth year of neglect—of issues, of cuts, of a failure to appoint appropriate judicial members, of a failure to properly examine reform across the board. It is a story of neglect, neglect and more neglect—neglect by the Liberal government led by Tony Abbott, then neglect by the Liberal government led by Malcolm Turnbull and then neglect by the current Liberal government led by Scott Morrison. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the solution to the problem? 'We'll just abolish it. We'll just abolish the court.' It is quite extraordinary that they've come up with that. Of course, they will say that what they are doing is restructuring the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which, as we've seen, is dominated by the need to have spin out there. When the Prime Minister had to choose who would be with him during his period in quarantine, it wasn't the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It wasn't his chief of staff or his key economic adviser. It was his photographer, for staged shots in the Lodge. It said it all about the nature of this government. Today we saw that the hollowman has become a hologram, literally, in the parliament in the way that he deals with these issues. This isn't leadership. There's been no proper debate out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the members opposite: in your electorates, what process have you been through to consult your community on the Family Court being abolished—under the guise of an amalgamation, of course. What these bills will do is, effectively, abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court. Over 110 individuals and organisations, including family lawyers, former and current judges and child protection advocates from across Australia, have asked the Morrison government to abandon this proposal. But the Morrison government of course refuses to listen. Instead the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are arrogantly pursuing these harmful reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side do accept that there are serious problems of funding and other issues for the Family Court to deal with. The main cause of those problems isn't a mystery. There has been examination of it. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in its landmark report on the family law system, found that it has:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time when we were ahead of the world, and now, increasingly, we are falling behind. And this will just push us further behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as it has ignored the family law system, the Morrison government has ignored the commission's report. Despite handing down the biggest spending budget in Australian history and a record deficit the likes of which we have never seen—$1 trillion of debt—it refuses to provide the family law system with adequate resources. Because of the pressure that this creates in families, by definition, if they are going before a court undergoing some difficulties, these issues can be very difficult to deal with. What these short-sighted cuts do and what this miserly approach does is push the need for increased funding somewhere else—into, if things can't be resolved, health issues and into issues such as, particularly, the need for security and safety of women and children. It is a very short-sighted approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House don't say that the family law system doesn't need to change, but our priority is to put in place the right changes that will genuinely assist families in need. Men, women, children and families need that assistance. That's why we're opposing this legislation—because it is an example of a government that, by the time they get to the next election, will be struggling to find a reason for existence. There they've been for three terms, with no big economic reforms. They have managed to produce $1 trillion of debt, $100 billion in new spending and no reform as part of any of that—no economic reform whatsoever in the budget that we saw just one month ago, but no social policy reform of any substance either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House are proud of our record, when in government, of making reforms that make a difference to people's lives and social policy we can look towards, like paid parental leave that we did during our last time in office. Good social policy reform also has economic benefits, a bit like our childcare benefit that we announced as the centrepiece of our budget reply. This government, looking for a reason for existence, just comes up with cuts and short-sighted proposals that will drag Australia back, not move it forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this legislation is deserving of defeat in this chamber and that's why the government needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a policy that truly is in the interests of families. I support the amendment moved by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General and urge parliament to support that amendment and then oppose the legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on what can only be considered one of the most bizarre pieces of legislation that I've seen in my time in this House. In this merger the government should stand up and own what it's trying to do, not hide behind a cover. Come out and be upfront with the Australian people. The government wants to abolish the Family Court as a specialised and standalone court dealing with some of the most difficult and important matters for families going through times of trouble. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, I want to say no-one thinks that the Family Court is perfect. But this incompetent government response is to say, 'Let's just abolish it.' Rather than fix it, rather than listen to experts, rather than go out and consult with people and find out what the issues are and how to address them, the government says: 'We'll just abolish it. We'll just tuck it away.' That's not helpful to many people in the seat of McEwan who find themselves dealing with family law matters, particularly during a family breakdown. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law has changed significantly over the last few decades. In the past, in the pre-no-fault divorce days, a spouse had to show that the other party was at fault, to have a divorce issued. That meant proving adultery, desertion, habitual drunkenness, imprisonment or insanity, for example. Thankfully, because of the Whitlam government, those days are gone. I'm glad the Attorney-General has the good sense to reaffirm his commitment to no-fault divorce, which is an unusually rational decision from the embattled minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to undo much of the groundwork that supports the Australian justice system. When the Family Law Act was passed it represented one of the great legal achievements of Australia's recent history. The Family Court was everything that family law experts said was needed. It's an essential feature that deals with family law matters, particularly those that are fraught with emotion, hurt, outrage and even violence. But Prime Minister Whitlam wanted a court that could employ all means available to it—counselling services, psychologists, welfare support officers and legal advisers, things that help families feel supported during tough times. Specialisation is not just specialist judges. The Whitlam government's vision of a specialist family law court was of a court with interrelated services and, particularly, resources. It was about creating an environment that would have regard to what Whitlam described as the human problems of couples and families, not just their legal rights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that there are some people who feel the Family Court hasn't lived up to its potential. Whether dealing with custodial matters or issues of divorce, the court is not seen to be delivering the results the public expect of it. The government's only response to this is to abolish the court. That's not only short-sighted but cruel and completely conflicts with evidence given to the government. The problem is that, if the government cared about improving the lives of Australians appearing before the Family Court, they might have listened to the countless legal bodies and family councils that said a merger of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court was the wrong approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General did not undertake any meaningful consultation on his proposal to effectively remove the Family Court. He did not speak with families who have been through the courts; he did not speak with child psychologists; and, most importantly, he did not consult with the legal profession at large. If he had, he would have heard clearly from the 110 individuals and organisations that oppose this bill because they know that it will harm vulnerable children and families in need of specialist law and assistance. It will increase costs, time and stress for families in the family law system. It will place further stresses on the Federal Circuit Court judges who are already buckling under an obscene workload which gives rise to severe stress and mental and health struggles. And it fails to address any of the fundamental issues which people might have with the family law system. Both the first and the second chief justices of the Family Court have said that this proposed merger fails to understand that family law is complex and nuanced and that the quality of decisions will suffer if the merger goes ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with almost unanimous opposition to this proposed merger, we have to ask: what evidence are the government making their decision on? As it turns out, they are basing their decision not on any advice from legal professionals but on a six-week desktop review by two accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers—a desktop review to deliver the government the answer it wanted to its questions. So let's be straight. The government is overturning Australia's entire Family Court system because of the justification of two accountants in a six-week review, which, rightly, has been widely panned and totally discredited. It's so typical of the government: a private review of a public resource, with a meaningless report used as a slim and cynical justification to cut, merge or abolish systems. The arrogance of this government is breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we know there are problems with the family law courts at the moment, and the main cause of those problems is not a mystery. The Australian Law Reform Commission found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's actions are like poking holes in the bottom of a ship and then saying, 'Oh, why's it sinking?' Over the past seven years, the story of the Australian family law system has been one of neglect, neglect and more neglect: neglect by the Liberal government led by Tony Abbott; neglect by the Liberal government led by Malcolm Turnbull; and now, in the third stage, neglect by the current Liberal government, led by Scott Morrison. Family Court and Federal Circuit Court judges have not been replaced in a timely matter. Funding has not increased in response to increasing demand and review after review—including many dozens of sensible and measured recommendations that have all been ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of working to fix the family law system, the government remains determined to restructure the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court in a way that will make a bad situation worse for Australian families, including vulnerable children. The evidence from the experts is that this merger will increase costs, will increase time and will increase stress for families and children and place further stress on Federal Circuit Court judges. This is alarming. This merger will not lead to the just, quick and cheap resolution of family law disputes. Instead it's going to make matters worse for families like those living in McEwen who have been caught up in long-running, costly and emotionally devastating family law disputes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The under-resourcing of the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court systems has had severe consequences for the backlog. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which inquired into this bill, heard evidence that two Federal Circuit Court judges, one in the Brisbane registry and one in the Wollongong registry, had over 600 cases on their dockets—600 cases for each of those judges at the same time. Three other judges had between 500 and 600 cases, and 21 had between 400 and 500. At the moment, the average number of cases for Federal Circuit Court judges is 337. We just have to consider what that means per judge—the time and energy needed to get this done in a timely manner to help people who are in a vulnerable state. It lacks any logic that the government thinks a merger is going to assist this workload.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, contested family law matters in the family law court are currently taking, on average, 18½ months from the date the matter is filed to the date the trial commences. In the Federal Circuit Court the average is 17½ months. This is an outrage. It is something the government should have been working to fix rather than tearing down. But that is the hallmark of this government. Tearing down and stopping are their key mantras.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some cases it takes over two years from the date of the judgement being reserved to the date on which the judgement is finally delivered. This has serious consequences for all those involved in the family law system. It has consequences for the judges, who are buckling under the immense pressure to hear too many cases and produce too many judgements. I myself know that the workload that has been put on judges and magistrates across this nation is crippling them and impacting severely on their mental health. When looking at legislation like this we need to consider the emotional, mental and physical outcomes for judges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are consequences for the families before the court. They suffer from uncertainty and resentment over how long the process takes. It's cheap and easy to attack them, but the reality is that the reason we have problems and are going through this situation is that this government made a conscious decision not to fund the courts properly and give them the proper resources. This has done nothing but cause increased pain and heartache for families who are going through the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that this government's proposal will not fix the systemic problems that have occurred under its watch. We have a justice system that is crying out for help, resourcing, staffing and the support they need to do the work that everyone in this building finds so important. But what is the government's response? The government's response is simple: make it harder and more expensive for families, most of whom are already going through the worst period of their lives with a family breakdown and the problems that causes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is rotten legislation from a rotten government. We should not support this. Anyone on the government side with a conscience would definitely reconsider their position on this and advocate on behalf of Australian families who are going through a family breakdown. They would support them and give the courts the resources they need to do their job properly and efficiently. We should look after Australians, not leave them in limbo to get angry about decisions that are beyond their control. I urge government members to dig deep—somewhere they have a conscience—find their conscience and use it to oppose this legislation.</span>

Most Australians don't get injured at work. Most Australians don't have car accidents. Most Australians aren't sued as debtors. Most Australians as creditors don't sue other people. But Australians en masse—one in three marriages that break up, and in second and third marriages it's as high as 50 per cent and in de facto and common law arrangements it's even higher—are affected by what happens in our family law and child support systems. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 will impact upon them in a way other bills we debate in this chamber do not.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of this legislation displays once again the strong ideological position of the conservative parties in this country. There are some issues that really divide the major political parties. For decades the coalition opposed Medicare and they only reluctantly accepted it when Australians from Toombul to Toorak eventually accepted Medicare as socialised medicine in this country. Industrial relations remains a thorn for those opposite. Every time they get an opportunity, they will pass legislation that will impact upon the right of workers to organise. Another issue is superannuation. We saw that recently with the announcements. They've got legislated increases in the superannuation guarantee, but they've never seen a pause they didn't like with respect to the increase in the superannuation guarantee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another schism is the family law system. It wasn't that long ago that our grandparents and great-grandparents had to go to state courts and had to prove, blame, fault to get a divorce. In the 19th century, and even earlier, people didn't have a legal responsibility at law to provide for their children, and it took legislative intervention—for example, the poor laws in 1601 in England—for that to happen. It was only legislation to provide for ongoing child support and the Family Law Act which made it clear that parents have parental responsibility obligations to support their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act came in against much opposition from conservative forces in this country. Sure, in 1959, Sir Garfield Barwick, the then Attorney-General, brought forward the Matrimonial Causes Act to make this come under a federal jurisdiction. But there were still fault divorces. Private eyes and private investigators, when I was practising as a lawyer, still would say that that was one of their main sources of income. It took the foresight and the intelligence of then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and his minister Lionel Murphy to bring in the family law system against the objection of the conservative forces in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll speak on no-fault divorce. Divorce's only ground has been, since 1976 in this country, irretrievable breakdown of marriage evidenced by people living separately for a duration of 12 months, that being the test that the consortium vitae, the partnership of life between a man and a woman, had broken down. It took Labor governments—and, indeed, state governments—to extend the jurisdiction of the family law system to do things like bring in de facto relationships and same sex relationships and to extend the rights that you see in section 79(4) and section 75(2) of the Family Law Act for property settlement to cover other people. Ex-nuptial children and de facto relationship children were brought into the system so that family courts could make decisions in the best interests of children guided by the Family Law Act so that those children would not be neglected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The family law system is not perfect. I know it. I practised for nearly 25 years as a family lawyer. I was an accredited family law specialist since the mid-nineties and practised in the jurisdiction—everything from the Full Court of the Family Court to the High Court to the local Magistrates Court, where I was involved in domestic and family violence cases. I know the system is not perfect, but the coalition parties in this country in the last three terms have done everything they can to stymy the system. This legislation is about diminishing, dismantling and destroying the Family Court system in this country, and it will impact men, women and children adversely. They know it, but they can't take off their ideological blinkers. They just cannot do it. It's like superannuation, it's like Medicare and it's like industrial relations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court system in this country is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than in other countries, and it's better than it was before Labor won the election in 1972 and in 1974 and then brought in the legislation in 1975, which was promulgated and established in 1976. I regret seeing the wigs, the gowns and the robing. I recall that, when I first started practising as an articled law clerk, the judge sat there in a suit and a tie opposite us and that we sat there at tables. I liked the informal basis for that. I saw changes in years to come which meant a more formal structure. But also there was need to be flexible in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a situation where the most egregious domestic and family violence and child sexual abuse cases were dealt with in a Magellan list. We saw the improvements there as a result of that. We saw, for example, improvements in dealing with the system by establishing a Federal Magistrates Court, which has become the Federal Circuit Court. We saw an expansion of that jurisdiction so that simple cases could be dealt with more expeditiously. But, if you don't appoint enough judges, if you defund community legal centres, if you don't fund legal aid as you're supposed to and if you don't fund the ATSILSs as they need to be funded, you'll have some consequences. This is what this government has done, whether it's been under Prime Minister Abbott, Prime Minister Turnbull or Prime Minister Morrison. It doesn't matter; they still have the ideological blinkers on. This particular bill is about dismantling, destroying and diminishing the family law system in this country, and it will have an adverse impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition parties had chances. They made some mistakes, by the way, in John Howard's day. What they did was to create a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and then lead people to believe that it was equal time. The consequence of that was devastating because it raised expectations and dashed them. I saw it again and again and again in the many, many thousands of cases I did. They then prescribed the jurisdiction for federal magistrates and judges to make it more difficult, with hierarchies of presumption between primary obligations, primary considerations and secondary obligations. They fiddled around the edges and made it more difficult and more challenging. But that's not the most egregious thing they did. The most egregious thing they've done since that time is not listen to people. They haven't listened to the 110 individuals and organisations that have pleaded with them not to do what they're doing. A desktop review from a couple of accountants at PwC is really not good enough. Listen to the voices of the former chief justices of the Family Court, as my colleagues have again and again talked about today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the coalition parties over there cannot bring themselves to really own this is shown by the fact that, if you look at the lists of speakers today and tonight, you can barely see one of their members. They rolled out the poor old member for Fisher. I don't mind the member for Fisher. He's not a bad sort of bloke. I don't mind him. But he's never even practised in the area. He said that in his speech today. He was a barrister, but he didn't practise in the area. He had no idea what he was talking about, sadly, because he never practised at all in the area, and he talks about how the family law system is to operate. Look at what they're doing in this legislation. They're diminishing. They have simply failed again and again when given the opportunity to take this legislation off the table. The Attorney-General, in a stubborn, pig-headed way, will not do so. The public wants him to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could attend to the problems in this jurisdiction. We've seen evidence—and some of my colleagues have referred to it—about how many hundreds and hundreds of cases judges in the system are dealing with. That was the evidence that came through in the inquiry, in the dissenting Labor report that we put in. Do you know what that is? That's not enough resources. That's what the Australian Law Reform Commission said. You under-resourced the system. You've underfunded it. You haven't appointed enough judges. I've had barristers and solicitors from my home state of Queensland, where I was the senior partner of a Brisbane CBD law firm, tell me again and again that there have been vacancies for judges in Brisbane and elsewhere, and they haven't appointed them. They might promote someone up to the appeals division without promoting someone on the ground. You don't promote, you don't have enough resources and you also take away things like funding. It's ridiculous that you have to wait such a long time to get a family report. You know why? Because there's not enough funding in the system to do it. You need those independent children's lawyers, those independent representatives, to act in those difficult family law cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think, when you listen to those opposite—and, sadly, to some people in our community—that all of these cases get to trial. The fact is that only about five per cent of cases where people have actually instituted proceedings ever get to a final hearing. I did more consent orders and binding financial agreements at interim hearings or after family reports were prepared than cases ever got to a final hearing. I did a lot more final hearings than ever went to the Full Court of the Family Court or even to the High Court. Most people settle their cases. Most Australians want to act in the best interests of their children and provide financial support for them. Most Australians do the right thing. They do. But there are the ones that are complaining again and again. Some people think that the Family Court system's biased against one gender. It is not. When you look at the legislation, the Family Law Act makes it very clear that it takes into consideration the best interests of children, and it takes a whole range of factors into consideration as well. Children have a right to know and be cared for by both parents, regardless of their marital status, and by other people who are significant to their care, welfare and development—grandparents and uncles and aunties and other people who are going to contribute and help them in their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to think about this legislation: think about what you're doing. This is not an academic exercise. This is not affecting that person who might be charged with a criminal offence, that debtor or that creditor or that person who might have been injured at work. In our lives and in this place, there would be many people who went through the family law system. You might have friends and relatives who have. You would have—many of them have. This legislation is going to adversely impact them and their children, and your children and your children's children. This is a very consequential bill that will impact for years and years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they dismantle the Family Court system as we know it, what will they next do in a situation of child support? In child support, we had to rely on the case of Mee &amp; Ferguson in the Family Court system and the legislative changes that were necessary before the Child Support (Assessment) Act and Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act were brought in in the late 1980s. That improved the payment of child support, but it had to be almost a very strong legal compulsion. You still had the rights for people to seek reviews if they wanted to, internally as well as on to the tribunals and courts if they needed to, under section 117 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. Those rights were still there. But until those legislative interventions people weren't paying enough child support, which meant all of us were paying more social security payments to people because people, whether male or female, mums or dads, weren't paying the way for their own children. They weren't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you pass legislation today that dismantles the Family Court system in this country, there will be consequences. There will be consequences for children. What happens then to those children? What happens to those individuals who are going through this system? How long will it take before they get justice? It will be longer; it will not be shorter. There'll be less access to financial support and legal aid. The legal aid system has already been dismantled by those opposite. That was one of the first acts they did. When the shadow Attorney-General was the Attorney-General in this country and I was the parliamentary secretary—what they now call assistant minister—in our last budget we put extra money, about $40 million, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal aid, community legal centres et cetera. The first act of this government was to dismantle the legal aid system and that funding and rip it away from places like the Taylor Street Community Legal Service centre up there in Hervey Bay. Don't do this. Don't pass this legislation. This will have terrible consequences for families across this country. Just don't do it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I commend the member for Blair for his contribution. It was a fine contribution, and I echo many of the sentiments that he made in this place. I rise to speak on this Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, and I do so stating from the outset that we, in Labor, wholeheartedly oppose this bill. I also support the member for Isaacs on his second reading amendment to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a reflection on this Morrison government, the emptiness of this Morrison government, that it would put forward a reform such as this. This is a significant reform that is going to affect the lives of thousands and thousands of Australians. This is a dramatic reform and one where stakeholders and experts in the area of family law have not just politely requested but pleaded with the government to stop and reflect on what these changes the government is putting forward will mean to ordinary Australians. Of course, this government, when implementing a reform as significant as this, does not even have the heart to get its members to come up and defend it. Barely any of them stood up to talk about and to defend this reform to the Family Court of Australia. Barely any of them bothered to get up and defend this action by the Attorney-General, because on that side of the House either they don't care enough about the lives of the Australians that they are going to affect by implementing this reform or they don't believe in their own legislation. I don't know which one is sadder, but it is evident that this government is willing to throw out one of the most important institutions in this country, one that tackles some of the most complex and difficult problems that face Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family problems are complicated. Families are complicated. Australian families are complicated. And it is not right for politicians to insert ourselves into the middle of their families. It is appropriate that, if in the event it's needed, there are channels and courts to deal with it, as the previous member, the member for Blair, outlined. We on this side of the House absolutely appreciate that the system is not perfect. It's not perfect. There are things that are going wrong in the Family Court. There is a huge waiting list. But the way to fix that waiting list is not to amalgamate the Family Court and to take away the expertise and the focus and the experience that comes with having a specific Family Court of Australia and to amalgamate it with the Federal Circuit Court. The way to fix it is to actually resource it properly: provide it with the funding and the resources and maybe even—call me crazy!—appoint a judge once or twice. But the Attorney-General seems to be absolutely stubborn in his approach to this court. He has refrained and refused to support the court and to give it the resources and infrastructure and the personnel and appointees that it so desperately needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's some history: those opposite do not even bother to speak on their own legislation, which is stock standard in this place; there are not many bills that this government introduces that government MPs bother to stand up on. But, for one as important as this, you'd have thought at least some of them would have stood up and acknowledged the significance and maybe even defended the reforms, but that seems to be a step too far for the members opposite. So many reforms—so many great reforms—in this country were not implemented by a lethargic and stagnant government like this; they were implemented by a Labor government keen not to waste their time in office and keen to implement the reforms required to help make Australian lives and Australian livelihoods better. So, in 1974, when the Whitlam government introduced the Family Law Act, it was debated in this place. It was debated, and almost half of the members of this place and in the other place down the road spoke on this bill. They spent 28 sitting hours debating the bill. It wasn't a reform that was ignored. They didn't throw in one or two MPs and then sit down. The number of Australians affected by this court was reflected by the number of MPs willing to stand up and say why it was important. But, for the life of me, I'm yet to hear one single reason why this government thinks this idea is a worthy one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going on this idea of acknowledging the fact that there is backlog that needs to be addressed, this government didn't listen to the Australian Law Reform Commission. In 2019, the Australian Law Reform Commission did a comprehensive report on the family law system. They made 60 recommendations. One of the key recommendations and key findings was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the Australian Law Reform Commission pointed out the most obvious problem with the Family Court. It is not that there isn't some amalgamation required or some watering down of the specialisation of the judges and of the appointees in the court; it's the fact that the court has been neglected, and it has been neglected by consecutive governments—the Abbott government, the Turnbull government and now the Morrison government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of listening to the Law Reform Commission's report, what this government did was commission PwC to put forward a different proposal. PwC basically had a chik-chak look at it over six weeks, came back and put forward these recommendations. But it flies in the face of experts, former judges, the Law Reform Commission and the general public. Everyone is saying to the government, 'Please don't do this.' This is going to hurt Australian families. This is going to impact on ordinary Australians' access to a court that they need to sort out internal family disputes. This is going to hurt ordinary Australians who have everyday problems in their lives and in their families. Things go wrong in families, and that's devastating, but it's also important that people have the mechanisms through which to move on. The dilution of this court is going to affect those families who are seeking that avenue to improve, and to get on with, their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we say clearly to this government: you don't need to do this. Making it harder for Australians to access the Family Court is not a legacy that you're going to look back on and be proud of. You're not going to be proud to look back and say: 'Instead of listening to experts and listening to those who specialise in, and spend their days and lives dedicated to, the family law system in Australia, we just did our own thing, and nobody even bothered to turn up and defend it. We just rushed through these changes to the Family Court of Australia. Quite frankly, none of our members care enough to bother to come into this place and talk about them, but we're just going to do it anyway.' You don't need to do it. Certainly, I would say to those in the other place that you don't need to pass this bill. This bill does not need to be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Court does tend to deal with those from vulnerable and lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Sadly, because of the extra stresses on those families, they find themselves before the Family Court at a higher rate. To amalgamate this court—to dilute it and to merge it—is to make it more difficult for those families and especially for those kids, and it will reduce the standard of hearings. The government does not need to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke of all of those who have opposed this legislation. One of the latest thorough investigations into this was done in the Australian Senate, and, of course, the Labor senators issued a dissenting report. One of the things they said was that this bit of reform by the government has been almost universally condemned, that the number of submissions by experts outlining the harm that this potential merger would do was immense and that, in contrast, there was no evidence that the reforms before us today are actually going to fix the issues that the Family Court have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After reducing the resources and failing to appoint judges, this government has decided to introduce the legislation that is before the House today. What a good government would do is to stand in this place and say: 'Yes, there are issues in the Family Court and we haven't given it the resources that it needs, but we're keen to get this right. We're keen to make sure that Australian kids and Australian families have the resources to deal with the complex family needs of Australians.' A good government would get up in this place and say: 'Here are the ways in which we're going to make this better and fairer for Australians. Here are the ways that we're going to improve it and consult and work with those in the industry and those who are experts in this. What we're going to do is make sure that our duties and the duty of the Attorney-General, the highest law officer in the land, are not neglected. We will make sure that for every vacancy we are going to hunt down the best candidates so that the court is filled with competent and dedicated people to make this work.' That's what a good government would do. That's what the reforms that are needed would look like. Instead, like the typical Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, they come in this place and waste government. They waste what good government could be. They are content on that side of the House with putting forward legislation that is not, at its heart, going to improve the lives of Australians. In their stubbornness against the experts, they are using government to ram through bills that this country does not need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder how many people on that side of the House are entirely comfortable with the Attorney-General and his approach of not funding the Family Court, not investing in the future of the court, not resourcing it adequately, ignoring the experts and ignoring the retired judges who have come out of retirement in order to make their point—rather, the Attorney-General's approach is to go off a short review conducted by a large accounting firm. We actually don't know, because, as with so many bills in this place, the government MPs have not even bothered to turn up to this debate and defend this reform, which is a real tragedy given the significance of it, the harm it's going do to Australian families and the impact it's going to have on Australian lives. We oppose this bill and we support the second reading amendment put forward by the member for Isaacs.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  There are a few things that families need when there's been a family breakdown and where the parents or, in cases where there are not children, the couple who are dissolving their marriage cannot agree on the resolution of that dissolution. There are a few things that they need and, of course, chief amongst those is a system that is responsive to their needs in which they have access to justice. If someone is in a marriage breakdown, particularly where there are children involved, sometimes the reason that resolution can't be reached between the parties without the need of external assistance can be that people are just unreasonable. But in a lot of cases that's not the source of the lack of private resolution. In a lot of cases there's a difference in power, in status or in financial means. In a lot of cases there are genuine reasons why external assistance through the court system is needed. In a substantial proportion of those cases that are disputed, family and domestic violence is a feature. This is an issue that was raised by the former Chief Justice of the Family Court and has been a hallmark of a number of the inquiries in relation to family law in this country—the fact that a large proportion, not a majority but a large minority, of cases that are disputed, that are unable to be resolved between the parties, have family violence as a feature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that families need as well as access to justice is a system that is responsive to and understands the dynamics of family and domestic violence. What they have at the moment is not meeting those needs; it is not. Cases are delayed. The court system is difficult to navigate. It is expensive. It is under-resourced. A feature of the under-resourcing is that judges, who are only human, don't necessarily have the time that they would perhaps like to have to devote themselves to updating their knowledge in relation to family and domestic violence dynamics, because this is a field that is evolving all the time. There is always new research in relation to understanding family and domestic violence. That's the situation at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, don't address those problems. They don't address the lack of access to justice or the need for improved information within the system about family and domestic violence dynamics; they do not. Instead, they do something that no stakeholder of any significance supports; they collapse the Family Court into the Federal Circuit Court. The Law Council of Australia has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the merger would abolish the existing specialist, stand-alone, multi-disciplinary Family Court system dedicated exclusively to family law matters … What currently exists as a stand-alone, superior court ecosystem would be collapsed into a division of an inferior, generalist, over-worked and under-resourced Federal Circuit Court, to the detriment of families' wellbeing. The Federal Circuit Court already struggles to manage the workload of less complex family matters alongside nine other diverse areas including migration and workplace law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not in the interests of families or judges. That's from the Law Council of Australia. That is a succinct description—and I hope members opposite consider that when they think about their vote on these bills—of what this legislation does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say it is important that the Law Council says this is not in the interests of families or judges. It is important to recognise the immense pressure and burdens on judges of the Family Court and judges of the Federal Circuit Court. The judges in the Federal Circuit Court have massive workloads. The people before them are often unrepresented. They are appearing in things like bankruptcy matters; immigration matters—they are unrepresented in immigration matters, often not having English as a first language; discrimination matters under human rights legislation; and, of course, family law matters. And these judges have huge numbers of cases on their dockets. If you think about this, there are a couple of judges of the Federal Circuit Court who have more than 600 individual cases on their dockets alone, there are a few who have got 500 to 600 cases and then you've got 21 judges of the Federal Circuit Court in this country who have between 400 and 500 cases on their dockets. And the average is 337 cases per judge. An immense workload of cases, diverse areas of law, often unrepresented litigants—it is no wonder that Federal Circuit Court judges are facing incredible stress and pressure. We have seen some of the pressure and some of the stress manifest recently, including in my home state of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government could be addressing that problem. They could be saying, 'Instead of trying to collapse the Family Court into the Federal Circuit Court, we should be addressing the access-to-justice problems that come with overworked, under-resourced court systems, and we could be addressing the impact that that has on judges as well.' In fact, the Productivity Commission, about six years ago, released a substantive report in relation to access to justice in this country. The government could be revisiting that report to consider what further steps could be taken, consistent with the recommendations in that report, in relation to access to justice for both family law and all other forms of federal law, particularly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could also be turning to the Australian Law Reform Commission report into family law that came out last year. It's a report they are completely ignoring, if this bill is anything to go on. It clearly laid out something in the order of 60 recommendations to this government about what they could do to improve family law. They could also look, because of the nexus between family and domestic violence in family law, to the excellent and bipartisan work done by the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, under the leadership of now Senator Sarah Henderson and our member for Newcastle, Sharon Claydon MP. They are people who are able to work together to find opportunities for bipartisanship on reforms that could serve the interests of women—who are generally the victims and survivors of family and domestic violence—and their children, and of all parties before the Federal Circuit Court or the Family Court of Australia, in relation to family and domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They could revisit that piece of excellent work, which also produced so many recommendations. There's been Law Reform Commission work on family violence. There's been a Senate inquiry on family violence. There are so many pieces of work laying out for this government a very clear set of recommendations about what they can do to make things better for people, particularly people who are facing family and domestic violence and—on top of the danger and the injury and the humiliation of the violence—having to go through the retraumatisation that occurs when you then have to litigate because the ex-partner is using the tools at that person's disposal to cause them further harm, as is often the case. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some excellent community legal centres in this country. Women's Legal Service Queensland in Brisbane is one of them. They speak out for victims and survivors of family and domestic violence, and a lot of their work is in relation to family law. Women's Legal Service Queensland opposes these changes, as do so many other stakeholders. In fact, the Law Council of Australia says that more than 110 stakeholders in the family law system agree that the merger is not the solution and they oppose the bill because it will put families at risk. The government's bill is putting families at risk. They're putting families at risk. What's worse, as the member for Macnamara said, not only are they putting families at risk they're not even willing to defend their reasoning for doing that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are they? Why is the chamber virtually empty of coalition MPs? Are they ashamed of the legislation? They should be. Is that why they're not here to defend it? Is that why the speaking list is so bereft of government MPs willing to at least explain why they would support this policy, this bill, instead of standing up for and speaking out on what is needed to be done to protect vulnerable people, particularly women and children, through this country, in relation to family and domestic violence? Is that what the problem is? They should be here. They ought be here to explain to the people of Australia why they support this bill, but they're not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's speakers are here because we have grave concerns about this bill and we oppose it. We call on those who support families to oppose it as well. If the bill reaches the other place, we call on the senators to think very carefully about the impact their vote might have on families in this country, particularly vulnerable families, particularly families facing violence, particularly in a situation where there are big differences in power between the partners who are separating. I do call on them to think very carefully about this bill. It ought not be supported, and I ask that people oppose the legislation.</span>

In thinking about this legislation and the excellent contributions of my colleagues on this side of the House, I have also been thinking of that great Australian historian, Manning Clark, who saw our history as a contest. He saw it as a contest between 'enlargers' and reactionaries—he called them 'straighteners'—and I think we see that echoed in this debate. I think it is important that we reflect on its significance because Australia has been, in so many ways, an exemplar to the rest of the world when it has come to social policy—economic policy too, but particularly social policy. Indeed, when our Federation first began, we often saw Australia described as the 'world's social laboratory' over initiatives like the aged pension, where we led the world. That's been a tradition which has characterised the work of Manning Clarke's enlargers, who we would see as being the people who've made up Labor governments—and the social movements that have supported them—for the last 120-odd years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about enlargers in the context of Australian history, obviously the figure of Gough Whitlam looms very, very large—literally and figuratively. Gough Whitlam was a great enlarger, a great Australian and a great reforming Prime Minister. The reforms of his all-too-short government have done so much to characterise what is so good about modern Australia: our place in the world, how we have ordered our society. In so many ways he was a reformer—from that iconic image of him and Vincent Lingiari that's in the National Portrait Gallery to his sense of our future as a trading nation, if we look at other debates that are on foot now—ripping apart 23 years of stultification under conservative governments, governments of straighteners, to replace them with a sense of what we could be: a much more equal society. Of all of those social reforms, the Family Law Act is both enduring and fundamental. It is a signature reform. It is also a cornerstone, I think, of both a more equal and a more caring society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that in the last 45 years in establishing two critical frameworks for how we manage family law. Firstly, the provision of no-fault divorce. It is impossible—perhaps for many of us here—to understand what life was like for many people before there was no-fault divorce. It has transformed society, recognising that relationships are, of course, formed between human beings with all their fallibilities and vulnerabilities. This goes to the second pillar of the Family Law Act, which was to put in place the family law court—a specialist court to understand those vulnerabilities, those challenges, and to put in place all the mechanisms to see disputes, or other issues between families and those involving children, dealt with appropriately. These reforms have transformed lives for the better. They've transformed our society for the better too. We should not treat them lightly. Unfortunately, the legislation that is before the House does that. It treats these reforms, and the lives that they have shaped, too lightly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back to this sense of how reform is made and how it is resisted, because the reform journey clearly isn't complete. We are not as prosperous or as equal as we should or could be as a society. That continues to be the responsibility of government and it will be the work of an Albanese Labor government. We will keep fighting for the reforms that have been achieved against those reactionary forces in this parliament and in our society who seek to push back against them. We don't believe that our reformist history is written. I think about the bold commitments the leader of the Labor Party made in his budget reply speech, building on this tradition from the aged pension to the NDIS with reforms flagged around early learning and child care—which would be signature social and economic reforms that are all too overdue—and, of course, also to do the work that was asked of us—all of us in this place—by the Statement From the Heart, to complete this parliament and complete our constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the bills that are before the House, I want to touch upon a couple of questions that go to both process and substance. Both are important here. They underscore the characterisation of this government not so much as straighteners but as out and out reactionaries. I have before me a letter dated 29 November which is signed by number of very significant bodies: the Law Council of Australia, Women's Legal Services Australia, NATSILS—the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services—and Community Legal Centres Australia. It's a short letter, but it's a very powerful one that demands the attention, I believe, of every member of this House and all those in the other place, should the legislation make its way there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost are the contributions of Elizabeth Evatt and Alastair Nicholson, the first and second Chief Justices of the Family Court. The Hon. Elizabeth Evatt AC, in talking about her strong view that the merger would lead to undesirable outcomes for children and families, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Court was designed purposely as a world-leading, specialist, stand-alone Court to deal only with family law matters, with the support of a dedicated multi-disciplinary team of counsellors and mediators. Its stand-alone nature is one its greatest attributes, providing protections for vulnerable people in need of family law assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She goes on to talk about how merging this court with all those critical features would undermine both its integrity and the structural specialisation of the court. She says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The impact of losing this institutional specialisation is not properly understood, and has been downplayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really critical warning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend and colleague the member for Griffith raised this issue in referring members opposite to the Australian Law Reform Commission's very significant report handed down only last year. It's a significant report containing 60 recommendations. It's a significant report which identified significant challenges in our family law system, largely linked to chronic underinvestment—not a matter these bills will deal with, not a matter the government has responded to and not a matter the present Attorney-General seems concerned about. This is a really big bit of work, a substantive bit of work, looking at the challenge that is before Australia's government when it comes to having a family law system and the judicial infrastructure that supports it and that does justice to the needs of all Australian families—the partners, their children and their particular vulnerabilities, as many of my colleagues touched upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is incredibly complicated and incredibly important. For all of us who have entered into marriages or lifelong partnerships, it's the most important decision we make. Having a specialised justice system that deals with that and deals with the most important people in most of our lives, our children—for those of us who are fortunate enough to have them—gives them the support that they need. These are fundamentally important things. I am sure every member of this place agrees with that. That is why it is so astonishing that we haven't seen a proper debate in this place and we haven't seen a proper or, indeed, any evidence of any consideration of the Australian Law Reform Commission's report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me back to the warning of the Hon. Elizabeth Evatt. The impact of losing this structure, she says, is not properly understood. I think members opposite should reflect and ask themselves this question: do I properly understand the implications of the change that is before the House? If they can't answer that—frankly, they should be answering that not to their conscience but in words that appear in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> tomorrow—they should vote against these bills. They should vote against these bills because the case has not been made. Indeed, more than that, the case against acting in this manner is incredibly persuasive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked about particular vulnerabilities, to note an additional concern, and I know this is another concern that unites all members of this place. Evatt goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The increasing number of cases in which issues of family violence and child abuse are raised has led to an even greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions. The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very serious warning. Before I came to this place, I practised as a lawyer. I did not practise in the area of family law, and I don't presume to have any speciality in this area. But I worked alongside many colleagues who did, and I understand how important it was for them to be specialist practitioners within a specialist jurisdiction. They understood that they could build confidence in their clients, particularly those clients with vulnerabilities, in a system that was designed to meet their needs, not the more adversarial needs of our common law courts more generally. I think this is something that we should reflect on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about how public policy should be made. Really there are two issues that should inform those of us in this place when we consider legislation, particularly significant legislation like this. Firstly, we should look at the evidence—and there is no evidence supporting these bills. We should also try to give voice to the experience of those most affected by the bills. I will refer to some of those things, but I want to make a brief reflection on the basis of the understanding I have from organisations and community law centres in my electorate and around it. They all speak with one voice. They do not support these bills. They see the bills as undermining the vital work they do in protecting vulnerable children and in protecting victims-survivors. These are matters again that members opposite, members on the government benches, should give serious consideration to before they cast their vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about the contribution of Elizabeth Evatt. I want to also now touch on the contribution of her successor, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, the second chief justice. He expressly endorses her remarks and her view. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is unbelievable that Government would propose the dissolution of a Federal Superior Court in this fashion without the most careful and searching Public Inquiry and without carrying out significant research and without consulting the many experts in this field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is again a very striking contribution from someone who should be listened to. He asks a very fundamental question. This is fundamentally important legislation. It would interfere with a cornerstone of not just our legal framework but how our society has been operating. It is being done without recourse to expertise, without recourse to public submissions and without recourse to any of the processes that should underpin significant reform. This is not how our society is enlarged—far from it. This is an exercise of unthinking reactionary nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two chief justices are far from alone, as I think my comments have indicated. There is an open letter signed by 110 stakeholders. These 110 people deal every day with the challenges that present themselves in the family law system and all its complexities. These people are of one mind, as we on this side of the House are. These are retrograde changes. This is flawed legislation. It's unclear what it emerges from, because all the ordinary processes of government would lead the Attorney-General and members opposite to a very different set of conclusions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pauline Wright says, 'This is a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families.' I say again 'a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families'. In this place we differ on so many things—how we see the world and the role of government—but I'm sure none of us want to be seen as gambling with the lives of children and families. Yet that is precisely what anyone supporting these proposals would be doing. They would be supporting a massive leap into the unknown. It's not even that. This leap is more than inadvisable; it is profoundly wrong and profoundly unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The comments I have referred to are echoed by so many more. Indeed, the dissenting report of Labor senators sets out this story well in short terms. They use the same word three times—neglect, neglect, neglect. That is the record of this government entering into its eighth year. It doesn't have an answer to the problems in the family law system so it seeks to do something to compound the problems. What we need is a government that will enlarge—not this government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  Through the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, the government seeks to abolish or dissolve the Family Court. That is a massive change to our judicial architecture. It's a change that affects the administration of a particularly important area of law. It's not a change that should be made lightly, particularly when you consider, as the member for Scullin has just pointed out, the very serious concerns that have been raised by expert stakeholders. You can't be more of an expert than former chief justices of the Family Court, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Law Reform Commission and so on. They've raised very, very serious concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are going to come along at the very end of a difficult year and make such a radical change to longstanding judicial architecture in such a critical area, you'd want to do so on a pretty careful and substantial basis. Yet, as we've seen so often this year, bills like this come along and seek to make radical change—I think, in this case, to perpetrate a kind of vandalism upon the way things have worked, and worked quite well, in this country for a long period of time—without any convincing argument being made for that change. There's no convincing argument in the material. The Attorney-General hasn't been able to advance any convincing argument, and we're not seeing any convincing argument in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be prepared to accept a different view if someone in the government wants to point to who exactly on that side of the parliament has come in here and taken stock of the abolition and dissolution of the Family Court of Australia and explain exactly why that's going to occur in the shadow of Christmas 2020. I haven't seen a single member of the government come in and make that argument, and that should be cause for concern. I don't know what parliament is for if it's not for us, on behalf of the people we represent in the best interests of Australia, to look closely at these kinds propositions—to examine them carefully, and, in debate, flesh out exactly what the basis for making such a radical and far-reaching change is and whether or not there are any wrinkles or barnacles on what is proposed to be launched. I don't think you'd have to look too closely at this to see those kinds of barnacles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian society has had the benefit of its Family Court and its exclusive focus on family law since the reforms of the Whitlam government. All of us will have had some experience of the importance of family law matters either in our own lives or in the lives of our extended families and close friends and certainly through our work as representatives. I don't think you could be a representative in this place for more than a month or two before you would hear from someone in your community who is going through a family law matter. They are by their nature very difficult. They stem from the instability, conflict and disagreements that sometimes are part of even the closest of human relationships. So having something supportive in place to allow those conflicts to be considered and resolved—mediated or dealt with in another way that allows the people in those relationships to move on to something different in a way that is orderly and safe and considerate for men, women and anyone who's part of a partnership, particularly for children—is so important. It's so important that that part of our legal system and our judicial system is of the highest quality, and yet what's being proposed here is the abolition of what has been a foundation stone, institutionally, of that area of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms of the Whitlam government—institutions like the Family Court—have without doubt made a contribution to better dispute resolution in families and to fairer outcomes, I would say, especially for women; to less conflict; and, in many cases, to much safer and healthier outcomes for children. I had reason to go back and look at what Prime Minister Whitlam said in 1974: 'The essence of family courts is that they will be helping courts. That's what they're designed to do.' He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that. Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. Parties will not be driven to the court by their own despair as a last resort; they will be encouraged to come to the welfare and counselling staff of the court whenever they have a matrimonial problem, even if they are not contemplating proceedings of any kind. This help would also be available after divorce proceedings, and this would, as I have already indicated, be of great importance where there were young children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That vision of the Family Court and related family law reforms has been part of Australian life now for 40 years. It was part of my life as a young person. My parents parted ways when I was five—my brother was three and my sister was one. I've had some experience of going through those processes. I know that they're difficult, but I also know that the system we have in Australia, particularly since those reforms, has meant that those processes, that hurt and those kinds of disputes and complicated matters that need to be resolved at least have a framework and structure through which that can occur, which is much better than the kind of law of the jungle that would prevail otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one would say that the existing system is perfect, of course it's not—there isn't any system that's perfect—and there are always ways in which reform can be considered, but you have to ensure that the reform that you're thinking about actually addresses the problems that exist. There is nothing in any of the evidence that suggests that abolishing or dissolving the Family Court will deal with some of the problems that have identified, such as delay. None of the five reports listed on the Attorney-General's website as informing this bill actually recommend the change that the government is making. When the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System provided its interim report, it referred to 70 separate reviews that were germane to the issue of the good function of family law and the Family Court. Not one of the 70 recommended the abolition or dissolution of the Family Court and the other changes that are contained in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to the extent that there's a need for reform or improvement in relation to things like delay or harmonisation of administrative and procedural matters—great; get on with it!—that's what the Attorney-General should have been doing in some of the previous seven years.  But there's nothing in the abolition of the Family Court itself which will address those problems. In many areas this government bowl along, often at the last minute, doing considerable harm to the way things have worked reasonably well, and certainly better than under their administration, without attending to what clearly are the real problems. Often those real problems have a similar thread or theme. In this case, when it comes to Australian family law, the Australian Law Reform Commission found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key issues with the way that the system works at the moment is that it has been under-resourced. It has been defunded. A defining feature of this government is the art of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Starve an institution of resources, and then if it underperforms, use that as a basis to chop it down, as a basis to knock it over. We've seen the same thing in the area of the environment. The government looks at delays when it comes to environmental decision-making and then sees that as a reason to cut green tape and weaken protections for our environment, when it has cut 40 per cent in funding to the department of the environment, a cut that perfectly coincides with the period in which the delay has increased. We see the same thing here. The Australian Law Reform Commission makes it plain that the chief problem is under-resourcing of the system as it stands, not any structural or institutional problem, and yet following that path of ignoring and neglecting, as the member for Scullin pointed out—neglect is another theme of this government, unfortunately—in turn becomes the basis for doing further radical harm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in my local government days, you'd occasionally have people who would have a building with some sort of heritage quality that they wanted to demolish altogether. We on the council would tell them—I think quite rightly—'No, this has significant community heritage. You own the property, and in that sense you are a custodian of that heritage going forward. You need to look after it.' So what they would bloody-mindedly do, in some cases, is just leave the property to get worse and worse over time. In some cases they seemed to partially redo the roof so that there was a fair bit of rain coming in, and various other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a>  Exactly—demolition by neglect. And that's one of the ways in which this government, sadly, has worked, rather than focusing on systemic issues that can be improved, that can improve delays in the family law system and through the Family Court. Reviews have identified ways in which that can occur: through the timely provision of relevant reports, through proper resourcing and through the timely appointment of judicial officers. Those are how you address problems of delay. Those are how you improve administrative procedural consistency. Coming along and saying, 'Guess what: it's worked very well for 40 years, but we are going to abolish the Family Court,' when not a single member of the government will come here and make that argument, is really astonishing. </span>

This is a change that the Law Council of Australia describes as 'a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families'. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services said it 'will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children'. That is what the government is proposing to do—without any basis, not connected to any of the existing problems that they might get on with and address, not on the foundation of any evidence or any decent analysis, in the shadow of Christmas, with one or two people who are prepared to come up and say something good about it.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  I rise today in the midst of the nation's focus on the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence to speak on these bills which frankly do nothing—well, worse than nothing—in terms of protecting women and children escaping violence. They potentially make the situation far worse. It is to the great shame of this parliament that these bills—the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019—are before this House during these 16 days of activism in particular but it would be a shame at any time, quite frankly. I rise to strongly support the amendment moved by the shadow Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is almost two years ago to the day that I stood in this place and discussed the terrible impacts that the government's bills to merge the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court into a single generalised court would have. It was a damaging plan then and it was thoroughly condemned by the community and by legal stakeholders alike. It was completely unjustified. There was no modelling. There was no white paper. There was next to zero stakeholder engagement. Indeed, there was only a six-week desktop review of operational data by two accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers. From this, the government proposed a drastic restructure that would solve none of the very real pressures that our family law system faces. Indeed, it would create a great deal more problems than it proposed to fix. Those bills were not only friendless; they were despised, and there was widespread relief when they died a natural death upon the expiry of the 45th Parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet here we are with restructured but tragically unimproved bills. They would essentially abolish the Family Court of Australia and thus diminish the important role of a specialist court in helping people through family disputes. The Law Council of Australia was spot on when it responded to the reintroduction of these flawed bills by saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Legislation merging the specialist Family Court into a single generalist court will not alleviate the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of victims of family violence falling through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If passed, these bills would drive the most radical changes to Australia's family law system since its inception in the 1970s under the Whitlam government. Family courts need to be able to respond to any number of very specific and complex issues, which can include drug use, crime, domestic and family violence, and mental health issues. This is a specialist area that demands specialist skills, abilities and services. But this reckless plan from the Morrison Liberal government would essentially abolish the standalone, specialist Family Court, which has been operating now for almost half a century—a court which plays a critical role in supporting those in need of specialist family law assistance, particularly in cases where there is family and domestic violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, this matters. The consequences of reducing our courts' capacity to respond to family and domestic violence are incredibly serious indeed. One woman is killed in Australia by a partner or ex-partner every single week. Already in 2020, 45 Australian women have been killed violently. We know that the post-separation period is one of the most dangerous times for women and children fleeing family violence. This means that the courts are absolute ground zero for domestic violence cases. This is confirmed by the fact that at least 70 per cent of matters brought before the Family Court involve family violence. As AWAVA said in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With such prevalence of family violence matters in courts, family violence can be described as "the core business of the family court."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is heartbreaking, but tragically it is true. It is also true that if the Morrison government diminishes how our courts respond to domestic violence, it will put vulnerable lives at risk. This is shameful, it is arrogant, it is dangerous and it mustn't proceed. I urge the government members to vote against this legislation, to reconsider their position. It's not too late. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course there are massive issues in our courts; no-one is disputing that. However, many issues stem from the chronic underfunding and under-resourcing of the courts following seven years of conservative governments in this country running them down. Judges have as many as 600 cases on their dockets and families are being forced to wait for a year, or even two, for their cases to be resolved in this profoundly overstretched system. This legacy of years of neglect under consecutive Liberal governments is clear, but this bill will go nowhere near solving those problems. Indeed, if it proceeds, this bill will only throw the courts into further chaos and reduce our capacity to protect and support vulnerable Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these very serious risks, it is no surprise that more than 110 family law experts banded together to pen an open letter which calls on this government to abandon this legislation once and for all. The letter actually urges that we go in the opposite direction and increase the level of specialisation in family law and family violence, not dilute and diminish it. The Law Council of Australia's president, Arthur Moses SC, also spoke out on the impacts of this plan, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This misstep will harm families. For more than 40 years, the Family Court has been a premier legal institution, a specialist superior court admired by other family law jurisdictions around the world for its innovative management of the most complex and difficult family law matters. The Bill, will not produce efficiencies, reduce delays, or deliver anything of real value. Nor will they reduce complexity or legal costs in the family law system. In fact, it could make the system worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the Labor Party saying that; that is the president of the Law Council of Australia. This opinion is reflected in my local community, where there is grave concern about the implications of this bill proceeding. Most recently, I was contacted by Ms Alison Roberts, a family law practitioner of more than 14 years experience, who told me, 'For the families of Newcastle and the surrounding areas, this bill is a disaster and will have widespread impacts for the very vulnerable children and families.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When any legislation prompts such unified and vehement condemnation from those that know, it behoves a government to listen. But not this government. Instead, it's doubling down by progressing this dangerous plan through the parliament today. What makes it worse is that the government absolutely knows how serious the problem is, but it is choosing to do nothing about it. In 2017, this government commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the system. The government said at the time that it wanted to ensure that it meets the needs of families and effectively supports vulnerable people in cases where there is family violence or child abuse. Despite this, the government didn't even bother to wait for this important review to report before ploughing on with this senseless piece of legislation to essentially abolish the Family Court of Australia. The arrogance and recklessness of this pre-emptive action is truly breathtaking, and it is shameful. It certainly comes as no surprise to me that only one government member was prepared to defend this legislation today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since these bills were first tabled, the ALRC has released its landmark report. Its findings are shocking, but, again, it's not surprising—certainly not to those with experience of the family law system. The report shines a light on the tragic consequences of starving our courts of resources year on year on year. It describes Australia's family law system as being:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a scathing comment to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALRC findings are mirrored in virtually every conversation I have had with my local legal community members in Newcastle on this matter. They tell me of a chronically underfunded system. They speak of the lengthy delays in replacing judges. They say that matters are taking up to four years to resolve, with families waiting up to a year for family reports—the critical documents that provide an independent assessment of their cases—to be made. They tell me of their worry and concern for our judges, who are each carrying a workload of 1½ judges by themselves. And they tell me of constituents falling through the cracks, thrust into personal danger or stuck in limbo while their family situations deteriorate. This cannot go on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ALRC report included 60 recommendations to address many of these grave systemic issues, but, in a continuation of its usual contempt for expert advice and a belligerent refusal to listen to the facts, the Morrison Liberal government hasn't even bothered to respond. Instead, it has come up with this drastic and completely unjustified restructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also ignored many of the other 12 significant reviews into the family law system which have been undertaken since 2009. I had the honour of deputy chairing one of these inquiries in 2017 for the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee. We looked at what we needed to do in order to create a better family law system that would support and protect those affected by family violence. The inquiry arrived at 33 recommendations, most of which the government has been told again and again, and most of which they have shamefully still done absolutely nothing about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one recommendation that I'd particularly like to draw to the House's attention today, and that's the removal of the presumption of shared equal parental responsibility. This is one of the most commented-on pieces of necessary reform in the family law system. I am currently deputy chairing for the same committee another inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia. Whilst the focus of that inquiry is not on the family law system, people continue to raise this issue around the need to abolish the presumption of shared equal parental responsibility. Indeed, there is significant evidence that this presumption is leading to inappropriate and sometimes downright dangerous parental arrangements. But we can do something about this. It has widespread support in the sector, and it could be done tomorrow and it wouldn't cost a cent. Protecting women and children must be absolutely central to the mission of our family courts and, indeed, our social services system. I urge the government to give serious consideration to removing this presumption as a matter of priority, so I again call on the government to support the private member's bill that sits before this parliament to do just that—remove that presumption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just returning briefly to the bills before us today, it's clear that these bills would diminish our family law system and, in doing so, would literally put the lives of vulnerable families on the line. The Morrison government needs to scrap this plan immediately. Again, I note not a single inquiry has backed the legislation that sits before this parliament tonight—not a single one—and not a single person. This legislation is friendless and it must be scrapped.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  The prime objective of us coming to this place is to do no harm. You would think whatever laws we make in this place should do no harm. When you have an army of very experienced, very well-versed experts in the community—lawyers, specialists, advocates, family and community workers—all united, telling you that the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019, and the accompanying bill, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019, is a bad bill and should not pass this House, you really should listen. And you really should listen especially when there is no counterpoint. Where are the advocates for this bill? Where's big business? Where are the economists? Where are those in the community saying that this bill is a good idea for the families and children of Australia? That's what the Family Court is all about—protecting families and protecting children. There's nobody that I can see in this country who's said this bill is a good idea, that we should abolish the Family Court and subsume it into another model and lose the specialisation which makes it a world leader.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the Family Court has problems. It would be silly to say otherwise. But those problems stem from resourcing. We know from experts—we've got the member for Warringah, who used to work in the Family Court as a barrister—from around the country telling us what the problem is: it's resourcing. We have evidence to Senate committees of judges and the case loads they are under. It's absolutely staggering. The Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, which inquired into the bill, heard evidence that two Federal Circuit Court judges—and this is the court that the government want to send the Family Court to by increasing the workload by creating another division in the Federal Circuit Court: one in the Brisbane registry and one in Wollongong—have got over 600 cases on their dockets. There are 600 cases for each judge at the same time. Three other judges have between 500 and 600 cases, and 21 have between 400 and 500. That's evidence to a Senate committee. It's not made up. It's not some wild claim. It's evidence. It's testimony. It's real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the workload judges are under now, yet this government is doing nothing about resourcing the problem. Instead, it's trying to do this cheap fix—and based on what? Based on listening to a report done in six weeks on desktop computers by a couple of accountants, a report that has been discredited because the findings it came up with were not sound. That's what they're basing this major, massive change on. I won't call it a reform. I know those opposite like to call it a reform. It's not a reform; it's destruction. They're basing it on a report by two accountants who are not experts in the field and have no working knowledge of how things work. They came to some sort of conclusion that the Federal Court was more efficient because the Family Court took longer with cases. There was no regard for the level of complexity involved in Family Court matters. And that's what this government is basing this entire bill on. That's the justification to try to save a bit of money in a system that is already chronically underfunded. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is the Attorney-General should own up to what he is seeking to do with these bills. The government is seeking to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court, and it is purely ideological. The Liberal Party has never liked the Family Court since Whitlam instituted it. It has never liked it and has always wanted to get rid of it in some form or another, even going back to Daryl Williams, the former Liberal AG in the Howard years. The Family Court's always been in their sights. They have an ideological opposition to it. I'm not sure where it stems from, but it's there. It's real. Look at this quote from Gough Whitlam:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The essence of the Family Courts is that they will be helping courts. Judges will be specially and carefully selected for their suitability for the work of the court. There will be attached to the court a specialist staff …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say there are various other experts and helpers. He adds:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">These courts will therefore be very different from the courts that presently exercise family law jurisdiction.</span>
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Family Court will, of course, determine legal rights, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that: Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at what's been occurring in recent years, with our social services, I see it all as part of the same pattern, the dehumanisation of government, the dehumanisation of social services. We've got complete automation of what's come to be known as robodebt. We've got the destaffing of Centrelink and the directives to pensioners and old people and the disabled to go online. Don't seek personal service at the counter. Don't seek human assistance. Do it yourself online, on a computer. It's inhuman. It's dehumanising. We've got issues with veterans trying to deal with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It's a completely dehumanising the experience. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all part of the same pattern. The government is dehumanising social and human services in this nation. They're taking compassion, being human, out of the equation, all just to save a few bucks. It's very disappointing, and no-one is standing to support it. I think we've had two members from the government stand and support this legislation. Mr Wallace and, I believe, Ms Martin are the only two I know who have spoken to the bill. Where is the overwhelming support for this bill from the government benches? Where's the ringing endorsement from those opposite of what this is seeking to achieve? Are you so timid, on that side, so cowed by the Attorney-General, that you're not willing to come into this place and state why this bill should go forward? You're just doing as you're told, like good little soldiers. You'll come in for the vote and that's it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the way this nation should be run, completely dehumanising this legislation. It's a terrible path to go down, to, effectively, abolish the Family Court in this nation. The Family Court was meant to be more than just about exercising legal rights. It should be about putting human compassion back into the system.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  I stand to oppose the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019. This bill, this reckless plan, should be thrown out. It is based on a six-week desktop review by two accountants, with no consultation with the communities and families who need it most. The Morrison government should own up to what they are seeking to do with these bills. They are seeking to use this legislation to abolish the Family Court as a specialist and standalone superior court. The Family Court of Australia is a proud Whitlam legacy, like most of the great social reforms that have occurred in Australia. From Medicare to our world-leading superannuation system, to free legal assistance services for Australians in need, the Family Court of Australia is an institution that has served our nation admirably. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act 1975 instituted two major changes. It instituted no-fault divorce and it established the Family Court of Australia, a specialist multidisciplinary court for the resolution of family disputes. When the family law bill was debated in the House of Representatives—over 45 years ago—nearly half the House, a total of 59 members, made speeches. The House spent 28 sitting hours debating that bill. There was disagreement. There was debate. But across the political spectrum members of the House took the reform seriously. Australian families deserve no less. How many people on the other side of the House have spoken on these bills today—one, two? Do Liberal backbenchers even know what they're voting for? Do they care? Do they understand what this will mean for families facing separation and divorce?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1974 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which had been tasked with reviewing the Family Law Bill 1974, said that the Family Court would be essential to give substance to key aspects of the Family Law Act. The essential distinguishing feature of the Family Court is that it only deals with family law matters. These bills would rob the Family Court of its essential distinguishing feature by collapsing it into one of Australia's busiest, most poorly resourced and overburdened courts—the Federal Circuit Court. In other words, these bills would abolish the Family Court of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specialisation is so important, because family law matters are not like other matters that generalist courts tend to deal with. If anything, the need for a specialist Family Court has only become more pronounced over time. As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted in its landmark 2019 report on the family law system—a report the government commissioned but has completely ignored—the Whitlam government could not have foreseen the growth in the incidence and awareness of family violence and child abuse since 1975. Specialisation does not just mean specialist judges. The Whitlam government's vision of a specialist family law court was of a court with interrelated co-located services and resources. It was about creating an environment that had regard to what Whitlam described as the human problems of couples and families, not just their legal rights. The realisation of that vision has never been more important, especially for vulnerable children and families who need a Family Court system that is not only efficient but also safe and sensitive to their particular needs and vulnerabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone accepts that there are serious problems in the Family Court at present. As the Australian Law Reform Commission found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the family law system has been deprived of resources to such an extent that it cannot deliver the quality of justice expected of a country like Australia, and to whose family law system other countries once looked and tried to emulate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, instead of working to address this fundamental problem and fix the family law system, the government remains determined to restructure the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court in a way that will make a bad situation worse for Australian families, including vulnerable children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In brief summary, the government's bills would combine the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court into one court with two divisions. That court would be called the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. The current Family Court of Australia would become Division 1, while the current Federal Circuit Court of Australia would become Division 2. Both divisions would operate under the leadership of a single chief justice and deputy chief justice, with a single set of rules and a single point of entry. When the government originally proposed this merger in the 45th Parliament, the current Attorney-General said that he would stop appointing new judges to Division 1 as they retire. This would obviously amount to a gradual abolition of Division 1 over time. The Attorney-General has now backed away from that position and promised to keep appointing judges to Division 1. But nothing in the bills would guarantee the continued existence of Division 1. The Attorney-General made his intentions for this merger very clear in the last parliament, but now this Attorney-General says, 'Trust me.' Even if the bills were amended to guarantee the continued existence of Division 1, that would not address the fundamental problem with these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that said, instead of increasing specialisation in the Family Court the Morrison government is going to water it down to effectively abolish it. We will see families who rely on the court doing it tough. It is time these bills were thrown out. It is time for this parliament to listen to families and make the decision to throw these bills out. This reckless plan must go.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  The Victorian government has delivered its budget, and it is an absolute cracker! Premier Daniel Andrews has invested in Victoria because the Prime Minister would not. Victoria's Treasurer is pushing for Victoria because our federal Treasurer could not. We are talking about $25 billion of additional investment, including $5.3 billion for social housing, with about 12,000 new dwellings. That's $5.3 billion from the Andrews government compared to zero dollars from the Morrison government. Social housing is a fantastic investment. As we pull out of the pandemic, it will provide a massive boost to the economy, the construction industry and job creation, and we desperately need it to give thousands of people facing homelessness a place to call home. Importantly, this is a legacy investment—something we should all be proud of. I am proud to inform parliament that at least $200 million of that $5.3 billion will be spent in Geelong and the Surf Coast. My constituents welcome this investment. It's a vote of confidence in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian budget also places a clear emphasis on creating jobs in female-dominated industries, hiring 4,100 tutors to help students in disadvantaged schools catch up after an extremely challenging year and hiring over 1,700 teachers and support staff for students with disabilities. Support for women in the Victorian budget is also evident in its strong investment in child care—something the Commonwealth has failed to deliver. The Andrews government is providing a subsidy for kindergartens worth $2,000 per child and an expansion of after-school-hours care, which will help reduce significant out-of-pocket costs for parents. This House knows all too well the huge drag these costs place on female employment and economic growth. But the federal government won't do anything about it. Recently I spoke with Grovedale mum Pawandeep Gill. She wants her little one to experience the benefits of an early childhood education, but the childcare costs that come with working another day a week outweigh what she would earn working in aged care. Pawandeep wants to work more hours. She will be better off if she can work more days, Pawandeep's child will be better off if Pawandeep can work more days, the aged-care sector will be better off if Pawandeep can work more days and Grovedale will be better off if Pawandeep can work more days. The Andrews government should be commended for making this goal more achievable for Pawandeep. Victorians are rightly asking: where is the Morrison government on this? Why is the federal government not doing more to help women?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another lesson the Morrison government should take from the Victorian budget. It is possible to look after those hardest hit by economic failure without knocking down others in the process. This lesson is essential. Knowing how to do this means the Andrews government will support unemployed young people without putting the strap to people over the age of 35. Knowing how to do this means the Andrews government will stimulate the hard-hit tourism sector without putting unwanted additional pressure on working mothers. And knowing how to do this means that the Andrews government will provide $200 million in support to creative industries without kicking a single university in the face. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer should be taking notes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan put in place by the federal government is simply not enough. The budget the Morrison government released two months ago plans for unemployment to be worse next year than it was through the worst of the pandemic. This is their plan because they plan to withdraw support before the economy has recovered. On 6 October, the government printed in black and white its intention to keep unemployment well above five per cent for the next four years. They plan for about one million Australians to be unemployed this year and next year and the year after. That is their plan and it is a disgrace. Eighty cents in every Australian tax dollar is raised by the federal government. The federal government can borrow money at about 60 per cent of the cost that the Victorian government can, and the Australian Constitution puts responsibility for both commerce and quarantine squarely with the federal government, yet it is a Victorian government that is partnering with Victorians to march out of this pandemic. If you want to find leadership in 2020, if you are looking for courage through crisis, you would be better off looking to Spring Street rather than Capital Circle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Today I am wearing my grandmother's callisthenics medal, as I often do because it reminds me of her and of my links to my local community, which began 100 years ago this year. My grandmother was born and raised in Lower Mitcham in the heart of my electorate of Boothby. Her parents, my great-grandparents, settled in Claire Street in their modest war service home in 1920 after my great-grandfather finally made it home from World War I, having seen action at Pozieres and at Bullecourt, where he was taken prisoner of war. They lived humble lives, guided by their Christian faith and service to our local community. They established the Colonel Light Gardens Baptist church. My grandmother and great-grandmother both taught at Colonel Light Gardens Primary School, and my father and uncle attended local schools and were active volunteers. My dad was a St John's Ambulance cadet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was therefore incredibly proud to be able to continue this history of community service in our local area when I was elected as the member for Boothby in 2016. It is one of the key reasons that I nominated for the seat. I also put up my hand to make a contribution on a range of issues like road and rail infrastructure, foreign interference and investment, endometriosis, stillbirth and the arts. As a lifelong Liberal, I put up my hand to do my part to uphold the principles of the Liberal Party and ensure that Australia remains the safe, strong and stable democracy that guarantees the hard-won freedoms that people like my great-grandfather were willing to sacrifice their lives to defend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are a range of things I did not put up my hand for as a member of parliament. I did not put up my hand for ABC Radio's Peter Goers to criticise my smile and the clothes I wear. I did not put up my hand so that former journalist Mike Carlton could suggest that I should be strangled. I did not put up my hand to have GetUp, Labor and the unions plant their male followers at my street corner listening posts to intimidate me, let alone to scream at me. I did not put up my hand so I could be the sole candidate heckled, mocked and shouted down by GetUp, Labor and union members at community meetings. I did not put up my hand so my election posters could be defaced with the words 'skank' and 'blow and go', suggesting I was a prostitute who charged $60 an hour. And I certainly did not put up my hand to be stalked by a creepy old man who regularly appeared with GetUp and who did not stop until the South Australian police charged him with stalking me, despite requests from me and the AFP that he stop his terrifying behaviour</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of these things happened during my first election. They happened during my second election because of the combined efforts of GetUp, the Labor Party and the unions, whose vicious campaign against me encouraged the behaviour, perpetrated almost exclusively by men, that I have just described. We now know, thanks to the questions put to GetUp by my colleagues the member for Barker and Senator Abetz in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, that GetUp train their volunteers in the practice of bird-dogging. In short, this tactic seeks to hunt down and harass a candidate, getting to know their routines and turning up uninvited and unexpected at every opportunity to intimidate them. This is exactly what GetUp did to me in conjunction with the stalker, the Labor Party and the unions. Notably, the head of GetUp, Paul Oosting, refused to rule out using these tactics again. So other women, other candidates like me, can expect that they too will be harassed, intimidated and made to feel unsafe in their workplace. Given the Labor Party and the unions have not distanced themselves from the tactics of their good friends at GetUp, they clearly condone these tactics too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, GetUp, Labor and the unions all claim to oppose sexism and misogyny and to support women's workplace safety, yet it appears they only do so for women on their side of politics, as Senator Penny Wong recently demonstrated when she claimed there was no coordinated sexist campaign against me at the last election. GetUp, Labor and the unions can pretend that their tactics did not cause the behaviour that occurred in Boothby in 2019, but the facts, like their disgraceful behaviour and their actions, speak for themselves.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COLLINS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data on the labour force in Tasmania was incredibly concerning. Tasmania now has the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 8.2 per cent. More alarmingly, Tasmania also has the lowest participation rate in the country, just 61.4 per cent. We also have the lowest employment-to-population ratio, with just 56.3 per cent of Tasmanians in the workforce. We have the second highest underemployment rate after Victoria, at 10.4 per cent, based on the latest ABS data. There is only one job vacancy for every 27 Tasmanians currently looking for work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, of course, that it is since the government cut some of the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments that unemployment in Tasmania has, clearly, got worse. What is very concerning now is that Tasmanians are expecting more to come, with the government currently planning to cut the coronavirus supplement, from the end of December, to over 36,400 Tasmanians who currently receive that payment, and then the JobKeeper changes and cuts coming at the end of March. We also know that many Tasmanian businesses will not be eligible for the new hiring job credit that is supposed to come in to replace this wage subsidy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really alarming is that the Tasmanian state budget, which was brought down just a couple of weeks ago, predicts that unemployment in Tasmania will stay at over eight per cent until the end of 2022. That is two more full years of an incredibly high unemployment rate in my home state of Tasmania. And the participation rate is expected to drop even lower. There will be fewer Tasmanians looking for work and more Tasmanians unemployed. It is incredibly concerning that the state budget documents actually state in black and white that employment is expected to decline by 1¾ per cent in 2021 in year average terms, reflecting the effect of the JobKeeper payment program tapering. That is what the Tasmanian state budget says. It shows that the level of unemployment in Tasmania is due to the current federal government withdrawing too soon the support the Tasmanian economy needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania has recently reopened its borders to other states and territories in Australia, and I say to everyone who has always wanted to visit Tasmania: please come on down in the coming weeks and months. It is an absolutely beautiful place. I know that many Australians have never had the opportunity before to visit Tasmania. So I say to them, 'Come down'—because the data released late on Friday shows that the occupancy rates for our hotels in southern Tasmania, where I live and where the capital, Hobart, is, are over 50 per cent down on what they were in October last year. That's over 50 per cent down. That is not sustainable for the Tasmanian economy. We know that we need to encourage more Australians to come to visit Tasmania; obviously, there are no visitors coming from overseas. But, more importantly, we know that the federal and state Liberal governments need to have a proper jobs plan for Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the Tasmanian state budget says that unemployment is expected to stay at over eight per cent for the next two years is simply not good enough. It shows that the federal and state governments are not doing enough to keep Tasmanians in jobs and to create more jobs in our island state. The HomeBuilder changes on the weekend were simply the federal government trying to fix a program that it had already mucked up. It is not enough. We need more Tasmanians in work. We need the state and federal governments to understand that Tasmania is suffering particularly badly. We are going to see much worse, come the end of some of these payments in December and March, and I'm incredibly concerned about what has happened in Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania did well for a brief period because of those supports, because of the stimulus, but also because of the huge amount of money through the early release of super that Tasmanians used to support themselves. Indeed, if you look at the funds that were injected into Tasmania between May and September, there was $1.5 billion in COVID supplements, stimulus and payments, but there was $600 million from Tasmanians' own super accounts—at least $600 million in that time. So that's $2.1 billion that went into the Tasmanian economy in five months to prop it up. That is being withdrawn, and the Tasmanian economy is going to suffer without a proper jobs plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  We all want to make Australia make again. We want manufacturing back. One thing that COVID has identified is that we as a nation are vulnerable because we've lost our industrial base and our manufacturing sector is a shadow of its former self. We have developed smarter, niche manufacturing, but that doesn't keep an economy going when you're isolated in a crisis, such as what's happened in COVID. Why did so much of our manufacturing go overseas? Why did our manufacturing job numbers in 1990 amount to 1.17 million as opposed to 855,000 in 2020? The answer has a lot to do with the cost of electricity. We have a high-wage economy in Australia, which everyone loves. It gives us a good standard of living. But we have given away our competitive advantage in reliable, cheap electricity, which was some of the cheapest in the world and is now the most expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For manufacturing—whether it's processing raw materials, metals, food or fibres into semiprocessed goods or extensively processed goods—you need bundles of energy. Manufacturing without cheap electricity is like an irrigation farm without cheap water. If you have expensive water, you can't afford to make money out of growing crops. It is the same with manufacturing: you can't make money unless your electricity cost, which is usually your greatest cost, is reasonable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have our costs for electricity gone up? Because of many reasons. We have destroyed our competitive advantage. In the rush to a decarbonised economy, we have put regulations in the energy markets favouring renewables. We've had regulatory subsidies in the form of the Renewable Energy Target, which has generated the existence of renewable energy certificates. We have, as we know, gold plated some of the poles and wires. With some of the state regulations, there's a guaranteed return on gold plating and putting in expensive grid infrastructure. But the main reason we have expensive electricity is that the so-called cheap renewably generated electricity is only available between 20 and 30 per cent of the time, and that is destroying the efficiency of the baseload system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in New South Wales some of the best coal in the world in terms of energy density. The only thing that's better than it is uranium, which is very energy dense, but using that for electricity in Australia is banned. So we rely on coal. But our power stations are very old. In New South Wales, they are all subcritical power stations—1970s and even 1960s technology that are using up their designed lifespans. There are some ultrasupercritical ones in Queensland, and many countries in Asia are switching to using our black energy-dense coal to produce cheap electricity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our black coal in the Hunter Valley, which I visited on the weekend, compared to Indonesian coal produces 30 per cent less CO2. Compared to Indian coal, it's 70 per cent less. That's an amazing difference. By India burning our black coal, they're reducing their carbon footprint by 70 per cent. By Indonesia burning our black coal, they're reducing their footprint by 30 per cent. We're exporting our greatest competitive advantage. It's our biggest earner at the moment along with iron ore. What I'm saying is that we could get both outcomes. We could get the environmental outcome we're all seeking if we utilised our black energy-dense coal in ultrasupercritical, highly efficient, low-emissions power stations, which need to be built for us to meet our targets. If we did that and we built them in Victoria, you'd get a 43 per cent reduction, because they use brown coal, which is a lot moister and has a lot more CO2 and things like that in it. But if we built a modern power station, we'd get a 43 per cent reduction. If you use carbon capture and storage, you could reduce it by 90 per cent, but we would be getting cheap energy around the clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the weekend, we had a heatwave. In New South Wales, 80 per cent of the energy during that heatwave came from four old power stations. If we don't replace them, the lights will go out. It's also the case that in the morning and in the night, the lights won't go on. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Everyone agrees that we are managing the health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis well in Australia. However, it's a far different story when it comes to the economic recession we are in. If one just looks at the reports of a booming stock market and surging property prices, you could be fooled into thinking we are back to normal. Nothing could be further from the truth. For a significant and growing proportion of our community, their circumstances are very grim. They are much grimmer, in fact, than at the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last fortnight, I've had the privilege to visit some wonderful organisations who are helping the growing number of vulnerable people in Shortland. Many of my constituents might be surprised that there are foodbanks and distribution centres in our community. I acknowledge and pay tribute to the wonderful volunteers at Belmont Community Kitchen, OzHarvest at Windale, Manor House, Survivor's R Us and Southlake Marketplace for the truly magnificent work they do in my community. At this time of year, particularly in this recession, many, many people are doing it tough, and these wonderful organisations supported by wonderful volunteers make an immeasurable impact and difference to the lives of so many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the feedback I receive from the foodbank managers was very disturbing. Their clients are facing a much more difficult situation than six months ago. This is due to the government's cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. There are 1.6 million Australians relying on the JobSeeker unemployment support, with the government predicting another 200,000 will be added to that list by the end of the year. There are a further 1.5 million Australians on JobKeeper. Locally, we have about 8,000 JobSeeker recipients and an estimated 17,000 who depend upon JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly 30 per cent of all Shortland residents aged between 15 and 65 depend upon one of these payments that the government has cut. Ann-Maria from Survivor's R Us at Cardiff told me that at the height of the lockdown they were providing food packages to around 150 families a week. They have seen a spike in demand since the government's cuts to JobSeeker and JobKeeper were implemented in late September. They are now providing packages to over 450 families per week. Just reflect upon that for a moment: demand from families in danger of starving tripled at exactly the same time this government cut JobKeeper and JobSeeker. This is no coincidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I received similar evidence from Christine from Southlake Marketplace at the southern end of Shortland. Christine was literally in tears as she explained the massive surge in demand for their food parcels. Southlake Marketplace were assisting 400 families at the height of the COVID lockdown. Immediately after the September cuts, this surged to around a thousand families in need of assistance to have enough food. In other words, the demand for help with the basics of life is at 250 per cent because of the government's cuts. Christine also made the point that they cannot currently meet the demand for Christmas hampers and toys for families and kids in our area. She was distraught at the thought of turning away families, meaning kids would not receive a Christmas present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've organised for my electorate office to be a drop-off point for toys, but so much more needs to be done. Families in my community are hurting because of the deliberate decisions of this Liberal-National government. Let me repeat that: the cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker are a deliberate act of cruelty by this craven, out-of-touch government. This cruelty means thousands of families in my community will be at risk of starvation without the intervention of the charities I mentioned previously. I do not make this claim lightly, but the evidence is obvious. The cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker are a deliberate act of cruelty by this government. The government has chosen to cut JobKeeper and JobSeeker at the worst possible time. Removing much needed support to those who need it most is bad economics and disgusting social policy, and it is a damning indictment on this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To make matters worse, we're hearing stories of families being evicted from their homes. This is despite the eviction moratorium being officially extended by the New South Wales government. Loan deferrals have also been ended by many banks, meaning those families with mortgages are also facing grim circumstances. We are seeing a tsunami of housing stress coming down the road for so many Australians, and it's made much worse by the cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. For many, not only are they struggling to put food on their table but they are struggling to keep a roof over their head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the government to stop these cuts, which will go deep in the New Year, to ensure that families in my electorate can have food on the table and a roof over their heads. One of the key lessons of this pandemic is that government has a fundamentally critical role to play in society, and they have the power to not only support citizens in tough times but to transform their lives for the better. This government should avoid those cuts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  Over 1,000 veterans live in my electorate of Curtin. As the home of the SAS regiment at the Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne, we also have hundreds of current serving men and women and their families. Our vets and Defence Force men and women are a vital part of our community. Their kids go to our schools; their partners work in, and support, our local businesses and volunteer at not-for-profits and sporting clubs. They step up in times of national disaster. They are our neighbours. They are our friends. They are not separate. They are us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, it's not surprising that the Brereton report into Afghanistan has impacted many within my electorate, and I have been contacted by many people who have wanted to express their anger, their dismay and their concern. No-one contests that the allegations against a small number of people involved with the SAS, which are detailed in the report, are extremely disturbing. No-one contests that justice must be done and that those who have allegedly acted criminally on the battlefield or who didn't act in accordance with the standards expected of them must be held to account through our legal system and must, if found guilty, be duly punished. But there is enormous concern, anger and dismay that all are being tarred with the same brush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two major concerns have been shared with me. The first is the recommendation to strip all 3,000-plus Special Operations Task Group members of the Meritorious Unit Citation. To punish and denigrate all for the actions of a few is not, in my reckoning, fair and it certainly does not serve justice. Rather, it is an injustice to all those who served with honour. It's wrong. The second concern is that the leadership appears to have been exonerated from all responsibility, which is anathema to the principles of the chain of command, responsibility and authority upon which the defence forces are built. This apparent exoneration is even more inflammatory, given that it has been done in the context of the recommendation to strip 3,000 serving members of their citation. Let us not forget that the Special Operations Task Group members sacrificed so much. Many came home traumatised, physically and mentally harmed. Some didn't come home at all. And many others have suicided since or self-harmed. They served with honour and integrity, and we must not forget that or allow those sacrifices to be denigrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard about one vet who spent 10 years serving and was deployed to Afghanistan numerous times. He feels that his service has been demeaned, insulted and viewed as worthless. He feels that he wasted 10 years of his life—and missed half of his children's lives—for nothing. This is wrong. Let us also not forget the sacrifices made by the families of our defence personnel, often living transient lives and, in the words of one mother, spending the time during their deployment 'trying not to think about what was happening to my son and praying for his safe return'. I know some of these families, and I know firsthand that, despite the sacrifices they endure, they don't moan, whinge or complain. In fact, they are often the very first people to put their hands up to help other people in need in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must avoid at all costs a situation where our defence forces are universally demonised, where they are considered a monolithic, indistinguishable group to which we can give some generalised characterisation or label—because they are not. They are individual men and women who serve and sacrifice for us. Ultimately, it must never be us versus them because they are us. And, just as they step up every time we need them, so we should step up now when they need us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Today I want to talk about four outstanding citizens of my great electorate of Franklin. These four citizens are Tasmanian Australian of the Year Award winners, who will go to the national final on Australia Day in 2021. Given what a remarkable year it has been both in Australia and around the world, I think that these four Tasmanians deserve particular attention and particular focus and so I wanted to mention them in the parliament today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is Tasmanian Australian of the Year Grace Tame. People may know that Grace has been very active in the #LetHerSpeak campaign. Grace is an incredibly brave advocate for survivors of sexual assault, especially those that were abused in institutional settings. Indeed, she very bravely talks about how, from age 15, she was groomed by a 58-year-old maths teacher, who has since been charged and has gone to jail for his crime, as he rightly should. Grace has been very brave and very powerful in advocating for the rights of survivors to stand up and tell their side of the story publicly should they so choose and to encourage survivors and show survivors that there is a way forward. She is a truly extraordinary Australian and Tasmanian and I want to wish her all the best at the awards next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next is Brian Williams. Brian, who is also from my electorate, is the Tasmanian Senior Australian of the Year. He's been part of the Scouting movement in Tasmania for more than 15 years. Indeed, he's been a stalwart at the Blackmans Bay Scout Group the whole time that I have been a federal member of parliament—the whole 13 years. It's been a real privilege to work with Brian and his team at the Blackmans Bay Scout Group in trying to get small grants and to assist the scouting groups in the local community. Indeed, we got them a Stronger Communities grant in the last round. The Blackmans Bay Scouts are renowned in southern Tasmania for selling Christmas trees on the side of the road in December to try to raise funds for their scouting group. They're a very active group. I want to wish Brian the best for the Senior Australian of the Year awards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Edna Pennicott, who was named Tasmanian Australia's Local Hero, is an absolute gem of a woman who is in the south of my electorate, in Kingston. Edna founded her own charity, Kingborough Helping Hands, in 2013 to assist people doing it tough in the Kingborough area. This is an area which was traditionally seen as reasonably middle-class and wealthy, but she knew that there were a lot of residents in this local area who were doing it incredibly tough. She's been volunteering for her local community for 40 years. I also wish Edna all the very best next year. The last one is Toby Thorpe. He is Tasmanian Young Australian of the Year. He's been a very strong advocate for climate change for many, many years. I also wish him the very best. These are four outstanding Tasmanians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise to speak about some incredible young achievers in the electorate of Ryan. Each year I run the Young Leadership Award, where local schools put forward students who have gone above and beyond and excelled themselves. This year, more than ever, has been a difficult year for these students, and their leadership amongst their peers has been even more important. So it is a great pleasure to recognise them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start with Ameya from Brigidine College. As a Youth Champion of the Queensland Family and Child Commission, Ameya has done fantastic work amongst her peers. She works with other youth, providing consultation and action plans for kids on topics such as drugs, alcohol and sex education. Her focus on young families is absolutely commendable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Millie Kent, also at Brigidine College, in year 11, has done a terrific job as well. She is part of the college's Environment Club, raising awareness of recycling and sustainability. She is in the Justice and Democracy Group and also works for the St Vincent de Paul Society. Millie participated in the Peer Skills Program training workshop and is now a peer mentor to her fellow students. During such a tough year, her efforts amongst her cohort have been outstanding. Well done, Millie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Malia Knox, who is in year 3 at Milton State School, is an incredible young woman. She is only in year 3, but she went out and identified a deficit among women in the form of statues, pictures, plaques and representations of the wonderful work that women do in our community. She started the #FemaleFaces4PublicPlaces campaign and worked with her local politician to improve female recognition in our local area. Tahlia Wyllie, from year 8 at Ferny Grove State High School, is a member of the Dreamcatcher program, which inspires leaders who desire to develop their leadership skills. She is an up-and-comer within the Ferny Grove State High School cohort and her leadership skills were greatly appreciated amongst her peers this year. She's also a keen fundraiser with the Sanfilippo Children's Foundation, raising over $239,000 for the foundation. Cassidy Ratcliff, a year 11 student at Ferny Grove State High School is president of the school's Interact team. In 2020, Cassidy facilitated the Easter-egg drive, raising much needed donations for the children's hospital and, on Easter Sunday, shared among the young patients some much needed hope and enjoyment. Harry Colen, from year 6 at The Gap State High School, is a fantastic leader in his local community. He's a keen environmentalist and a keen fisherman who's taking practical action to remove pest fish from his local waterways. I congratulate him. Josh Ho, in year 10 at The Gap State High School, stepped up in a big way in a difficult year for all students. He supported his peers, particularly in IT, which is one of his passions. Thank you for all the support of your fellow students as well this year, Josh. Great work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Today I raise some of the shocking conditions facing staff and patients at the only public hospital in the Greater Blacktown area, Blacktown Hospital. Like many locals, I was born in Blacktown Hospital. It's central to the safety and liveability of our community. That's why, like so many other local residents, I was shocked by recent revelations aired in the media relating to the treatment and resourcing of staff, particularly within the obstetrics ward, and the heartbreaking accounts of the deaths of babies at the hospital. The sheer grief of their parents and families who are failed is unbearable to read. A decision was recently made by the Blacktown branch of the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association to take industrial action, stopping work on Thursday 19 November. It was a decision that was not taken lightly. They were ordered back to work the next morning, but it sent a very powerful message that the medical staff and allied health professionals who keep our hospitals running have been taken for granted for far too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with some of the nurses and midwives from the hospital. They are passionate people who love what they do, but they are angry, and rightfully so, as they are continually left understaffed in one of the fastest-growing areas in all of Greater Sydney. They recounted stories of missing out on time with their families because they needed to do overtime to plug gaps in the roster and they didn't want to let their colleagues down and leave them alone. They described situations in which non-specialist nurses and midwives were ordered to work in some of the most high-pressure environments, including for premature and complicated births, despite not having the formal training to do so. Horrifyingly, they told me it was common to be perpetually dehydrated, to not drink anything in the lead-up to a shift or during a shift to avoid having to take a bathroom break when they are so cripplingly understaffed. The fasting practices often continue into their shifts. We expect our healthcare professionals to observe the highest level of medical integrity, to be ready to respond to anything and everything, and yet this government isn't even affording them the dignity to be able to eat and drink throughout their shifts due to current staffing measures. It is an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently wrote to the New South Wales Minister for Health, seeking an urgent briefing on the steps being taken by the New South Wales government to address these very disturbing issues. I'm yet to receive a response. While I welcome the Western Sydney Local Health District's commitment to hiring six to 10 obstetricians to address staffing shortfalls, I remain concerned that this will not be enough to address the demand caused by our growing population. I will continue to monitor this issue closely and advocate strongly for the staff and patients of Blacktown Hospital. This should not be happening. In a developed and prosperous nation like ours, this sort of maladministration is simply not on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  There are close to 15 kilometres of beautiful beach land marking the western boundary of my electorate of Curtin. From the flag poles at Scarborough Beach to just south of the Cottesloe Groin, you can't find a better stretch of coastline anywhere in the world. Because of the remarkable work done by leader botanist, Professor Kinglsey Dixon, we know that the Perth coastline has an amazing biodiversity. His book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Coastal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lants</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a guide to the identification and restoratio</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n of plants of the Perth region</span>, identifies 128 of the most common plants along the coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to identifying the amazing biosecurity, Professor Dixon has also been instrumental in helping us to recognise the ecological vulnerability of the coast and has been involved for decades in both research and local community efforts to preserve and protect the natural environment. One of those local community initiatives that Professor Dixon was a founding member of is Cambridge Coastcare. Cambridge Coastcare commenced in March 1999, following a call from the town of Cambridge in 1998 for interest in people to establish a coast-care organisation to assist with the managing, monitoring, and protection of the environment and recreational values of the coastline in the town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being incorporated, Cambridge Coastcare has managed $400,000 in grants for coastal projects, mainly to protect the natural dune system with planting of local native plants, fencing and monitoring. This coastline is 4.8 kilometres long and not only has some of the best natural dune systems in the Perth metro area but is also listed as one of the 55 hotspots susceptible to coastal erosion. This is of concern because it's recognised that the stability of the dune system provides a cost-effective, natural defence mechanism against the hazards of sand drift, intrusion of waves, wind and salt spray. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cambridge Coastcare currently has 65 members, including 20 family memberships. As I discovered last week when I had the opportunity to visit, these are passionate people, who pay to belong to Coastcare and then volunteer their time to weed, plant and, as I discovered last week, erect fences. Their current project aims to restore vegetation cover for the dunes fronting Floreat Surf Life Saving Club. This year's winter storms, rough seas and high water levels—the combined result of a storm surge, tide and swell direction—washed away the front of the dunes by one to two metres, leaving potentially dangerous sand cliffs in some places. This erosion poses a threat to public safety and threatens to destabilise these popular coastal assets, so fencing has been erected. The design is to build up the natural sand in the winter season to enable planting next year. Thank you, Ivo Davies, Meg Anklesaria and all volunteers at Cambridge Coastcare for the work that you do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  There are 50 schools in Moreton, but one in particular always brings a smile to my face when I visit and that school is Milpera. Milpera has a special place not only in Moreton but in the greater Brisbane region. It is a state high school that educates the children of refugees and migrants, and is essentially Brisbane's intensive English language preparation centre. Milpera provides quality education for newly arrived children from Vietnam, many South American countries, the former Yugoslavia, Africa, the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Asia—anywhere basically. It aims to facilitate good settlement and a strong sense of belonging to Australia through carefully chosen learning experiences. Students learn to thrive in an Australian classroom at the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The teachers at Milpera are very experienced and are qualified to teach English as an additional language. The student centred curriculum uses highly contextualised language learning experiences and ensures that students develop the English language needed for their future learning pathways in whatever school they choose. It also has a great volunteer team. Children spend about 18 months at Milpera, on average, before they can attend a school closer to their home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to Milpera for their NAIDOC celebrations and had a quick talk with the acting principal, Julie Peel. She introduced me to two students, Ang and Rachel. Ang had arrived from Vietnam and Rachel from France via Canada. They took me through a PowerPoint presentation they had prepared to build an argument and convince the audience of their point of view. They had a carefully structured argument and provided well-researched evidence to support their points of view in their new language, English. I joined in the NAIDOC Week celebrations and it was wonderful to hear the voices of our oldest living culture speaking to our newest voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Irrespective of where Ang's and Rachel's ancestral villages are or where my ancestral village is, which I guess is somewhere in France, Italy or Ireland, we know that where we stand is where we make a stand. The earth feeds our heart, where we are standing now. Ang and Rachel obviously had great affection for where they came from but a loyalty to here. That is the story of every Australian, whether you are First Nations people or the rest. To tell people that we can't serve two masters, which is what some people have suggested, starts with the assumption that Australians are servants. Australians are never servants. The free serve no-one. The good people help all, but they serve nobody. So thank you to Ang and Rachel. Thank you to Milpera for another wonderful educational experience. Thank you again. As I mentioned, there is an incredible volunteer army that helps out Milpera: retired teachers, retired principals, local community members from the Graceville and Chelmer area who turn up at Milpera and help these people that come from all around the world to become passionate Australians. Well done, Milpera. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:45</span>):  We get to meet extraordinary some people in our roles as federal members of parliament, but some people leave you profoundly affected and inspired to achieve more. I'd like to share a story of courage and bravery, not from a soldier or an extreme sports person but from someone from North Lakes in my electorate who is a single mother of two boys. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine that one minute you're working as a lawyer, worrying about packing lunches and driving your children to and from school, and now you're learning to navigate around the furniture in your house with a cane. This was Jenny Kramaric's reality in 2014. Her optic nerve was dying and the world around her was getting darker. I met Jenny at the annual Guide Dogs Queensland graduation ceremony last week. She was kind enough to allow me to share her story with you today, from feeling scared, alone and too anxious to walk out her door some days, to now regularly volunteering at her boys' schools. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her life and the life of her sons was changed when she was perfectly matched to her seeing eye dog, Layla, six months ago. Jenny told me that Layla has taken away barriers for her. It has given her a second chance at living her best life. She feels unstoppable and better as a mum for it. She helps at the sports carnivals and volunteers with children learning to read at The Lakes College and Grace College. She says everyone wants to learn to read with the blind mum. Thanks to the NDIS and an incredible Israeli device that attaches a microcamera to her glasses and speaks the pages to her through an earpiece, she knows exactly when the child gets a word wrong. She said Layla has given her boys, Sebastian and Nicholas, breathing space to enjoy life. They were constantly worrying about their mum, but now they see her overcoming adversity and being positive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that Guide Dogs does at its Bald Hills facility and around Australia is life saving. It costs roughly $50,000 to breed, raise and train a seeing eye dog like Layla. Each dog is expertly matched to its handler, with consideration given to the speed of the dog and its temperament for the household it is needed in. It's an exhausting but hugely rewarding process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People like Jenny are living brave and courageous lives amongst us. I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet her and others. They say courage is contagious, and I challenge anyone who meets Jenny not to be inspired.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:48</span>):  Thursday 26 November marked exactly one year since the Currowan bushfire was ignited. This bushfire would go on to devastate my electorate on the New South Wales South Coast, burning for 74 days. It took lives and destroyed homes and livelihoods. All of this year's challenges began with the Currowan bushfire. On Thursday I wanted to go back and speak with some of the impacted people I had met in those early days to see how they were going. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited beekeeper Vince and his wife Maria at their farm in Yatte Yattah. Vince and Maria had lost hundreds of their bees in the bushfire. They feared they would lose so many more with their food––the bush––almost completely gone. I helped Vince and Maria navigate the complex system of grants and loans, a quagmire for them at the time. Much of what they needed didn't fit with the guidelines, and it was challenging to get the help they needed. Last week, they proudly showed me some of the equipment they had purchased with their grants, and they let me taste the honey they had produced. It was fantastic to see. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat down with Katrina and Ken outside the rebuild of their home in Conjola Park. Their strength is admirable, and it was lovely to sit down at the same picnic table where I met them in the weeks after the fire with a very different view. It hasn't been an easy road. They told me about the struggles with their insurance company and struggles with the government's small-business bushfire loans and with access to the HomeBuilder scheme, about being asked to tell their story over and over and being asked to value their house that doesn't exist—being asked too much for people who have been to hell and back. But the smile has never left their faces. They say they are the lucky ones. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also stopped by the Club Malua, the heart of Malua Bay, to chat with club chairperson Dennis about rebuilding plans. The club was lost in the bushfires on New Year's Eve, but it hasn't stopped them. They have been operating out of a very sophisticated marquee. The bowling greens are as busy as ever, and they are excited about what the future holds. I was even given my very own Malua Bay bowling shirt, so next time I am down there I'll be one of the team. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this year has been tough, it has also brought out the best in us. Our community stepped up in their time of need, and the truth is we have each and every member of our community to thank for getting us through. I have never been prouder to call the South Coast home.</span>

Recipients of the order of St John long-service medal included Malcolm Knight, who served for 35 years; Condy Kwan and Lachlan Liao, 20 years; Linda Xu, 15 years; Kirsten Burghard and Nicole Simon, 10 years; Benjamin Mead and Andrea Scenna, five years; and Daynah Nash and Eloise Riviere, three years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Premier of New South Wales Bushfire Emergency Citation is a new award established this year by the Premier to recognise the outstanding contribution of volunteers and service agency personnel who played a significant role in the emergency response effort to combat the 2019-20 bushfires. St John Ambulance volunteers tirelessly worked during the 2019-20 bushfires with many being deployed to various evacuation centres providing medical services. The Premier's citation is an award that recognises their efforts. Recipients of the 2019-20 bushfire citations were Pierre Baudou-Daniel, Kirsten Burghard, Rachel Chapman, Samantha Davis, Marco Franse, Callum Gray, Malcolm Knight, Lachlan Liao and Daynah Nash.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth noting this year that many St John Ambulance volunteers have also served on the front line during COVID at testing clinics and hotels, and checking temperatures at events. Volunteer recognition awards were given to Patrick Gibb, Amanullah Haidary, David James, Michelle Ly, Emma Mead, Melissa Ng, Aidan O'Sullivan, Adelene Ong, Anthony Salole, Kathryn Scott, Divyansh Sharma, Andrea Sono, Richard Wessen and Tiffany Willis. </span>

Congratulations to Jia Dong, Anna Hannselmann, Bailey Chapman, Jie Yi Choong, Mika Kato, Abby Kidston, Tiana Kim, Crystal Li, Xiao Marshall-Taylor, Vanessa Tan, Katrina Thorvaldson, Roy Zhou and Stanley Zhou. On behalf of everyone in the Berowra electorate, congratulations to everyone in St John Ambulance.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I've recently been spending time visiting those living in public housing in my electorate and I am dismayed that many in my electorate are living in conditions that wouldn't be acceptable in the private rental market. I recently visited Peter in Morphett Vale and he told me that he'd been waiting five years for water damage in his public housing property to be fixed. While he waits, the lower cabinets in the kitchen are completely unusable and he has to resort to storing food and cooking equipment in his dining room. The damp is a health hazard and has attracted vermin. While I was there a large cockroach scuttled along the bottom of the cupboards, despite it being clear. Peter's house was otherwise clean and tidy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many stories like Peter's. Twenty-five per cent of Australians in public housing are waiting for maintenance issues to be addressed. In my home state of South Australia, 15,000 public housing homes are waiting for maintenance. Another example of tenants who have been waiting a long time for works to be carried out are Michael and Midge from Hackham. They noticed a strong mould smell in their public house over a year ago. There was clearly an issue, and it was exacerbating Michael's respiratory conditions. It took coming to my office for help out of sheer desperation that led them to finally having a water pipe that was leaking beneath the kitchen floor fixed. Unfortunately, the job isn't finished. They've been left with safety hazards, with their cupboards propped up by wood and their floor left unfinished and uneven. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw a similar story when I visited Vicky in Old Reynella. When works are carried out, they do not seem to be done completely, and the public housing authority only paid for half. For example, there was water damage and mould caused by drainage issues in her home. They were addressed, but only half the bathroom was tiled. The state government only paid for half the bathroom to be tiled, so there were two sets of tiles in the same bathroom. Vicky takes a lot of pride in her home, and the maintenance issues she is having should be addressed and shouldn't have caused this amount of angst. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many stories that I could go on and on and on. At a time when we're in a recession, where stimulus could occur by fixing these important issues, the government has ignored them. The state government has ignored them, and the federal government has ignored them. What do they have in common? They're Liberal Party governments. The Liberal Party does not care about the very desperate situation that so many people in social housing are facing. I urge the government to take up Labor's idea of investing in repairs in public housing to stimulate our economy. Not only will it be good for those living in public housing; it will be good for tradies as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  Warren Buffett, also known as the 'Oracle of Omaha', the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is considered to be one of the world's most successful investors, with over 70 years of industry experience. However, if he were to come to Australia, as at 12.01 am on 1 January 2021, he would be banned from giving any investment advice unless he first passed the government's qualification exam. Further, he would also be banned, as at the end of 2025, unless at 90 years of age he'd gone back to university and completed eight units of study and passed those exams. Otherwise, he would be forced into retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such legislation, such red tape, is an absolute nonsense. Yes, we want to try and do more to clean up our financial industry, and we founded the royal commission. But to impose retrospective study requirements on people with 20, 25, 30 and 35 years of industry experience and have that count for nothing—to force someone in their 60s to go back to university to do eight units of study, otherwise, 'Sorry, you're out of the industry'—such legislation is a nonsense. I'm sure people on both sides of the House understand this. I'm sure we all have highly qualified, highly reputable people in the financial industry saying to us, 'Unless this legislation is changed, I will be forced out of the industry.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few simple and quick changes that we could make to avoid this. Firstly, we need to exempt anyone with 25 years of industry experience without any black marks against their name from having to do the exam. Secondly, all of the 500 exam questions, of which 70 are rotated for each exam, should be published on a website with what are deemed to be the correct answers. Let's have some transparency in this so that people know what the questions are, can study all 500 of them and can look to see what the answers are. Finally, we need to make sure that we recognise industry experience. So my suggestion is that we start at 12 years of industry experience and, after 12 years, for every additional three years you get one exemption of the units of study you must do. Therefore, we are not going to say to someone with 25 years of industry experience who is in their late 50s or 60s, 'We are going to force you back to university if you want to continue your career.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scrutiny of government spending to get maximum value for every dollar is now more important than ever, given Australia's budget deficit is now at a record high and government spending has blown out under this mob to the highest percentage of GDP since 1970, which is as far back as you can go in the budget papers. So, while this motion might sound nerdy and niche, it really matters. Sticking up for the Auditor-General should not be controversial, and the motion simply reaffirms the importance of the Auditor-General and calls on the government to reverse its budget cuts and stop taking revenge on the Audit Office for doing their job well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Auditor-General is a critical part of the Commonwealth's integrity architecture. It turns the blowtorch on government expenditure and performance, and it's made even more important by the government's complete failure to introduce a national integrity commission. Indeed, the Audit Office is one of the few independent watchdogs with real teeth to scrutinise government performance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It'll never be always comfortable for any government, but most audits are uncontroversial. Every now and again a scandal emerges, but, generally, that's not common, except under this Liberal government. They're rife with graft. There have been the sports rorts, where hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds were funnelled to Liberal Party marginal seats in a dodgy process in the minister's office. There have been airport land rorts. They paid $30 million for land worth $3 million. Liberal mates have run riot in ASIC, racking up bills and personal expenses. Billions of dollars have been wasted on consultant mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxpayers rely on the Auditor-General to uncover waste and misuse of public money, but to do his job the Auditor-General must be properly funded. The ANAO's budget has been in structural deficit for years because of this government's cuts, budget after budget. He recorded unsustainable losses over the last two years of $3.1 million and 4.8 million. So the Auditor-General wrote to the Prime Minister requesting $6.3 million in new funding in his budget just so he could keep doing his job. Disgracefully, instead of giving the Auditor-General the funding he needs, the Prime Minister took more revenge and made more cuts to the ANAO, getting his own back for sports rorts—a $1.28 million cut to revenue, a reduction in overall resources of $14 million and another cut to staffing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The oldest trick in the book of governments worldwide who want to shut down scrutiny is to starve the integrity agencies of funds. The Prime Minister has the result he wanted: the number of performance audits will now fall well below the longstanding bipartisan target of about 48 per year, which has been there under successive governments, to about 38—a 20 per cent cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, in question time, has tried to spin the issue and has said, 'Oh, well. It's not really a deliberate plan. His resourcing will be considered in the 10-year review by the JCPAA.' That is ridiculous and misleading. That's a 10-year review of the Auditor-General's legislation, not of his budget; that's the government's responsibility. Only the Prime Minister and the government can give the Audit Office more money. That's in the Constitution. The committee can't give him more money; only the government can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, make no mistake, this is just the latest attack on the ANAO. Since the Liberals were elected over seven years ago, the Auditor-General's budget, as of this year, has been cut by 18.3 per cent in real terms, and, shockingly, this latest nasty little budget bakes in more cuts. Four years from now, the ANAO's budget will have been cut by 22.1 per cent in real terms since the marketing department over there was elected to government. They're not my figures; that's the Parliamentary Library's analysis. But it's not a matter of money. They're racking up $1 trillion dollars of Liberal debt but they pretend they can't find $6.7 million for the Audit Office. That is a false economy if ever there was one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sustained attack on democracy. It is trying to avoid scrutiny and accountability for the Liberals' own rorts, waste, pork-barrelling and graft. I call on the government to immediately reverse its cuts to the Auditor-General's budget. This should not be a partisan issue. If the government fails to restore funding to the ANAO before the next election, then I believe the opposition of which I am a member must commit to doing so, because integrity matters. I also call out Liberal government members of the JCPAA. I see the chair of the JCPAA here. I get on well with the chair, but I really call out the Liberal government members of the JCPAA for not standing up. Where have they been out there publicly defending the Auditor-General, doing their job as an audit committee, and sticking up for the independent Audit Office? It's just not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that the Prime Minister has proven that he can't be trusted to protect the Auditor-General, it's time that the parliament took the ANAO off him, took it out of his portfolio. We should legislate to establish the Audit Office as a parliamentary department, cementing the Auditor-General as a truly independent officer of the parliament, just like the Parliamentary Budget Officer or the Clerk. Frankly, I'd trust the Speaker and the President of the Senate more than I'd trust this Prime Minister to stick up for the Auditor-General.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I thank the member for Bruce for the opportunity to discuss the role that the Auditor-General plays in our democracy. Despite a personal friendship, there are many areas on which the member for Bruce and I do not always agree, but the importance of the Auditor-General and the work of the Australian National Audit Office is one area on which we most certainly agree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANAO's work in auditing Commonwealth entities assists in ensuring accountability and transparency, helping to improve public governance and administration. As chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I have seen firsthand the ANAO's valuable work in providing reports to the parliament that assist in improving the accountability, efficiency and effectiveness of government. I want to place on record my appreciation for the role that the Auditor-General and the ANAO play and the important work they do. The JCPAA has had a long tradition of operating as a bipartisan committee to support and protect the independence of the ANAO, and I take the activities of this committee seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also outlines issues regarding the ANAO's budget. Under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act, the JCPAA is required to consider the draft budget estimates of the ANAO and make recommendations to both houses of parliament. As the member for Bruce is aware, the committee made a statement on budget day expressing its view on the 2020-21 draft budget estimates and made representations, as is appropriate, to advocate its position. However, this statement is not the end of the JCPAA's input into the ANAO's budget. On 2 September 2020, the committee began an inquiry into the Auditor-General Act, which includes consideration of resourcing arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Prime Minister referred specifically to this review in the House earlier this year and said that the government would consider future ANAO funding in the context of its response to that review. The Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a 10-year review currently underway into the ANAO and what their resourcing requirements are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… when the government receives the outcomes of that 10-year review, we will consider the resourcing for the ANAO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The terms of reference for this inquiry will look at many of the issues and concerns raised by the member for Bruce in this motion, including the examination of governance frameworks, the independence of the ANAO, information gathering powers and the interaction of legislative frameworks. The review will also look at the Auditor-General's capacity to initiate audits, the accessibility and transparency of audits and audit conclusions, the audit priorities of the parliament and the role and appointment of the independent auditor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also argues that the ANAO should become a parliamentary department, inferring there could be potential conflicts created by the current structure. But the Auditor-General and the ANAO already have statutory independence from government in the work they conduct. The motion seems to suggest a connection between the ANAO operating within the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio and that the ANAO didn't receive the supplementary funding that it requested in the 2020-21 budget. This would also appear to conflate the issues. For instance, the Parliamentary Budget Office, which is a parliamentary department, also requested and also didn't receive the supplementary funding it requested as part of the recent budget. However, ultimately, these broader issues are matters for the JCPAA to consider in their 10-year review of the Auditor-General's Act, and I would certainly welcome further consideration of these matters throughout the inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bruce raised the need for a national integrity commission in this motion. Preventing corrupt, criminal behaviour in the public sector is an important issue and one the government is taking strong action on. The Morrison government has released a consultation draft of legislation to create a Commonwealth integrity body for the federal public sector. This draft legislation will ensure the new body has appropriate resources and powers to investigate allegations of criminal conduct and will be led by an integrity commissioner. The model proposed builds on lessons learnt from state integrity bodies and strikes a balance between the need to protect individual rights, and the need to prevent and target wrongdoing at the Commonwealth level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government will continue to ensure the highest level of integrity within the Commonwealth public sector. I know that the JCPAA will also continue its work in upholding the independence of the ANAO and, through the 10-year review process, look to strengthen existing governance frameworks to facilitate the important work of the Auditor-General and the ANAO. I look forward to working with the member for Bruce on this very important inquiry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I thank the member for Bruce for moving this important motion. I was elected to represent the people of Dunkley with vigour and integrity. I'm proud to be a parliamentarian and I'm proud to represent the people of Dunkley. But like many, many people in my community, and I must say many people who are also privileged to be members of this parliament, I am deeply concerned about the state of politics and the way that politics has been played, eroding and corroding the community's trust in democracy and government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before this pandemic, fewer than half of all Australians were satisfied with the way democracy worked, and trust in government had suffered a 20-year slide from 48 per cent to 26 per cent. While it is true that some of that decline has been halted during the pandemic because of the way the opposition and the government have, in many instances, put cudgels aside and worked together for public health matters, we are only seeing green shoots. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, some of the growing belief in the public that perhaps politicians can work together for the greater good has been undermined over and over again because we have a Prime Minister and a government that not only continue to be embroiled in scandal after scandal but refuse to take responsibility for those scandals. We have a Prime Minister who has constantly denigrated and undermined this national parliament by calling it 'a bubble', who shuts down debate on topics he doesn't like, who refuses to release reports or answer questions that don't suit his agenda and who ignores long-held conventions and protocols. This is a government which has undermined the trust of the Australian people by treating the privilege of being elected to parliament and forming a government as a political plaything, where the interests that it serves are too often its own and not those of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the budget, the Auditor-General wrote to the government requesting $6.3 million in new funding so he could continue to undertake his essential role in scrutiny of government spending and programs. There are accumulated budget pressures, there is spending because of COVID-19, there is a trillion dollars in debt and this is one of the highest accumulated spending governments in history. We have seen the Auditor-General's work firsthand uncover the way this government has treated public money as its plaything. We have seen the sports rorts scandal, which is not over. We have seen the Leppington Triangle. We know what allegations have been made about water buybacks on the Murray-Darling Basin. We know how important the Auditor-General is but, despite the fact that the ANAO has been in structural deficit for years because of the government's cuts and the Auditor-General has asked for more money, this Prime Minister, this Treasurer and this government have failed to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that we have a government that has wanted to talk the talk about integrity but just simply hasn't delivered. The Australian public have been waiting for years for the Prime Minister's announcement about a national integrity commission to turn into delivery. We must have a national integrity commission, one with teeth, one which has the power to investigate sitting members of parliament, government agencies and government departments, if we are to even come close to restoring that 20-year decline in faith in the public sector. We have a government that apparently has decided that the Westminster system of responsibility doesn't apply to it anymore. Robodebt must be one of the greatest public policy failings ever seen in Australia, where, in order to fix the budget deficit, a government has preyed on the vulnerable in society that it is here to represent. In most other Western democracies that purport to follow the Westminster system, the government would have fallen over robodebt. But we don't even have one minister willing to put up his—because they are men—hand to take responsibility, including the Prime Minister, who started this entire shameful chapter in Australia's public policy history. We need integrity. We need it now more than ever, and the government needs to step up and deliver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  This has been a truly appalling year for transparency in this country, and the community is demanding to know: what else have politicians got to hide? For instance, we've had the Clover Moore fake document saga; sports rorts; the outrageous price paid for Leppington Triangle; Cartier watches; and the ASIC chairman's massive tax bill. Honestly, it's no wonder that the community's trust in the government and in our institutions is at an all-time low. And now, rather than addressing all this dodgy behaviour, the government has gone and cut the funding of the Australian National Audit Office even further, even though it's the very agency tasked to scrutinise government spending of taxpayers' money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For heaven's sake, surely independent oversight of this nature is a fundamental pillar of a good democracy, and just as surely the ANAO has demonstrated time and time again the important work it does. Remember, it was the National Audit Office that uncovered the shameless pork-barrelling of coalition seats using community sports programs, and only last month the Auditor-General referred the Leppington Triangle deal to the Australian Federal Police after the Commonwealth paid a thumping $30 million for a piece of land worth just three million bucks. No wonder, I suppose, that the Audit Office is in the government's sights and has lost nearly a fifth of its funding since the coalition came to power. It seems secrecy is in their DNA, which also goes to explain the government's woefully inadequate federal integrity body.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, that will be a toothless tiger. For instance, it will not conduct public hearings into allegations of corruption and it won't be able to report or make public findings of corruption. Moreover, there is no remit to look at conflicts of interest and it will rely on self-referrals by MPs. Even worse, it will actively discourage whistleblowers, because Public Service whistleblowers would risk being turned away or even prosecuted for making allegations, even if they have a reasonable suspicion of corruption. Frankly, we'd be better off with nothing rather than this appallingly designed integrity agency. No. What we need is a powerful independent body that can hold public hearings, make findings of guilt, lean on a broad definition of corruption and accept referrals from any member of the community. In other words, we need an integrity agency that actually has the resources and powers to do its job and to do it properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I regret to add that, in my home state of Tasmania, things are just as bad. Indeed, the Tasmanian government has officially been named Australia's most secretive government, with the Tasmanian Ombudsman last week confirming Tasmania is the worst jurisdiction at releasing information. Indeed, approximately one-third of requests for information under the right-to-information law are refused by Tasmanian authorities, which is a rate of refusal 750 per cent higher than Australia's most open jurisdictions, Victoria and the Northern Territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's just the start of it, because, as revealed by an Australia Institute report released today, Tasmania has weaker political donation laws, less government transparency and more limited public accountability than the other jurisdictions. Indeed, the report finds that, as other states fix their accountability mechanisms following a public corruption scandal, Tasmania routinely does nothing to fix the problem and, if it does make an attempt, it's often unsuccessful. For example, you just need to look at the 2018 state election, where the Tasmanian Liberal Party spent a record $4 million to ensure its re-election, but we simply don't know where all that money came from. Then there's the refusal of the Premier to tell us which businesses shared in the $26 million COVID hardship grant program—nor can we be assured that Tasmania's so-called integrity commission will give us any answers, because, according to the Australia Institute report, since its establishment in 2009 the Tasmanian Integrity Commission has made no misconduct findings, held no public hearings and referred no cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, all of this secrecy is simply not good enough, and the community is sick of it. Instead we need effective national and state integrity bodies with teeth, and we need to end the culture of secrecy and impunity which has become so commonplace in our parliament. A good place to start would be a well-funded, independent and genuinely effective National Audit Office that can build on the good work its already done in the public interest time and time again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to move this motion today very proud of the incredible work that Australia's top health scientists are achieving and in particular to pay tribute to those working on the vaccine in my electorate of Ryan. As the world races to find a vaccine to the crippling coronavirus, Australia is a key player in vaccine development, with direct investment in the work being progressed at the University of Queensland in St Lucia, in our electorate of Ryan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is steadfastly committed to ensuring that a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be available as soon as possible. Our national goal is to make sure that every Australian who wants to be will be vaccinated by 2021 or in 2021. An effective vaccine will not only save lives; it will reunite families and boost our economic recovery. The Morrison government has announced production and supply agreements for the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca and the University of Queensland/CSL COVID-19 vaccines. Australia will acquire 33.8 million doses of the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and 51 million doses of the UQ/CSL vaccine, with both likely to require two doses per person. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October, the Prime Minister, when visiting our electorate of Ryan, was able to hear firsthand from the team at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at the University of Queensland and to be updated on the vaccine's development. Then, just two weeks ago, the Minister for Health, also on a visit to our electorate of Ryan, attended the same labs to hear some excellent news from Professor Paul Young, who is leading the research team. Professor Young revealed that the early data from the phase 1 clinical trials indicated that the vaccine is safe and has been incredibly well tolerated amongst the trial participants. Professor Young also declared that these results showed that the vaccine induces a strong immune result and an antibody response equivalent to or better than what has been seen in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, the University of Queensland's COVID-19 vaccine trial is running ahead of schedule. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Young and his team, as I commented on the day, are incredibly humble and modest people, but the reality is that they are working incredibly long hours and insanely hard. It is not only them but their families who are making sacrifices to make sure that they can work those long hours on behalf of Australians and the worldwide community. It was such a thrill to be there in the lab with the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister to talk to those researchers one on one and to hear about their efforts to create the vaccine, to hear their passion for the project, to hear how well the collaboration is working worldwide, with colleagues right around the world, who they are working together with every single day, and to hear how well the team is working within the lab itself. I have to say that, after such an anxious year for so many of us, holding that vaccine in my hand was quite a thrill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all heroes wear capes, and in the Ryan electorate many of them wear lab coats. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank and honour the team that I met and all those behind them that are the hidden heroes behind this history-making research. I want members in this chamber and in the House to understand just how much work has been done in such a short time frame. On 10 January, the UQ team had their first official meeting and, from that day on, it was full steam ahead on vaccine creation. The very next day, 11 January, their own molecular clamp technology was put into action in the development of the candidate vaccine. By March, the team had selected their first vaccine construct and, by June, 120 volunteers had already been recruited for the trial and then, by September, an agreement for 51 million doses had been reached. The University of Queensland obviously has form when it comes to vaccine. It was in the electorate of Ryan that the very successful vaccine Gardasil was created, which helps women around the world with cervical cancer. Even with that success, this kind of speed for the team was something that they hadn't experienced before and it took an incredible amount of work. I would really like to thank all of the heroes that I met, particularly the brilliant scientists of the UQ vaccine team, Professor Paul Young, Professor Keith Chappell, Professor Trent Munro and Dr Daniel Watterson, for all their efforts in leading a team of over 105 special people, for whom Australia owes a great deal of gratitude.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak to the member for Ryan's private member's motion today, noting the worldwide development for the COVID-19 vaccine. I also want to acknowledge the government's recent announcement of the $1.7 billion agreement for two of the most promising COVID-19 vaccines: the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and our very own University of Queensland CSL vaccine. The agreement will see the vaccine manufactured entirely in Australia. I'm especially excited about the prospects of the vaccine because, being a Victorian, I can say with relief that today marks 31 days of zero cases, zero deaths and zero active cases. This is a very fine achievement by my fellow Victorians, because we have emerged from one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world. My electorate bore some of the brunt of the pandemic. It is so exciting to speak to this motion today, because my electorate of Calwell is at the centre of where Australia's COVID-19 vaccine is going to be manufactured, and that is at CSL Broadmeadows. CSL Behring has a long history in Broadmeadows. It's an iconic institution and we are proud as a community to be part of this very exciting venture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I visited CSL with the shadow minister for health, Chris Bowen. We received a briefing from CSL which confirmed that it will begin manufacturing the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine candidate at its advanced manufacturing facility in Broadmeadows. We were also taken on a tour of where the manufacturing will be happening. CSL has separate contracts with AstraZeneca and the Australian government to manufacture approximately 30 million doses of the AZD1222 vaccine candidate, which are planned for release in the first half of 2021, pending the outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The manufacturing process will start with the four vials containing vaccine cells. The cells, frozen under liquid nitrogen to preserve their integrity, need to be thawed in preparation for replication in the bioreactors at the company's Broadmeadows facilities. After growing in the bioreactors, the vaccine is filtered and purified, leaving just the antigen, or the vaccine product. It is then ready for final formulation and filling into dosage vials. The vial-thaw milestone follows several months of close collaboration and preparation by CSL and AstraZeneca technical experts, which I'm told is a first. It is first that CSL is manufacturing someone else's vaccine. During 2020-21, CSL will manufacture eight large-scale batches of vaccine drug substance. Should the vaccine demonstrate its safety and efficacy in clinical trials that are currently underway, it is anticipated that it will require a two-dose per person regime. The vaccine will not be released for use, of course, until the relevant clinical trials and manufacturing data are reviewed and approved by the Australian government's regulatory authority, the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has provided support to CSL in order to augment its capacity and capability to manufacture the AZD1222 vaccine, and this support has enabled the acquisition of specialised equipment and production inputs, the recruitment, training and redeployment of dozens of additional production personnel, and the reconfiguration of air handling and structural modification to the manufacturing facility. Through extensive company-wide coordination, CSL has scheduled production of AZD1222 in addition to manufacturing the UQ-CSL V451 COVID-19 vaccine candidate, while also maintaining its commitment to manufacture the company's vital core biotherapies. Multiple doses of the UQ-CSL V451 vaccine candidate have already been manufactured at the Broadmeadows facility and are held in readiness to progress the vaccine to phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. CSL's chief scientific officer Dr Andrew Nash said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is an important milestone and marks the end of many months of around the clock preparation by our skilled personnel globally within CSL Behring, Seqirus and research and development. Both campaigns are still technically challenging but at this time we are tracking well and expect to produce the AZD1222 and the UQ-CSL V451 vaccine for Australia by mid-2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed great news. There's great cause for hope, and I look forward to Australians receiving a COVID-19 vaccine at some stage in the course of next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:31</span>):  As the representative of Goldstein, it is a great pleasure to support this important motion, particularly as it has been moved by my good friend, an outstanding representative of his community, the member for Ryan. He's moving this motion because of the critical role of the vaccine innovation and research that's being done in his electorate through the University of Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that universities play a critical role in innovation, research and development in this country. They don't stand alone, but they are a critical part, particularly in primary science and bringing about important health treatment options and vaccinations. One of the best things about our universities is their international outlook. Because of their international outlook they are able to collaborate with research institutions all around the world to be part of international efforts, particularly in crises such as these. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that it's done not just with the hard work and effort of our medical researchers and scientists but also through the commitment and support of the federal government. In the 2020-21 budget we allocated a total of $2.3 billion to support development and production of a safe, effective vaccine in sufficient quantities to ensure that all Australians have access to such a vaccine for COVID-19. We know this is critically important not just for protecting the health and wellbeing of the Australian population––though that is absolutely critical––but it is important because it provides the foundation on which we can have the investment to rebuild and continue to strengthen our economy as we get Australians back to work, travelling internationally and connecting with their families and loved ones. The benefits are not just in dollars and cents or lives; they're also in connections. That's what we're slowly seeing as we've been able to keep COVID-19 largely out of the Australian community. It's being able to rebuild the bonds that have suffered as a consequence of this virus and the response measures that have been introduced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is playing a critical role in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine not just for our country but for the world. We have four vaccine candidates that have commenced clinical trials in Australia, which is an important step towards a safe and readily available vaccine. They include candidates developed by the University of Queensland, as I mentioned before, represented by the good member for Ryan; a Flinders University vaccine; Novavax; and Clover Biopharmaceuticals. So at every point we have both the private sector and universities working together to be part of building Australia's vaccine future. A total of $363 million in Australian government support for COVID-19 R&amp;D has been announced so far, including $96 million through the Medical Research Future Fund for research into COVID-19 related vaccines and treatments, as well as for further preparedness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, it's about not just having a vaccine, although that's important, but getting delivery of it out into the Australian community. So much of the resources that the Commonwealth has allocated are to make sure that when we have a vaccine available it gets to the affected communities, particularly taking care of older Australians; those who are vulnerable and need extra health support; our critical healthcare workers, whom we once again thank for the role they have played in containing and managing this virus; people from communities who are susceptible to the risks, who manage comorbidities or other health conditions; and the general Australian community, so they can go about their lives as well. That's why the research—for instance, at the University of Queensland, with $5 million from the Australian government for its innovative molecular clamp vaccine technology—is so important. It's why all of the different pathways, including the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, BioNTech, Janssen, Novavax and Moderna pathways, are critical. There is never any one foolproof solution, because everybody has different health conditions and some people respond to different vaccines in different ways. Making sure we have available vaccines that can be rolled out and given to people in the community so they can go about living their lives is a critical path to getting from what is now for us a kind of COVID normal back to simply normal. That's what I think Australians desperately want, and that's why the Morrison government is providing so much funding—so that we can get back to normal from a COVID normal and be in a position to have a successful Australia into the future.</span>

                  </a>  I remember the member for Goldstein's electorate. I think we all agree in this House that it's not a matter of politics but a matter of science to support vaccines. We must be guided by science in our support of vaccines. I've said before publicly and I'll say again that vaccines save lives. Vaccines have been a miracle of modern medicine, of science, of understanding, of study, of  evidence and of facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start my contribution by saying thank you. Last week I was joined by the shadow minister for health, the member for McMahon, in visiting the Burnet Institute in my electorate. The Burnet Institute is one of the top medical research facilities in Australia, and it is proudly located in my electorate, even though it does have plans to head north, to the Parkville precinct in Melbourne. The Burnet Institute is led very ably by Professor Brendan Crabb, who hosted us with the leader of the Doherty institute, Professor Sharon Lewin, who is a board member of the Burnet Institute and who also was there. It is a highly collaborative ecosystem in the medical research space. We had the privilege of walking around and speaking to the Burnet Institute. They are doing amazing work on instantaneous COVID tests, blood tests that will be able to determine whether you have COVID and how long you've had COVID for or whether you're free of COVID or have antibodies in your system. It will be a really important test that will be able to tell you instantly whether you have COVID with a very high success rate and a very low mistake rate, which is obviously an important piece of information. They also are continuing a lot of work on the other aspects of their research, including on malaria drugs and supporting work around vaccines for malaria. There is actually a vaccine coming out for malaria. It only has a 30 per cent efficiency rate, but that is better than nothing. That is being explored at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of the COVID vaccines at the moment is that there are some promising signs with vaccines. There are promising early signs with the science. Whether it's the AstraZeneca vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine or the UQ vaccine, there have been early results that suggest there is hope, that we might be able to get to a place where the world as we know it might be severely disrupted by a piece of science and a piece of medical technology that we are so desperate for in the vaccine. Even if we do get there and have a highly efficient and effective vaccine, it is still uncertain how long the vaccine will be efficient or effective for. It is still uncertain how long the vaccine will protect us from coronavirus, so it is important we are constantly based and focused on science, listening to the science, respecting it and assessing the efficiency and safety of a vaccine. However, it is amazing work and we thank all of those putting their time and effort into it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, it is important to say that in Australia we have been guided by science in order to deal with this pandemic. We've been guided by experts. Across the country our health experts have stood up next to our politicians and answered hard questions and questions on subjects that many members of the public haven't had to think about before. They needed to be supported by politicians, and I note that there are many people in this place on all sides of politics who have stood by our public health experts. But there have been members who haven't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hughes has constantly undermined our medical health experts in this place. The member for Hughes has constantly undermined our health experts in Victoria and those overseeing the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA. He's constantly spouted dangerous and false medical solutions to the coronavirus pandemic and, sadly, despite hundreds of occasions where the member for Hughes has used his prominent position, the Prime Minister has said nothing. He's said nothing to stop his MPs undermining the health response. This vaccine will be based in science when you respect the science, and we need all government MPs to do so. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I rise to support the motion put forward by the member for Ryan on the COVID-19 vaccine. Securing a COVID-19 vaccine is critical to Australia's health and economic recovery. A vaccine will give Australian people and businesses the certainty and confidence they need to reopen the economy and our borders. That's why the Morrison government has ensured that we're ready for an expected rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is contributing significantly to research and development both in Australia and around the world, investing $363 million in vaccines, therapeutics and COVID medicines, including $257 million in vaccines. As an allied health professional, I have great respect for our scientists and those who work in the health and medical industries, especially with the pressures that this pandemic has created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">CSIRO, Australia's leading science agency, is playing an important part in the development and testing of a vaccine here in Australia. Our scientists and researchers have been doing incredible work, contributing on a global level to finding treatments and a vaccine to COVID-19. I'd like to acknowledge and thank them for their exceptional work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Morrison government's COVID-19 vaccine and treatment strategy, Australia has secured 134.8 million doses through advanced purchasing agreements. By securing multiple COVID-19 vaccines, we are giving Australians the best possible shot at early access to a vaccine, should trials prove successful. We have invested over $1.7 billion into our two lead vaccine candidates—the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the University of Queensland's molecular clamp, which is being developed here in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These vaccines will largely be supplied through CSL, an Australian based company in Melbourne, who will facilitate the production of the vaccines here in Australia. This means we will be boosting manufacturing in Australia. In fact CSL has begun manufacturing the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus candidate vaccine in Victoria, and this will mean that production is starting on approximately 30 million doses of the vaccine. It should be very reassuring to many of us that these vaccines are being produced by a trusted Australian supplier, one that has likely supplied many of our flu vaccines. This agreement shows where our government's priority lies: protecting the health of Australians and backing our economy by locally producing our vaccine supply. To strengthen our position further, the Morrison government has secured two more COVID-19 vaccine agreements. This takes the Australian government's total COVID-19 vaccine investment to more than $3.2 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our strategy puts Australia at the front of the queue if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light—and trials are proving to be very promising. It means that we're on track for first vaccines to be delivered in the first quarter of 2021, and they will be available for free to those who choose to be vaccinated. Health and aged-care workers as well as the elderly and vulnerable members of our community will be the first to gain access to the vaccine. When Australia has fulfilled our domestic vaccination plan, we will provide additional vaccines to regional partners in the Pacific and South-East Asia. This will allow for a shared recovery across our neighbours, which will not only play an important role in leading humanitarian aid but also mean that tourism and trade across our region can pick up sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a world-class vaccination program with world-leading vaccination rates. The Morrison government has built on this capacity to secure a COVID-19 vaccine and treatment strategy. It places us in the best possible position to attain a safe and effective vaccine, a vaccine that will be manufactured locally in Australia and rolled out free of charge to all Australians who choose to be immunised. It's an essential part of our plan to protect the health of all Australians and recover from the COVID-19 recession.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  This morning I speak not only as the proud member of the electorate of Oxley but also as a proud Queenslander. It's been phenomenal to see how, over the last six months, the world has truly rallied together to fight what has been a pandemic like no other. As a proud University of Queensland graduate, I thank the member for Ryan for the work that he has done in highlighting the work of the University of Queensland, in particular. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a neighbour of the member for Ryan's electorate, I wanted to go on the record today to thank our doctors, research scientists and specialists, who have been working tirelessly and around the clock to create a COVID-19 vaccine. I acknowledge the federal government and the Queensland government for their investment into research and creation of the vaccine. This is a vaccine that opens our doors back up to the world. It opens up Australia for business. It's the vaccine that we need. It has the potential to bring families back together, open up international travel and further Australia's investment and mark on the international stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Queensland is the only Australian organisation tasked by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. The funding announced is important for CEPI's ongoing financial support. The world, I believe, one day may thank the UQ vaccination team, including Professor Paul Young, Associate Professor Keith Chappell, Professor Trent Munro and Dr Daniel Watterson for developing the vaccine that stops the killer COVID-19 in its tracks. All eyes are on these brilliant scientists, who are standing front and centre in the war. But thank you also goes to the 105 leaders who have emerged out of the darkness of 2020 offering a bright, unified spirit of togetherness. When interviewed, the scientists shared that they felt the arms of Queenslanders and other heroes across Australia holding them high and spurring them on. Professor Young said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The generosity and commitment I've witnessed has been nothing short of amazing. And this enormous group of contributors is still not everyone who's been involved. I'd like to thank absolutely everybody who was part of this broader team in the ongoing journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together they have been working day and night on all fronts, and they have had teams of people and members completing lab work, managing trials, addressing legal and regulatory requirements and, of course, raising the funds to supercharge vaccine production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we need to make sure that, when a vaccine does become available, it becomes available to as many Australians as quickly as possible. That's the objective here. Vaccines don't solve this issue and stop the virus; the actual vaccinations do. That's why we need to make sure that we maximise the number of people who have access to those vaccinations. Alarm bells have gone off for me when I've seen the anti-vaxxers out and about already trying to position themselves—those kooks and people who misspeak—and constantly warning people against vital vaccinations. My message to my community and to the rest of Australia is: trust the science, trust the evidence and trust the leaders in what they are doing to help protect our country. Strategic tactical planning as part of a comprehensive industry policy will help Australia anticipate and be better prepared for such a global challenges and changes ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge not just the lead scientists but all of the wonderful support staff and scientific community that have been rallying and supporting the work of the scientists. It's important to be realistic. The Australian people know that they need transparency when it comes to a vaccine strategy that puts safety and health first. While hope needs to be lifted in difficult times, it is important we make statements and projections as realistic as possible so families and communities are not set up for disappointment. The aim here, wherever they are around the world, is to protect as many Australians as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Queensland government, particularly Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for her tough stance on borders and on protecting Queenslanders. We know in our state that the Queensland government led the way when it came to health and safety. The Queensland election was a flash-point in how Queenslanders saw the performance of our state government, and they resoundly returned the Queensland Premier because of her deep commitment to the protection, health and wellbeing of my fellow Queenslanders. I want to thank all members of the government and, in particular, my friend the Premier of Queensland who has worked tirelessly this year to protect and keep safe Queenslanders and to do the best for our country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282986" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALLEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  COVID-19 has dominated our lives and wreaked havoc on the health and prosperity of almost every nation on this planet. That said, Australia has done better than most countries in aggressively suppressing COVID-19 and in learning to live with the virus. This is a testament to the Australian people and to the personal restrictions that we have undertaken in order to help keep each other safe. It's also a testament to the trust that we as a country have placed in our Australian governments to deliver safe, secure quarantine arrangements and effective contact tracing. There have been stumbles along the way, but it's fair to say we have now achieved in aggressive suppression what is to be the envy of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What next for Australia? With an influx of overseas arrivals returning home for Christmas, it is critical that we continue to defend our borders and stringently enforce 14-day mandatory quarantine. We cannot let our guard down on this front. This remains our strongest defence; it is what has kept us safe as a nation. Looking forward over the next months and years, in order for this island nation to effectively connect again with the world in trade, tourism, international students or Australians returning home, we will need an alternative to 14-day quarantining and that alternative is a vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the extraordinary work of researchers here and around the world, a vaccine is ever closer to reality. There are more than 350 vaccines now in trial around the world. Over the weekend, it was announced that National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom have been told to prepare for the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as soon as 7 December; that is one week away. We're on the cusp of a completely new world of COVID management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far Australia has entered into advanced purchasing arrangements with vaccine manufacturers AstraZeneca, CLS, Pfizer and Novovax. We have contracted for 134 million vaccines directly. I'm proud to say the Morrison government will ensure the vaccine is provided free to all Australians. Australia also has access to a number of other potential vaccines through the international COVAX facility. We have lots of lines of inquiry open because we understand that in research you can never be sure about what's going to develop. Data on vaccine safety and efficacy is very promising, leading to the confidence of a successful vaccine being delivered here in Australia some time in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great news is that there are many vaccines showing promising results, not just those we invested in but right around the world. It is also worth noting that three vaccine candidates have begun clinical trials in Australia, including one by the University of Queensland using molecular clamp technology, one by Flinders University—an Adelaide company vaccine—and one by international company Clover Biopharmaceuticals. Australia has always punched above its weight in the field of medical research and this time is no different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also incredibly imperative that we make sure every vaccine is safe and effective. One aspect of safety and effectiveness—so that we can ensure there is no vaccine hesitancy about this new development—is that different vaccines may be required for different ages, because our immune systems appear to be responding differently to COVID. So Australia has enabled the most experienced scientists and biotech and pharmaceutical experts to provide advice, through the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia-Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group. This group is essential, because we want to ensure we continue to have the trust of the Australian public in this incredibly important development. The advisory group is led by Professor Brendan Murphy, our former Chief Medical Officer, who many will have seen on a daily basis in press conferences and who does have the trust of the Australian community. He will lead this group of experts to assess and work through all viable options to test, secure and administer a safe and effective vaccine if and when one is finally ready to be delivered. The vaccine will go through Australia's safety tests. While we all encourage people to take it, it will remain voluntary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is looking hopefully to a future where we will have curtailed and controlled COVID. This is a crisis the likes of which we have never seen. But what distinguishes this crisis from those of the past is our ability to respond, in an unprecedented way, with globally collaborative research to develop diagnostics and treatments and vaccines to beat this pandemic. This is an incredibly exciting time for the world's scientists.</span>

                  </a>  Tomorrow is of course the first day of summer, the day when Australians think about flocking to our beaches and waterways over the wonderful warm months of our year. It's also the first National Water Safety Day, a day when we highlight awareness of the risks associated with swimming and of the risks of drowning over the course of the summer months in particular. It's vitally important that, on this day, we highlight the importance of staying safe and acting responsibly around water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is of course a nation surrounded by water, and we're blessed with some of the most beautiful and pristine coastlines and waterways of any nation in the world. As the weather warms up, more of us will head to the beaches, the rivers and the pools to cool off and have fun. We love being in and around the water. But unfortunately too many Australians lose their lives in the water each year, particularly in the summer months. Summer is the peak season for drownings in Australia. From 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, 248 people drowned in Australia. Thirty-nine per cent of those drownings occurred over the three months of summer. We are losing too many young Australians to the water. Royal Life Saving, in its annual drowning report, found that those aged between 25 and 34 years accounted for 17 per cent of the total number of drowning deaths. It's the most of any age group and represents so many lost summers into the future. For the family and friends of those lost to the water, summer will forever be tinged with sadness. The Royal Life Saving report shows that an additional 504 people experienced a non-fatal drowning incident. These are too many close calls that could easily have led to more tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All drowning deaths are preventable, and one drowning is still too many, but, as a nation, we have made some slight progress to turn the tide on drownings. The drowning report indicates that the total number of drowning deaths over the past year decreased by eight per cent on the previous year. Despite rivers and creeks still being the leading location for drowning deaths, drownings in rivers and creeks decreased by 32 per cent compared to the 10-year average. As we get ready to dive into summer, we know that drownings and accidents in the water can be avoided if we act responsibly and follow the basic water safety rules. I urge all Australians to always swim between the red-and-yellow flags at the beach and obey the instructions of lifesavers. Please don't swim on unpatrolled beaches or swim alone, and never ever take your eye off children when you are around the water—and, of course, alcohol and swimming and/or boating don't mix. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ahead of National Water Safety Day and the first day of summer, it's also vital that we note that there are too many avoidable drownings that occur when people go rock fishing. Rock fishers should always stay alert to the weather conditions, learn how to swim, choose the safest possible location for fishing, wear the right gear, never ever fish alone and always wear a life jacket. I also encourage all Australians to learn how to swim from a qualified instructor before they enter the water on their own. For all of us who use the waterways regularly, please take the opportunity to learn rescue techniques and resuscitation from organisations like Surf Life Saving Australia by joining your local surf club. I know that there are many members of local surf clubs who are in the parliament who encourage people in their communities to become involved in those clubs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our leading water safety authorities, including Surf Life Saving Australia and Royal Life Saving, play an important role in helping keep Australians safe in and around the water. Their dedicated efforts, including through professional lifeguards, lifesavers and thousands of volunteers contributing millions of hours of patrols each year, make a vital and greatly valued contribution to our nation. Interventions performed by surf lifesavers and lifeguards result in more than 1,300 avoided fatalities and 800 avoided critical injuries each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ahead of National Water Safety Day, I join with my co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving, the member for Mackellar, and other surf lifesavers in this place to call on Australians to play it safe when enjoying your time around the water this summer. If we stay safe together, we can enjoy many more summers into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I want to acknowledge the member for Kingsford Smith for bringing on this motion. It's well timed and well executed, so thank you. I have been a surf lifesaver for 14 years—I had to check that this morning because I couldn't quite remember how long it had been—and in that time I have seen the very best of people and their selfless dedication to their fellow Australians. I've seen and experienced great acts of bravery, where volunteers have run and swum towards danger to ensure that a member of the public gets to go home after an innocent day at the beach. This speech is for the brave members of the surf lifesaving fraternity who at times are called upon to risk their own lives to save the life of another, who is usually a complete stranger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motto of Surf Life Saving Australia is 'vigilance and service'. Between the red-and-yellow flags dotted around the coast of this great land are surf clubs and lifesaving clubs, whose volunteers give up time from work and their own families to keep our beaches safe. In the 113 years of the existence of surf clubs in our country, there has only ever been one reported case of a death of someone swimming between the red-and-yellow flags. When you compare that to the almost 150,000 people who have been saved swimming between the red-and-yellow flags, that is an amazing accomplishment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so incredibly proud to be a member of the Alex Surf Club, where I've been active for 14 years. The club is an amazing, family-friendly club and has been since its inception in 1924. Joining the Alex Surf Club certainly changed my life, not just because of the people I've worked alongside of but because of the emphasis it's taught me to place upon my own health and fitness. It's taught me so many life and leadership skills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I have seen the very best of people in my role, I have also seen the very worst. On a recent patrol just a few weeks ago, one of my team, Steve Ling, pulled two little kids out of the surf. They'd been caught in a strong sweep and were being pulled out to sea. But for the quick thinking and actions of Steve, the outcome could have been disastrous. Assisted by another team member, the two young kids were brought to shore—and they were no older than 10. When I asked, 'Where are your mum and dad?' 'They're up at the Bluff Bar.' Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. Parents: lifesavers and lifeguards are not babysitters. Your children are your responsibility. It's your responsibility to be down at the beach and, depending on their age, be with them in the water or at the very least by the water's edge. Watch them like a hawk. Unsupervised children can drown in the bath, let alone the ocean. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see so many people who choose not to swim in the flagged area. Some of them are drunk or under the influence of drugs; some can't even swim at all. Why do they do it? I simply don't understand. Please: swim between the flags; bathe in accordance with your own abilities and the conditions; don't swim whilst under the influence; and always feel free to speak to lifesavers to ask them for up-to-date weather and surf conditions. Remember: if we can't see you, we can't save you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to thank the following members that have volunteered as part of patrol team 3 which I have been the captain of over the last eight years—in alphabetical order: Ami Bateman, Dekota Berkery, David Birch, Olivia Bredhauer, Caroline Campbell, Paul Campbell, David Clancy, Karl Dittko, Peter Duffy, Mitch Duffy, Benjamin Ehlers, Brett Fellowes, Karl Fidler, Jaykob Flaherty, Brad Graver, Isaac Hamstead, James Hill, Julie Horgan, Scott Howarth, Dale Kleinschmidt, Jonathan Last, Gavin Lewis, Steve Ling, Harry Ling, Jessica Ling, Cheryl Ling, Rob Matchett, Chris Morrison, Angus Roberts, Lyn Roberts, Gary Roberts, Richard Short, Ben Synak, Kristy Taylor, Louise Taylor-Smith, Dylan Wheeler and Kail Willis. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank Glen Garrick OAM. Glen, but for your encouragement and mentorship, I would never have become a lifesaver, nor would I have become involved in the leadership of the club nor PC for patrol team 3. Thanks for your friendship and for continuing to fill in for me when this job doesn't allow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  The New South Wales South Coast is best known for its beautiful beaches. We are a water community and we have some of the most famous beaches in Australia and indeed across the world. Hand in hand with that, of course, means we have some of the best surf lifesavers. For National Water Safety Day, I want to talk about the amazing work our surf lifesavers do in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited beautiful Kiama to chat with Brad from <span style="font-style:italic;">Surf Rescue 50</span>. This jet boat is a vital asset that is almost unique to the South Coast. Manned largely by volunteers, last summer this team responded to over 20 emergency call-outs and accumulated over 700 patrolling hours. It is an incredible achievement and a stark reminder why boat and surf safety is absolutely critical. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the rescues this team does would not be possible without their ability to mobilise quickly and efficiently around the clock. We are so lucky to have them on our South Coast. Thankfully, the work of our local surf lifesavers does not go unrecognised. When you have the best beaches and the best surf lifesavers, you also have outstanding rescues. Last year I was proud to present three of Kiama's surf lifesavers, Rhys Dawson, Brad Dawson and Toby Streamer, with the National Rescue Medal in Parliament House for a harrowing rescue of a rock fisher who was swept out to sea in dangerous surf on 4 August 2019—remarkable. Well done and thank you to Rhys, Brad and Toby. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just Kiama that is lucky enough to have award-winning surf lifesavers. In November, Batemans Bay Surf Life Saving Club captain, Anthony Bellette, was named the winner in the surf lifesaving category of the 2020 Rotary Emergency Services Community Awards. Congratulations to Anthony. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far South Coast surf clubs deserve special recognition here, and there is no doubt that Anthony played a pivotal role in the response to the summer's bushfires. The volunteers did a simply remarkable job of helping and supporting the local community during the bushfires. Across the Batemans Bay, Broulee and Bermagui surf clubs, teams of volunteers—led by Anthony, Andy Edmunds and Cheryl McCarthy—sheltered over 7,000 people on New Year's Eve. Devastatingly, thousands of local people ended up on those beaches during the fires, trying to find a means of escape. In the middle of the night, teams of surf lifesavers snapped into action, arranging food and water. They provided medical support to those who needed it, and when buildings around the Batemans Bay club caught fire they evacuated people from the clubhouse to the beach. All of the clubs used their ATVs to collect people from the nearby streets and bring them to safety. They literally saved lives in what were terrifying conditions. Broulee came under direct and significant ember attack with 1,000 people in the clubhouse, many of whom the volunteers had helped to evacuate there. They all ended up on the beach. It was incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clubs stayed open the next day and for weeks after as community recovery centres. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, as soon as the highway was open, I visited the Batemans Bay surf club to see firsthand how they had kept this incredible effort going. The club was now a donation hub. Food was being cooked for those without power or homes. They just kept going. So it is no surprise that club captain Anthony won this award. It is also no surprise that the club won the far South Coast branch's rescue of the year for the bushfires or that the Batemans Bay bushfire response team won the services team award at the Surf Life Saving New South Wales Awards of Excellence. All of these clubs deserve this and so much more. Thank you to all the clubs' members and all the amazing volunteers for their efforts not only during the bushfires but every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up on the South Coast, and I understand how important our surf lifesaving clubs are. That's why in the 2019 election I committed with Labor to a new training centre for the South Coast branch of Surf Life Saving New South Wales, as part of the integrated emergency management centre in Nowra. I was thrilled when the government matched my commitment, and I was pleased to see the contract for construction signed last week. Like so many local people, I am incredibly proud of our surf lifesavers. There are too many amazing clubs to name here, but you all deserve recognition. Thank you for everything you do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  It is my great pleasure to co-sponsor this motion with my good friend the member for Kingsford Smith, whose love of all things surf lifesaving is well known, and if it isn't it should be. His time as a nipper was, I'm assured, great and glorious, and he saved many people. To hear him, you would think he saved me at one point. For that he needs to answer to the Australian people, and he will in due course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was born in Manly, and it was kind of a prerequisite that you had to love the ocean to be born in Manly. As a kid, summer days were spent swimming in the ocean and rock pools of north Narrabeen. There were feeble attempts at surfing, which continue to this day, and an admiration for those men and women in the red-and-yellow caps who quietly lined the shore, their protective gaze scanning the water as swimmers bobbed in and out of the waves. As an adult I still enjoy those very same beaches and respect those very same guardians in the red and yellow. As a proud nippers dad, I take great pride in seeing my own daughter getting involved with our local club, giving me an added appreciation of the work surf lifesavers do for our community. I want to go off script and thank Zeke, because occasionally 30 girls will swim so far out into the ocean that you can no longer see them, yet somehow Zeke makes sure that 30 girls come back. I'm sure one day a couple of them will end up in New Zealand, but until then we're okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because McKellar and the northern beaches is one of the best places in the world we have the most surf lifesaving clubs in the world. As a beaches community, water safety is always on our mind. Mums and dads swim in the ocean for exercise and leisure. Boys and girls participate in nippers and their surf rescue certificate for the same reasons. It all stems from the amazing volunteer organisation that is Surf Life Saving Australia. It is an organisation which represents the best in Australia, volunteerism: everyday Australians from all walks of life giving up their time to help others. Often receiving little to no thanks or favour, they do it because they care. The federal government commits millions of dollars each year towards water safety, to organisations including Royal Life Saving Australia, Surf Life Saving Australia, AUSTSWIM and Laurie Lawrence's swimming enterprises. Surf Life Saving Australia is the largest recipient of funding under this program, with $20.8 million over three years. This considerable investment has supported programs and projects to reduce the incidence of coastal water related injury and death, increase community awareness of coastal water safety and enhance coastal water monitoring and rescue services. I have proudly supported local clubs in my electorate by fighting for further financial support and upgrades to their facilities. This includes $1.9 million to upgrade the dilapidated building for the Longreach Surf Life Saving Club. Peter Kinsey, Rob Pearson, Margaret Pearson and the entire club membership deserve a state-of-the-art clubhouse to support their operations, and that is exactly what they are getting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are many other groups which contribute to keeping us all safe in the water, including swim schools and the first aid organisations educating Australians on how to perform CPR. The federal government is committed to supporting the work of the Australian Water Safety Council, which includes the Surf Life Saving Australia and Royal Life Saving Society Australia. The council's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian water safety strategy 2016-20</span> is coming to a close, and I understand the next strategy is set for release early next year. Royal Life Saving Society Australia is being provided with $10.3 million to enhance monitoring and rescue services in the water, including inland waterways and swimming pools; undertake research and collect data on fatal and non-fatal drownings; develop education and communication tools for various audiences; educate the community and promote safety awareness; and develop and use systems to benchmark national standards. Much can be said about the brave men and women of Surf Life Saving Australia, but, put simply, it displays the best of our community, for it is these volunteers which make our society so great.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow is the first day of summer. It will also mark the first National Water Safety Day. I congratulate the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends Of Surf Life Saving, Jason Falinski and Matt Thistlethwaite, on this important initiative. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians love the outdoors and the water: swimming, fishing, boating, surfing, snorkelling or sailing. It's part of our way of life, especially for coastal communities like mine on the Central Coast of New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Water Safety Day is an important opportunity to focus on staying safe and acting responsibly around the water as we head into the summer months and the school holidays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year, too many Australians lose their lives to drowning. From 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, 248 Australians lost their lives in the water. Royal Life Saving estimates another 504 people experienced a non-fatal drowning incident. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting better. The statistics show a reduction in the number of incidents. The annual <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Life Saving </span><span style="font-style:italic;">national </span><span style="font-style:italic;">drowning report</span> shows the number of drowning deaths over the past year decreased by eight per cent on the year before and that deaths in rivers and creeks, the leading location for drownings, decreased by 32 per cent, compared with the 10-year average. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must always be vigilant. Even experienced swimmers can be at risk in the water. Only last month, there was a serious incident at Wyong Olympic Pool in my electorate, where three Central Coast council lifeguards on duty at the time, Douglas Kingston, Adam Chay and David Lamond, helped save the life of a young water polo player in distress. I would like to thank Adam, Doug and David for their quick action to help save the life of this young man and recognise the important work professional lifeguards do every day keeping us safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the professional lifeguards, there are volunteers—surf lifesavers giving their time to keep us safe on the beaches every summer. Yesterday, I joined Toowoon Bay Surf Life Saving Club president, Phil Raymont, to present the national medal to four outstanding volunteer surf lifesavers from Toowoon Bay, joining the ranks of 13 others at their club, recognised with this prestigious award. The national medal, established in 1975, is one of the original elements of the Australian distinctive system of honours and rewards. You require 15 years of service to qualify for this medal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Tracie Cole, who joined Toowoon Bay in 2001 as a nipper parent, attaining her bronze in 2004. Since then Tracie has patrolled consistently and is now a patrol captain. Craig Cole joined Toowoon Bay in 2004 as a nipper parent, attaining his bronze in 2005, and has consistently patrolled Toowoon Bay since. Patrol captain John Vergara joined Toowoon Bay in 2001, attaining his bronze medallion in 2004. He has consistently patrolled Toowoon Bay since attaining his bronze and is now part of the emergency call out team. He is also a trainer, assessor and facilitator. Finally, congratulations to Wendy McNamara. Wendy joined Toowoon Bay in 2006, having previously been a member at Lakes Beach. Wendy attained her bronze medallion in 2000 and has consistently patrolled Toowoon Bay since gaining her bronze. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a big contribution, as the member for Kingsford Smith would understand––patrolling for over 30 hours a year every season for 15 years. It is a big responsibility. Surf Life Saving Central Coast's annual report showed that on the Central Coast 806 people were treated with first aid and another 564 people were rescued last season by our volunteer surf lifesavers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more volunteers to help out. If you are ready for the next step to jump in and become a surf lifesaver, signing up for your bronze medallion is a start, like I did in September, signing up to do my bronze medallion with Toowoon Bay Surf Lifesaving Club. Starting this October, each week I have learnt new skills and gained a better understanding of the surf, the conditions of safety and risk and how to help out. On Sunday I will be taking my final assessment. I would like to give a shout-out to my instructors, chief training officer, Sue Hale and life members Mick Cook and Graham Sherer, who have shown this rookie the ropes, and to patrol captain and life member Bil Kensey, who will assess our group of bronzies this Sunday. I would encourage anyone who is interested in signing up for their bronze to have a go. You will learn valuable life skills like rescue techniques and resuscitation. The course is offered through surf lifesaving clubs locally across Australia—at Toowoon Bay, Lakes, Soldiers Beach, North Entrance, The Entrance, Shelly Beach or Wamberal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ahead of National Water Safety Day tomorrow I would like to thank all our professional lifeguards working on the Central Coast and in the pools this summer and the volunteer lifesavers, who keep everyone on the coast safe—visitors and locals across the summer on the sand and in the water. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (12:22):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the motion by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith. I acknowledge the work he does in this place and outside as well, particularly with the surf lifesaving club. I also acknowledge the member for Mackellar and the work that he does with his surf club on the Northern Beaches. I am sure there is some competition between north and south.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am one of the lucky ones. Growing up on the mid-north coast I had the benefit of the beautiful beaches of Crescent Head, South West Rocks and Hat Head, as well as swimming in the mighty Macleay. I am also lucky that I don't recall learning how to swim. It just seemed that I always knew. Maybe that was the benefit of being the youngest of five children. But I know that it was a consequence of my mother and father knowing how important it was to get their children into the pool and learning how to swim as early as possible, whether that was because of what they saw––my father was a country GP and my mother a nurse. I certainly saw in my time as a police officer the tragic consequences of failing to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard today that last year alone 248 people drowned in Australian waterways. Eighty per cent of those were males. One always thinks about the beach being the most dangerous, but the top three locations were in fact a river or creek at 21 per cent and then 20 per cent in the harbour and 18 per cent at the beach. One-quarter were recreational swimmers. Twenty per cent were from boating. Despite this being an eight per cent decrease from 2018-19 and a 12 per cent decrease over the last decade of the national average, it is still far too high. I have to say that many of those deaths were avoidable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would like to concentrate on what I hope we can reduce to zero, and that is young children, zero to four years of age, dying in backyard pools. From July 2002 to June 2017, 87 per cent of drownings for children zero to four happened in backyard pools. A study over that period found that the most common causes of distractions were indoor household duties, like doing the washing up; outdoor duties; electronic distractions, such as looking at your phone, being on your computer, looking at your iPad and not looking at the kids; and child care—looking after another sibling and thinking that the little one is going to be okay just sitting on the step or looking after somebody else's kids. I say to parents, mums, dads, child-care givers and grandparents: you've got to watch your kids. I am guilty of it; I have answered the phone when my kids have been in the pool. We cannot do it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, we need to make sure that we check the locks on our gates regularly. You might think, 'My child is not in the pool and it is okay to go off and doing something,' but make sure that your gate is locked properly and make sure that there are no other avenues for the kids to, for example, put a block there and get over the fence. It is so important to do that. This is where our most vulnerable people, our children, our little ones, are dying. So please make an effort over this summer to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all the surf lifesavers. They are volunteer workers and they do a fantastic job. I'm proud to be the patron for both the South West Rocks Surf Lifesaving Club and the Kempsey Swimming Club, and I thank them for having me as one of their patrons. I'd also like to thank surfers. I know there's a bit of competition between clubbies and surfers but, invariably, when the flags come down, the surfers are still there and they do such a fantastic job. They make many, many life-saving saves, and I would like to give a shout out to them and thank them for their efforts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC Week was held from 8 to 15 November, having been moved this year because of COVID-19 from its usual July timeslot. NAIDOC Week celebrates the history, culture and traditions of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It traces its history to the Aboriginal activist movements of the 1920s and 1930s led by the remarkable Yorta Yorta leader, William Cooper. When I think of that generation and the generation of Yorta Yorta leaders that followed, I think of what a magnificent group of people they were. Whether it was Cooper himself, Sir Douglas Nicholls or, in more recent times, Burnum Burnum, they did so much to bring to the public's attention the issues facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">William Cooper, in particular, is noted for his petitioning of government through various petitions and his most famous petition of King George where he asked for recognition of Aboriginal people. We can trace some of the current debates we're having about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recognition to the work of William Cooper. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cooper was among other things a man of Christian faith, and it was churches that first took part in National Aborigines Day, which today we observe as NAIDOC Week. Dr Meredith Lake in her <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bible in Australia: A Cultural History </span>quotes Cooper's letter to Prime Minister Lyons. Drawing on his Christian heritage, he asked:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Are you prepared to admit that, since the Creator said in his Word that all men are of 'one blood' we are humans with feelings like yourselves in the eyes of Almighty God, that we can have joys and our sorrows, our likes and our dislikes, that we can feel pain, degradation, and humiliation just as you do?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Cooper was a Christian, one of the reasons that I particularly acknowledge his memory and honour is because of the extraordinary thing he did in 1938 at the time of the Kristallnacht incidents in Germany where Nazis came around and smashed up the shops, synagogues and homes of Jewish people. William Cooper led one of the very few protests against Kristallnacht anywhere. At a time when his own people were facing their absolute nadir, there was a view in the 1930s that the Aboriginal population in Australia was in terminal decline. Despite all of the problems his own people faced, the fact that he took this remarkable action in standing up for others who were persecuted around the world makes him a truly remarkable human being. I was pleased to represent the Minister for Indigenous Australians last year at a Jewish community event in December to commemorate 81 years since the protests that Cooper led in relation to Kristallnacht.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC Week is a time that we should reflect on remarkable Indigenous Australians. Having mentioned Cooper, I want to mention another remarkable Indigenous Australian, who was born 100 years ago this year, somebody who, during NAIDOC Week, I had cause to think about, because we stood for the Remembrance Day ceremonies in the Reg Saunders courtyard over at the Australian War Memorial. Reg Saunders was born in 1920 in Framlingham reserve in Victoria. His father had served in the First AIF, and Reg went on to be the first commissioned officer of Aboriginal background in the ADF. That's a point of history and knowledge that many Australians will know. What most people probably won't know is what a remarkable war service he actually had. He enlisted almost at the start of the war and served initially in the Middle East, in Libya, and then took part in the Battle of Greece and the Battle of Crete. I want to read something from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of Biography</span> about his exploits in Crete:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On 26 May—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">1941—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">he took part in the bayonet charge at '42nd Street' that temporarily disorganised the enemy. When Allied resistance on the island ceased at the end of the month, the 2/7th Battalion was left behind in the hasty evacuation. Saunders was one of a number of soldiers who refused to surrender. Assisted by sympathetic Cretans, he avoided capture for eleven months. On 7 May 1942 he escaped aboard a trawler to … Libya. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was an extraordinary act of derring-do that he engaged in. That wasn't the end of his war service. He went on to serve in New Guinea, where he was promoted to captain, and later in Korea, where he served in 3RAR in a major battle against the Chinese and North Korean forces, and his battalion was awarded the US Distinguished Unit Citation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had a wonderful sense of humour and was a man much loved by the soldiers he commanded. My favourite story about Reg Saunders was when one officer said, 'Korea is not much of a place for a white man,' and Saunders quipped, 'Well, it's not much of a place for a black man either.' NAIDOC Week is a wonderful occasion for us to remember distinguished Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the contribution they make to our country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I second the motion. I support this motion and I'd like to acknowledge all the traditional owners of this country, past and present, including the Ngunawal, on whose land we stand today. Many people may wish to dismiss the acknowledgement of country as just a symbolic statement, but it's much more than that. It's something that should be respected, and I and many people respect the symbolism, because symbols create tradition. They create culture. Importantly, they can, bit by bit, chip away at biases, prejudice, preconceived notions and stereotypes and create change. This is why NAIDOC Week is so important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every week NAIDOC Week gives us the chance to celebrate the history, culture and achievements of our First Nations people. It's an important celebration because, all too often, our discourse around First Nations people centres on inequalities and injustices past and present. It is vital that we keep on doing everything in our power to correct these inequalities and right those injustices wherever we can, because the disparity in the life choices and chances for First Nations people in this country remains absolutely shocking, whether it's in relation to children in detention, domestic violence, health outcomes, educational outcomes or incarceration—and the list goes on and on. First Nations people remain so disproportionately represented in these areas that there is no other word for it than 'shocking'. This is something that we must all, as a nation, take responsibility for, and we all must play a part in addressing it. But, at the same time, it should not stop us from celebrating our First Nations people, especially their unbreakable connection to the land, to this country, and their contribution to our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme for this year's NAIDOC Week is 'Always Was, Always Will Be'. That is a powerful statement: it always was and always will be. It reminds us that First Nations people have occupied and lived on this land, on this continent, that we call home today for over 65,000 years. During those 65,000 years, they have had a long and rich spiritual and cultural connection to this country. This year's NAIDOC Week reminds us that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were Australia's first explorers, first navigators, first engineers, first farmers, first botanists, first scientists, first diplomats, first astronomers and first artists, and that is something that we should celebrate—one of the longest periods, over 65,000 years, of any history in the world. We should be proud of this, and we should be proud to have one of the world's oldest oral stories, paintings, ceremonies and unique technologies right here in this country we call home. Their connection to and knowledge of the land has taught them to adapt to climate change, droughts, rising sea levels, and the list goes on. While we learn at university and schools about Shakespeare, Egyptian pyramids, European explorers and classical Greek, we should also be learning about the great pioneers who inhabited this land long, long before us. NAIDOC Week reminds us that there is a gap in our knowledge and understanding and that we would all be richer were we to know more about it. As I said: it always was and always will be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine: there were once hundreds of nations throughout our continent, speaking hundreds of different languages, with different stories and different histories. It's estimated that in the late 18th century around 250 distinct Indigenous language groups covered this continent. Today around 120 of those languages are still spoken, and many unfortunately are at risk of being lost as elders pass on. Language is the link that connects us from generation to generation. When you break that link that connectivity somehow breaks as well. It's so important to try as much as we can to keep as many of these languages going and to do everything we can as governments to assist those languages to continue. They're not just a means of communication; they express knowledge about everything: law, geography, history, family, human relationships, philosophy, religion, anatomy, child care, health care, caring for country, astronomy, biology and food. Their continued loss is also our loss.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I firstly acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and pay my respect to their elders past and present as the foundation of this discussion about the celebration of NAIDOC Week. I want to thank in particular my esteemed colleague the member for Berowra for bringing this motion on and to acknowledge the critical role that NAIDOC Week plays in the celebration of our national life and culture. While it was only a couple of weeks ago, the spirit that sits behind NAIDOC Week is not something we need contain to the week; it's something that we can celebrate year round as part of the ongoing continuum of our country. That is what we are ultimately celebrating in NAIDOC Week—not a moment, not a day, but the continuation of a culture that has survived for more than 65,000 years on, let's face it, one of the most arduous and challenging continents on earth and against the backdrop of European settlement and its consequences for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the theme of 'Always Was, Always Will Be' is such a critical theme. It's about that continuum. While there may have been moments of disruption, we celebrate the contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, as the previous member remarked, as the first explores, the first navigators, the first engineers, the first farmers, the first botanists, the first scientists, the first diplomats, the first astronomers, the first artists, the first owners, the first cultivators, the first contributors and the first celebrators of the earth that sits beneath our feet. That is something that we should celebrate critically for one week, but it is also something that we should celebrate year round—because it's part of our journey as a country. And while we go through discussions about what should be in the Constitution or about other legislative proposals for recognising the critical role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and for not just making sure they have their voice to our nation's parliament but also addressing the historical injustices that have confronted them. We must always recognise that continuum and that the objective is not to have separate mobs but to have one mob where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders recognise the contribution that all Australians make and that we recognise the contribution that they make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly touched many years ago when I went to a RECOGNISE dinner where this point was made critically by the incredible Indigenous leader, and daughter of another incredible Indigenous leader, Rachel Perkins. She's always been both pragmatic and romantic, and I say that as a compliment, about the role that we all have in the continuum of this country and its future. We should do so, because there is so much that we—all Australians—can learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through their arts, their culture, their cultivation and their respect for this land. One of the issues we all must confront is the consequences of denying culture, particularly the erosion of languages. Languages are not just the pathway to communication. Sitting behind them are so many of the values and the stories that pre-existed codification through modern European settlement. Some of them survive in art works, but we must keep them alive today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC Week is also an opportunity to celebrate the incredible contributions of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who have made their contribution to the success of our country. I know the member for Berowra referred specifically to William Cooper, who is one of the most significant people in our country, regardless of their indigeneity. It adds greater weight because of the specific challenges that Indigenous Australians were focusing on at the time for him to have been bold and courageous enough to stand up for people across the world and to say, 'No more—this is not the type of conduct that we will accept.' Of course, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have made their way into this parliament and have made an incredible contribution to this parliament as well. I always remember the first Indigenous senator, Neville Bonner, from the great state of Queensland, who has been followed by other Indigenous leaders who represent all communities in this parliament.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise to speak on the member for Berowra's motion on NAIDOC Week, and I commend him for this motion. I note also his ongoing commitment to this issue and to Indigenous Australians. His sincerity and commitment to it is noted, and it is a very good thing. I, too, acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. I also acknowledge the traditional owners from the place I represent, the Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation. and I acknowledge their elders past, present and emerging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, NAIDOC Week was marked locally in a couple of ways. The City of Port Philip together with N'arweet Dr Carolyn Briggs AM, the elder of the Yaluk-ut Weelam clan of the Boonwurrung, celebrated NAIDOC Week. She welcomed country, and there were a number of local events including Uncle Jack Charles doing a guided meditation for those in Port Philip. It truly was a celebration of local Indigenous culture and of Indigenous culture locally. I think it's a wonderful thing that we stopped and celebrated it and marked it. But it is not all just positivity, to be honest. Whenever we stop and speak about Indigenous Australians and the issues that confront them on a daily basis we need to be sombre and note there is much to do. While we are constantly reminded of and renewed in our focus through events and celebrations like NAIDOC Week, we must also be honest and fair about the work that still needs to be done and be critical of the fact we haven't achieved what we should have up until now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme of this year's NAIDOC Week is 'Always Was, Always Will Be'—65,000 years of history of this great country and the fact that we will never ever take that away and we will celebrate that into the future identity of what it is to be Australian. Indigenous Australians understood things that I think that we are still grappling with: how to live sustainably on the land, how to manage water sustainably and how to not take too much from the land on which we live but to live in harmony with our surroundings. We have much to heed from the past and from the thousands of years of civilisation that happened before we all arrived in this country. But, in order to bring that forward and to close some of the truly ugly and awful differences in the life and life expectancy between Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous Australians, we need to listen to the one key thing that Indigenous Australians are asking for, and that is more of a say in their own affairs—more of a say in their own issues and the policies that affect them and their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the coming together in 2017 at Uluru for a remarkable and sincere document, the Uluru Statement from the Heart, it saddens me a little bit that we don't have bipartisan support in full for the Uluru Statement from the Heart—and that is fracturing. There is actually only one political party that supports the Uluru statement in full, and that is not something that I say with pride; that is something I say with disappointment. We stand ready and we await the coalition government to come on board and to not let this be a partisan issue. We gain nothing by having this as a partisan issue, and we need to come together. In fact, a recent survey found that a vast majority, 81 per cent, of Australians are happy for a constitutionally enshrined voice. A voice protected in the Constitution is not something that we should be afraid of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember the hesitation that former Prime Minister Howard had in saying sorry. It became a matter of culture and politics when it didn't need to be. We don't need to be standing here today afraid of what a voice and what listening and respecting the requests of Indigenous Australians means. We can stand here with confidence and engage and build something that is unifying and is embracing of the past and of the future. NAIDOC Week presents us with an opportunity to remind ourselves of that, and I hope we have a better future—and a bipartisan future—on this very front.</span>

This week's NAIDOC Week theme is 'Always Was, Always Will Be'. This theme recognises that Indigenous Australians have occupied and cared for this continent for 65,000 years. Indigenous culture is as important today as it was 65,000 years ago. Indigenous Australians remain spiritually and culturally connected to this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NAIDOC Week provides an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on and understand our nation's shared history and the remarkable and ongoing contribution of our Indigenous people—that it always was and it always will be. Indeed, a greater understanding of the role Indigenous Australians have played in building and shaping the nation we all call home is critical for all Australians. This year we celebrated NAIDOC Week to recognise the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The challenge of COVID-19 meant that this year we came together differently to celebrate our community and history. This was often done virtually or in smaller numbers, but this in no way reduced the significance of this year's celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a medical student, I successfully won an AMA travel scholarship. I used this scholarship to travel to the Northern Territory to investigate the high mortality rates for newborns in our Indigenous population in Arnhem Land. What I saw there shocked me. It mirrored what I had seen on an elective in Kenya just the year before. It was hard to grapple with the stark difference between the remote Indigenous communities I was working in and inner-city Melbourne, where I lived. At the time, child and infant mortality rates were off the scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children born in 1986 had a life expectancy that was dramatically different from non-Indigenous Australians. Fast forward 30 years and there has been marked improvement in outcomes for Indigenous women and their children. This is because of the concerted efforts of consecutive governments from both sides of the aisle. But it is still not good enough, and the rates of mortality remain twice that of non-Indigenous children. More Indigenous mothers are attending antenatal care earlier and more frequently, and there is education about risks such as smoking, which remains lower in women now than it was before. These are important measures that, hopefully, will lead to improved outcomes. You can't just wish for outcomes; you need to take action. It is important that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> report has been refreshed this year by the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and has more ambitions for better outcomes. But the target to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation, by 2031, is still not on track. Indigenous mortality rates have improved at a similar rate to that for non-Indigenous Australians, but unfortunately the gap has not yet narrowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe that education is the key to self-determination, not just for non-Indigenous Australians but, definitely, for Indigenous people too. Education leads to better health and social outcomes for all communities around the world, and the one take-out from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap</span> report that we can celebrate is that, for Indigenous communities, there are better entries of children into prep and there is better retention at year 12. This means that, with more Indigenous and Torres Strait Islanders achieving year 12 or equivalent qualifications, there'll be more of them attending higher education and more of them entering better jobs and better professions. This will lead to better outcomes for the Indigenous population and the wider general community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my first speech, a strong country is one that is at peace with its past. NAIDOC Week is one small, regular but critical annual event in this journey of healing and understanding. I believe that constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians is a critical next step on that road to a stronger future for all Australians. I thank Minister Ken Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Australians, for inviting me to be a member of the parliamentary working group on constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians. NAIDOC Week has evolved into a proud tradition which recognises the remarkable and ongoing contribution of our Indigenous people. Modern Australia must recognise its Indigenous people. This may not be an 'always was', but it most certainly must be an 'always will be'. By reflecting on our past, we can understand the present and look to a better future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  NAIDOC Week is, of course, a fantastic opportunity for the entire country to celebrate our diverse Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and their very long, deep history, which has been across this continent for millennia. There's much to celebrate and there's much that we can all be very proud of. There are also, obviously, things that we are not proud of, but the strength of NAIDOC Week is that we focus on where we've come from, celebrate the incredible First Nations communities that we have in our country and look to the future and to making lives better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During NAIDOC Week, we're here in Canberra for sittings, so, along with colleagues from Labor's First Nations caucus committee, we visited the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services centre in Narrabundah. It was fantastic visit. It is an Aboriginal controlled health service right here in the nation's capital. It was an excellent reminder of the power of Aboriginal controlled health services and of the fantastic results they get. Our First Nations health professionals obviously have a unique insight and are best placed to improve the lives of First Nations people. They have the culturally appropriate way of operating. They know how to get the best results for our First Nations brothers and sisters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Mike Freelander, who is here with us today, along with the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, in the work of our First Nations caucus committee, which has really been pushing this important concept of the first 1,000 days. That is not just limited to First Nations Australians, of course. If all parents create a really healthy environment from antenatal through birth into that postnatal stage, good perinatal health for the mum and the bub is going to give us the healthiest young Australians possible, which should be the aim of all of us. The role of the Aboriginal controlled health centres is that that support during that first thousand days is absolutely essential and is making a huge difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These Aboriginal controlled health organisations around the country are also really empowering our First Nations communities as well as improving their access to health services. In the Top End of Australia––we heard the member for Higgins refer to her eyes being opened whilst visiting the Northern Territory––in my electorate, in Darwin and Palmerston we have a fantastic Aboriginal controlled health centre series of clinics, called Danila Dilba. They do wonderful work. They serve about 80 per cent of our large Indigenous population in the greater Darwin area. They also look after huge numbers of First Nations people, Aboriginals and Territorians that come in from the communities into Darwin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They do a great job. They're reducing strokes and heart attacks, preventing low birth weights and also preventing complications from diabetes. People who engage with Danila Dilba health services are less likely to need to engage with other health services. A Deloitte analysis found that every dollar invested in health services generated a $4 return or benefit to society. That is terrific economics by any measure, and it's terrific humanity by any measure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge Yilli Rreung. When the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was in Darwin recently we visited this great NGO that is helping First Nations people in the accommodation space. I want to acknowledge their CEO, Leeanne Caton, and also congratulate her for being appointed chair of the Aboriginal Benefits Account Advisory Committee. She is a great asset and will do a fantastic job in all her roles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During NAIDOC Week, the Larrakia Nation launched its 'lighting the spark' initiative, which is working with young people to help promote youth entrepreneurship. I want to congratulate Nicole Brown from Larrakia Nation. I want to also congratulate quickly the NT Indigenous Business Network, in particular CEO Jerome Cubillo and Steve Cardona, who are doing a fantastic job helping Indigenous businesses thrive.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often say when beginning my remarks that I'm pleased to be speaking to this motion, but I'm not pleased to have to speak to this motion. I'm not pleased that after seven years these issues are still before the parliament, still unresolved, when they could so easily be resolved. When it comes to our obligations to people seeking our help from places in turmoil around the world there are many issues that are difficult and challenging. We should confront them. We should debate them in this place and in the community thoughtfully and decently, guided by our values. Here we have a simple proposition that, sadly, is not being addressed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is being addressed in the community. That is something that this motion acknowledges: that more than 65,000 people––and I understand more since then––have signed a petition saying that enough is enough and calling on the Morrison government, after seven years, to accept the generous offer made by a former prime minister of New Zealand to resettle these people, found to have been refugees, there to enable them to begin their lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move this motion now to speak to a number of audiences. Firstly, to those refugees who have been trapped in limbo for so long, to say that they are not forgotten in this place; secondly, to say to those who have come together to sign this petition to stand up for their values, Australian values, that they are being listened to, that they are a part of this democracy and their voices matter to many of us in this place. I'm very pleased that this motion is not just a Labor motion; it's a motion that was seconded by my friend the member for Warringah, and I believe it's broadly supported on the crossbench. All of us have different perspectives on this issue and many other issues, but in this case we have come together to say we can do better and that, for this group of vulnerable human beings, enough is enough. I was pleased to stand at the front of Australia's parliament during the last sittings to receive this petition, along with many parliamentary colleagues, and acknowledge the enormous amount of work that Craig Foster and Sonny Bill Williams have done, together with that fantastic group of Australians in Amnesty International Australia, to bring together so many people. I want to recognise their leadership. We hear a lot of talk in this place about Australian values and, in particular, about a fair go. Craig Foster and Sonny Bill Williams have exemplified that in a way that many of us should think about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The core of this issue is the failure of this government to do what is right for a group of vulnerable human beings. For seven years—slightly longer than the time that I've been in this place—New Zealand has offered to resettle the refugees who are on PNG and Nauru. It has now been seven years and 134 days that people have been detained, seemingly endlessly, with all that entails and all the damage to their prospects. We have too often seen the most tragic stories result from that—unimaginable tragedies. These are things that I reflect on more than anything else as I go about my work in this place. I acknowledge that a large number have been resettled in the United States through arrangements that we supported at the time, and I hope those arrangements can be completed. It is heartwarming to hear about lives being rebuilt once people have been resettled. Why have they not been resettled in New Zealand when this is an offer that has been on the table for so long and there is no plausible argument against it being accepted? Too often in this place and too often in this debate we see the purest and basest politics attached to the issue of people seeking asylum in Australia. Too often in the administration of this portfolio we have seen cruelty for only cruelty's sake. Last week, I spoke about Farhad Rahmati, who has been moved around for what appears to be the crime of alerting the Australian community to what is happening, initially in the Kangaroo Point APOD and subsequently at other facilities of detention. Reflecting on him and the contribution he might be making, I again urge government members. I'm very pleased that the member for Berowra will participate in this debate, because we perhaps come at our roles from rather different perspectives. He is a thoughtful and decent man and I'm sure he applies himself to the challenge of this with all the qualities he brings to the other aspects of this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've fundamentally been thinking about the seven years and what's happened in my life—the growth of my children and the significant events that have taken place and the significance that some aspects of my work have brought to me—and I ask myself: what is different for these people? I say to them, for me and for us, enough is enough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  Let me start by acknowledging the member for Scullin and his genuine commitment to these issues and his very kind personal reflection on me. I have great respect for the member for Scullin, but, on this issue, I think we will find ourselves on very much opposite sides. I want to start by looking at the history of this issue and go a bit deeper and a bit longer than the member for Scullin did in his contribution. I go back to the end of John Howard's period in government and remind this parliament that, when John Howard left office, there were four unauthorised maritime arrivals in detention and no children. That's the truth of what happened at that time. On election eve, Kevin Rudd, the opposition leader, said that he backed John Howard's strong border protection policies, but that is not what he proceeded to do when he sat on the Treasury benches. As a result of the policies that Labor brought in during their time in office, over 50,000 people arrived by boat, on 800 boats, and 1,200 people drowned at sea. I never want to forget those people, because they are lives that were needlessly lost because of the failure of the Labor Party's border protection. Eight thousand children were detained. In July 2013, at the end of the Labor years, there were 10,201 people in detention, including almost 2,000 children. Seventeen detention centres needed to be reopened as a result of these failed policies, and the border protection failures cost the taxpayer $17 billion. These are the things we never want to see restart in Australia; we never want to return to this. These policies came about because the Labor Party was not prepared to undertake the tough measures that this government has been able and willing to bring into place that have stopped the boat arrivals. These include the turnbacks, where it's safe to do so, offshore processing and temporary protection visas. These are tough measures, hard measures, but they are measures that have stopped the boats coming and deaths at sea. They are measures that I am proud to support. They've also seen the closure of 19 detention centres and the removal of all children from detention. That's, again, something that we should be proud of in this parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does having a border protection program that actually works allow you to do? It restores public confidence in immigration. That's so important and it allows you, as a result of the restoration of public confidence, to be more generous about your humanitarian program. We went from a period under Labor where we had 13,750 refugees to a period now where we have 18,750 refugees. We've increased the number of refugees from the Syrian conflict, allowing us to take 12,000 refugees. You cannot incorporate people in those situations unless you have public confidence in the program. That is why the tough border protection policies that we've taken and put in place have been so important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Scullin is wrong to say that this matter is unresolved. For people who are genuine refugees, there is the option, if they wish to do so, to be repatriated to their home country or to go to the United States. So far we have resettled over 870 people in the United States. The benefit of our policies is that we've stopped the criminal gangs, we've stopped the people-smuggling gangs, which are looking at what Australia is doing every single day and for any signals that we might restart that particular proposal again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Nauru and Manus, in particular, it's important to remind people that every child has now been removed from Nauru and, of the remaining adults on Nauru or Papua New Guinea, none are in detention. They all live in the local community, and the overwhelming majority are single males. Over 140 of them have been found not to be refugees. As I said, the government is happy to help, including booking and paying for their return travel, if they wish to voluntarily return to their country of origin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the New Zealand offer, the government appreciates this offer but remains focused on completing the United States resettlement arrangement. As I say, this has been a positive arrangement with 870 refugees resettled and further departures expected in the coming weeks and months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to ensuring that people smugglers cannot exploit any resettlement arrangement to market illegal maritime arrivals and illegal maritime ventures and try to bring people in through the back door of New Zealand. Any potential resettlement arrangement must not undermine our ongoing efforts to combat people smuggling. This has been absolutely vital in terms of restoring the reputation of Australia's migration program both here and abroad, and I commend the government's program.</span>

                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I can only say that the member for Berowra has done the same old thing: trotted out the political games, blamed the other side but ignored the very real issue—seven years in detention. All members who condone that should be ashamed of themselves. I thank the member for Scullin for bringing forward this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many others in this place, I received the petition referenced in the motion, signed by over 65,000 people, calling on the Prime Minister to accept the New Zealand offer and resettle the remaining refugees. Currently, there are 290 people remaining in Papua New Guinea and on Manus Island. There is an offer from New Zealand to take up to 150 asylum seekers from PNG and Manus and that offer has been on foot for seven years. This could have all been dealt with by now. There would be no refugees left in PNG or Manus, had we taken up the offer back in 2013 when it was first made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all due respect to the member for Berowra, what he just said to this House is just an insult to proper management of people who are in distress and being held without proper process. We're keeping refugees in indefinite detention without hope of release or knowledge of where they will ever call home. They've suffered immensely. They're separated from their families and loved ones. They've been left without hope for seven years and are destitute—physically and emotionally. I was proud to have represented Australia on numerous occasions on the world scene, but I'm definitely not proud of this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Craig Foster is not proud of this, nor are Sonny Bill Williams and many others. There are stories and videos on the gameover.org.au website, and I'd urge you all to go and watch them. Listen to Adam's story, Samad's story and Moz's story, and then tell me again why you think these people should be kept in indefinite detention. Mohammed is a former farmer from Sudan. He hasn't seen his two young daughters for seven years. One he has never met. She was born after he left. He worries about them every minute of every day. While locked up on Manus, his wife was murdered. He found that out during a short weekly call he was allowed to make, and he will have to live with that reality for years. He has been stranded on Port Moresby, and he is tired and sick beyond his endurance. He just wants his freedom so that he can rebuild his life. His is just one of many stories collected by the Game Over campaign, being championed by Craig Foster, Sonny Bill Williams, Amnesty International and many others. We all need to call time on the seven years of detention that these refugees have suffered and demand that the government finally accept the offer on the table from New Zealand. It is absolute rubbish to stand in this place and justify this ongoing cruel policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Offshore detention and the management of facilities are costing Australian taxpayers over a billion dollars a year. I would urge the Morrison government to consider how that money could be better spent in standing up for humanitarian conduct and taking proper care of what needs to be done at home. Last month I spoke on this issue with a Nangami peace and justice group that I met with, and I reiterated their calls for more funding for the Status Resolution Support Services program. Another group I recently met with was an on-arrival detainee support group. They're highlighting the plight of refugees in alternative places of detention who were brought to Australia under medevac legislation—and we know how well that's working out for them. They've raised their concerns around an inability for people to be referred for specialist health treatment. One of those is Moz, a Kurdish refugee who escaped his home after a siege. He is a talented musician who has inspired many others through his songwriting. He dreams of a life filled with music. He spent seven years in Papua New Guinea, with severe asthma, until he was medevac'd at the end of 2019. But instead of getting the treatment he requires Moz remains trapped in a hotel, unable to leave, with no knowledge of what's next. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With due respect to government members—and I would say this to both sides of this chamber, as both parties have condoned policies that have been incredibly inhumane on legitimate refugees—whilst we take a completely perverse approach to these people seeking asylum, we have an influx of people coming in through the airlines and coming by other means. It's time we called time on this policy. These people deserve to be resettled. Accept the New Zealand offer and get on with it: call game over.</span>

Right now, as we are hit hard by the economic fall-out of the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of business profit to income is at its highest in 60 years and the share of workers' wages to profit is at its lowest. People are working harder but wages growth is flatlining and too many people, especially young people, aren't getting the hours of work they want and need to live a decent life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's proposed plans to reform our workplace laws look likely to leave millions of workers behind, and entrench low-paid and insecure work. The government's unambitious unemployment target of six per cent shows they are content with leaving two million people either without work or without enough work. Working people are under attack and have less certainty and rights at work than ever before, while insecure work is spreading the coronavirus. Meanwhile, corporations are exploiting loopholes and making profits by underpaying workers. As someone who spent several years representing low-paid workers before getting elected to parliament, I know the damage done by insecure work. The Greens will fight tooth and nail against the government's proposed changes. We need to make sure everyone has a job if they want one as well as a living wage, while we tackle job insecurity and restore workers' basic rights.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  On the weekend I had the great pleasure of attending an important milestone in the history of the New South Wales Liberal Party, the 75th Anniversary of the New South Wales Young Liberal Movement. It is an organisation that, as a former federal and state president, is close to my heart. The history of the New South Wales Young Liberal Movement is one of great political activism and it has always been the conscience of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. It has also been an incredible incubator for talent in the Liberal Party. I am proud of the fact that the first elected president of the New South Wales Young Liberals was one John Howard. It has all gone downhill since then but, nonetheless, he was our finest Prime Minister in my lifetime. Since then he has been joined by people in parliament, including, in the current parliament, the member for McKellar, the member for Mitchell and our foreign minister and, in the New South Wales parliament, people like our premier, the honourable Don Harwin, Andrew Constance, Shayne Mallard, Catherine Cusack, Scott Farlow and Natasha Maclaren-Jones. They follow a fine tradition of leadership including people like Phillip Ruddock, John Brogden and our former Prime Minister John Howard. I want to congratulate the outgoing president, Chaneg Torres, and the incoming president, Hugo Robinson, who I know will do an outstanding job. I encourage anyone interested in politics to get involved in the youth movements of political parties and, hopefully, make the right decision and join the young Liberals.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Last week I was privileged to visit B'nai B'rith in Kensington in my electorate and met with some of their fantastic volunteers to hear about their Courage to Care program. Courage to Care is an outreach program by B'nai B'rith, the world's oldest Jewish service organisation, which aims to inform Australians of the dangers and prejudice of discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1999, Courage to Care in New South Wales has run a travelling educational exhibition inspired by the many stories of rescue and courage displayed by non-Jews who saved or helped Jews during the Holocaust. A unique feature of all Courage to Care programs is a session with a living historian, a survivor from the Holocaust, who shares their positive story of their rescue and survival and who explains the support he or she was given by others. I was fortunate to meet with Ernie Freelander, who told how he and his mother escaped the concentration camps due to the humanity of a German soldier and were the only two in their family to survive. The program celebrates the people who had the courage to care, ordinary people whose acts were extraordinary in bravery and impact. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Courage to Care in New South Wales is run by a team of nearly 100 volunteers and, with the help of a Kingsford Smith volunteers grant, they have been able to support the teaching of more antidiscrimination programs in our community. I would like to thank and congratulate all the volunteers from Courage to Care who help individuals and people in our communities stand up to prejudice.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Today I want to give a shout-out to the amazing work of the Rural Fire Service volunteers, particularly those in my electorate of Longman. I recently attended the 30th anniversary celebration and open day for the Rocksberg Moorina Rural Fire Station, which was very well attended and well supported by the local community. A significant part of my electorate is classed as rural and we are blessed to have 381 RFS volunteers across nine stations in Longman. Volunteers in Rocksberg Moorina, Wamuran, Toorbul, Delaneys Creek, Mount Mee, Stanmore, Stoney Creek, Narangba and Palmerston all do great work in their communities. They help raise awareness about what to do when fire strikes and can be called into action when needed. If any Australians, particularly those living in rural, semi-rural or urban fringe areas, need a reminder to get fire prepared, they need only look to the fires raging right now on Fraser Island and elsewhere. The RFS has many online resources that can help residents prepare for the worst of the bushfire season. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the RFS is an organisation that relies heavily on volunteers. In fact, there are about 35,000 RFS volunteers across Australia in a whole range of different roles. They receive training that may one day help save a person's life or a family's home. If anyone out there wants to lend a hand, I know they would be welcomed with open arms.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I wish to raise a matter of importance to Greek Australians in Victoria and Greek Australians in my electorate. The Greek diaspora contribution to Australia is long and proud. From the time of the waves of immigration, especially but not limited to after the Second World War, the suburbs of Melbourne and the communities of Australia were very fortunate that so many Greeks chose Australia as their home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is terribly important that young Greek Australians don't lose touch with the culture of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. So it is with much sadness that I learnt that La Trobe University is terminating its modern Greek language program. It is the only tertiary institution in Victoria providing modern Greek language teaching. Modern Greek should be part of our secondary school curriculum. But what will be the point of that if students can't take their study of modern Greek to university level? This is a great cultural loss. It is a great loss of contribution of the diaspora and it is a great loss of the Australian Greek story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of a bigger trend, where universities aren't being properly funded for the humanities. We have seen the cost of arts degrees going up and we're seeing pressure on languages. We don't want to see the death of language teaching in our universities and higher education. I call upon La Trobe University to change course straightaway. We will not give up fighting for modern Greek language teaching at La Trobe and in Victoria.</span>

The fake image misrepresents a soldier murdering a child. The Chinese Communist Party's Tweet has rightly been described by the Prime Minister as 'repugnant' and 'shameful' and he said that they should be 'ashamed' of this post. It is welcomed to know that this condemnation is bipartisan, with similar sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Lijian Zhao, removes any ambiguity that it was the indulgence of a rogue official by Tweeting it from his account. The Australian government and the Chinese Communist Party may not always see eye to eye on important issues but, even in the most heated disagreements, there is no proximity in parallel. Normally in our disagreement, we are respectful to ensure that anything we say avoids China losing face. Today, the Chinese Communist Party removed it from itself.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Last Saturday I joined with locals outside St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne to mark what was then 800 days that Kylie Moore-Gilbert had been held in Iran. Outside St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne were 800 butterflies representing the good wishes of people in Australia thinking of Kylie in prison in Iran and sending their best to her. It was pretty amazing news to hear that Kylie was then freed. I acknowledge the member for Wentworth, who sent remarks—obviously it was in Melbourne and he couldn't be there—and Senator Rice, who joined us on the day. My message today is that, despite those 800 days, Kylie should know that her friends and family did not forget her at any point. Many of them were knocking on our doors and seeking for us and for Australia to do more to have Kylie freed. Today I say thank you to everyone from the government and the department who was involved in helping to free Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert. It is a wonderful thing that she is home. We never, ever believed that she was there for a good reason, and we're very pleased that she is now free in Australia, where she belongs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Esperance is a tight-knit coastal town, and its sense of community and service is second to none. Given its isolation, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is greatly appreciated by the Esperance community, and several groups fundraise year-round to help keep the doctor flying. One of those groups is the Royal Flying Doctor Service Firewood Cutters. At the invitation of Steve Smith, I recently visited the firewood cutters to see firsthand this impressive initiative. I was warmly greeted by their president, Neil Livingstone, who gave me a tour of their set-up. Their wood yard is co-located on the property of McD Contracting, and the firewood cutters are supported by many other local businesses. On Monday and Wednesday mornings, you'll find a group of 28 retired cutters, along with a couple of shift workers, running three wood splitters, several chainsaws and a mobile saw bench. Together, the team donate their considerable talents and time to this worthy cause. I was blown away to hear that, so far this year, the sale of their firewood has resulted in over $85,000 in donations to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It was great to chat to Neil, David Ovans and Steve Bull about the importance of the Royal Flying Doctor Service to their community. I understand there is also a social aspect to the group, with the firewood cutters rewarded for their hard work with a beer and a barbecue after each shift. What a fantastic initiative, raising funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while fostering connection between their members and the local community. I commend the Esperance RFDS Firewood Cutters for their service and thank them for their part in keeping the doctor flying.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Yesterday was the completion of a month-long T20 cricket tournament. I was invited by local community leader Satya Yelisetti to join the Springfield Lions Cricket Club. It was the club's first time holding the final tournament awards event. It was fantastic to see members from all parts of Springfield and the surrounding suburbs, who are from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and communities, come together over a common love of cricket. Sporting clubs and groups work hard to promote community, a place to belong and a great environment for those who share an interest. There are over 70 sporting clubs in the Oxley electorate, and they are certainly growing. It's been an incredibly tough year for sport and recreation clubs around the country, who have been unable to meet or even, at times, play contact sport during the COVID-19 restrictions. Club managers, coaches, parents and presidents have all done a fantastic job in keeping up a sense of community connection and involvement throughout the pandemic and have still managed to find innovative ways to increase community involvement and stay connected. I want to congratulate all of the volunteers who have worked so hard during the pandemic to keep community sport, including kids' sport, alive. I look forward to seeing all that is ahead for the Springfield Lions Cricket Club, a new club in my electorate, who are there helping to create fantastic opportunities for our community to come together. I put on record my thanks to everyone for helping put together a wonderful event. I look forward to sharing many more in the area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Upgrades to the Terrigal Trojans clubhouse have now been completed. The project was partly funded by a $275,000 grant through the National Stronger Regions Fund, and the clubhouse was refurbished with the help of a whole group of volunteers, business owners and local tradespeople. Improvements include a new separate function room, outdoor terrace, eating area, two bars and kitchen. I've got no doubt that this popular facility will bring even more opportunities to our region, not only for sport but also for functions and community events right in the heart of Terrigal. I recently joined some of the club's talented players and executives to hear about what this meant for amateur sports on the Central Coast. The captain of the first-grade team, Sam Kenny, said that the new clubhouse had created a real sense of community and will help attract even more young players. He said it was great to have space for club memorabilia to showcase the many fantastic achievements of fellow team mates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Stevens, president of the Trojans rugby club, said that the upgrade was possible with the dedication of club members and local supporters. Local businesses worked free of charge or at heavily discounted rates to help transform the building, providing services and materials like roof sheeting, gyprocking and structural beams. He put it perfectly when he said that the clubhouse was built by the community for the community. To John Stevens, the Terrigal Rugby Club—the Trojans—and everyone involved in creating this fantastic facility for our community to gather, enjoy and call their own, I say thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  According to the energy minister, the Morrison government has 'strong targets, clear plans and an enviable track record' on reducing emissions. Some might take that at face value, but, coming from the minister that brought us 'Grassgate', 'Watergate' and 'Clovergate', I thought I'd see what some experts have to say. The NewClimate Institute ranked Australia dead-last out of 57 countries for climate policy. Climate Action Tracker say Australia's climate policies are 'insufficient' to meet the agreements we signed up to in Paris. Deloitte find that climate inaction will cost Australia $3 trillion and nearly one million jobs. The Investor Group on Climate Change estimates that three-quarters of Australia's trade is with countries that have pledged to reach net zero by mid-century, which we have not. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate </span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ransparency report</span> ranked Australia in the bottom bracket in every climate policy area but one, finding Australia had one of the highest shares of fossil fuel use, per-capita emissions three times the G20 average, and ranked highly for vulnerability to climate risk. The coalition government has had 22 energy policies in the last eight years, and the hopeless, hapless minister has no policies that will reduce emissions or power prices and deal with the catastrophic risk that faces Australia more than any other advanced nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  The closure of Australia's international border has amplified pre-existing workforce challenges in the horticultural industry in my electorate of Mallee. The industry faces a shortfall of thousands of workers until international labour can once again be employed. Although worsened by COVID-19, these challenges are not new. The industry is heavily reliant on overseas workers because low-skilled, semi-skilled and skilled labour supplies have always been a challenge for our region and our industries. Last week, I convened a webinar for horticultural producers and contractors in my electorate to discuss current visa options and the Horticulture Industry Labour Agreement. The webinar was joined by representatives from the Department of Home Affairs. Those present have decades worth of experience in horticulture and associated labour hire industries. There was clear frustration and they expressed confusion with current visa processes. Nathan Falvo suggested that decentralising the department responsible could be worth considering. I agreed. As part of the agenda of decentralisation, I am eager to establish a Home Affairs hub in Mildura—why not?—to service the complex workforce needs of business in the region and support the thousands of migrant workers that come to work on our farms. A Home Affairs hub would be an important step towards improving a government mechanism to manage workforce shortages and red tape complexities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Yesterday afternoon, I had the pleasure of attending a ceremony hosted by Moorooka's Clifton Hill Scout Group, alongside Minister Mark Bailey. It was a warm afternoon, but the local scouting movement had plenty of excitement and pride over what was to take place: Venturer Scout Georgia Thomas was being presented with a Queen's Scout Award. This is the highest youth award achievement in the Scout movement in the Commonwealth. It has four main areas, including leadership development, personal growth, outdoor activities and community involvement. Georgia joined the Scout movement as a Joey when she was six years old. Her two brothers are also Scouts and both spoke yesterday. It's taken Georgia two years to complete the work needed for this award and she was very gracious when accepting this honour. While the Queen's Scout Award is an individual award, Georgia very generously attributed her success to the Clifton Hill Scout Group. She talked of the support and friendship she has gained over her years as a Scout and how the Scouts helped her overcome her shyness, develop leadership skills and team work, and gain the confidence to speak to audiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Becoming a Queen's Scout is no mean feat. Georgia's also just managed to complete her last year of high school last week in a most difficult year—in fact she was taught by my good friend John Carozza who Georgia spoke very highly of. Georgia is the eighth Clifton Hill Venturer Scout to receive a Queen's Scout Award in the last three years, so it shows that the leaders at Clifton Hill Scout Group are doing great work. Congratulations, Georgia.</span>

Today we are seeing new residents from an ever broader and more diverse range of countries and cultures. I recently had the pleasure of meeting more of these new migrants through a series of morning teas organised in conjunction with Stella Romagnoli, Caloundra Community Centre's multicultural worker. I sat down with the coast's newest residents at two events at the community centre in Baringa and one in Caloundra. We had some robust and useful discussions about issues faced by new migrants and their ambitions for the future. Already Stella is helping to create an emerging migrant welcome centre group to build on this momentum. </span>

On behalf of all Fisher residents, I welcome all of our new migrants to the Sunshine Coast and wish them all the best for their new future as part of our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  I've often spoken about my concern about loneliness, which is a crisis that affects too many Australians. It's been a particularly acute crisis throughout the pandemic. Before we'd even heard of COVID, one in four Australians reported feeling lonely some or all of the time. We know this isn't just something that's of vague concern; it has very significant health consequences as well as life course consequences. It damages communities as well as individual lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was shocked but, sadly, not surprised by research indicating that statistics for loneliness have doubled over the course of the lockdown experience that has characterised the pandemic for so many Australians. I found this out when I had the great honour of launching Australia's first white paper on loneliness produced by the Ending Loneliness Together coalition last week. This is a shocking statistic but one of many. It shows us how much work we have to do to better understand how loneliness impacts Australians and the great diversity that is modern Australia. It shows us that we have much work to do to build an evidence base to allow us to put public policies in place that will effectively target loneliness. It shows that we have more to do in terms of listening and respecting experiences of loneliness and treating them with the seriousness that they deserve. Loneliness is a killer.</span>

While this year has been a trying one for us all, it has brought out the best in our community. To recognise this, earlier this year I put the call out for the community to nominate those who went above and beyond to support others for a local Bonner legend award. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the call-out we received some heartwarming nominations, and last Monday we celebrated these incredible people and learnt more about what motivated them to be so kind, caring and compassionate to others. Amongst them were neighbours, volunteers and members of our everyday community who just didn't know how their actions had made such a difference to the lives of others. This included Brisbane coastguards who keep our boaties safe on Moreton Bay and Darling Point Special School's Coral Brenner, who runs the before-and-after-school program. </span>

These are the people in our community nominated by our community for the amazing work that they do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  Throughout this year we've repeatedly heard the term 'essential workers'. Today I would like to add my congratulations to a Bean constituent who's firmly in that category, communicating life-saving information to members of our community. Amanda Dolejsi was one of the finalists for the 2021 ACT Local Hero, a category within the Australian of the Year Awards, for her work as an Auslan interpreter. This recognition demonstrates the depth of Amanda's work in this field and her commitment to it. She is the ACT's only fully certified Auslan interpreter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She began her Auslan journey early, as a result of having a childhood friend who was deaf. The past year has been fraught, with disasters, bushfires and a global pandemic. Throughout it all, Amanda has stood next to local and national government officials and ministers, ensuring that all citizens of the ACT and more broadly receive the vital and life-saving information that is being broadcast. She's a champion for those who speak Auslan and she's passionate about ensuring that they receive exactly the same message that the hearing community receives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At our morning tea with Amanda, she spoke candidly about the fact that there's a shortage of qualified Auslan interpreters and not enough support for training or career paths, despite the need for interpreters across emergency services and the need for fair access to our health and justice systems. Governments at all levels need to do more for all our interpreting services. Congratulations again Amanda. You're an amazing constituent of Bean.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  On Friday, I visited Montello Primary School. Miss Howard and Mr Langford's grade 5 classes are studying government and democracy. They're also starting to think about what jobs they might look to do when they leave school. Let me tell you, you couldn't find a bunch of more enthusiastic, smart and fun kids than these grade 5s at Montello Primary School. We started the session by looking at the role of media in my office. The students showed us that they already had outstanding writing skills and social media skills, and they developed a Facebook post and joint media release about our visit. I then had a chat to them about what I do in Braddon as a federal representative. We talked about how parliament works and how different tiers of government work and how that's important for them as kids.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Montello Primary School has done a great job nurturing these people. I know that sitting in the classrooms are our region's future leaders, and maybe even the nation's future leaders. I want to remind students that, when it comes to jobs, the sky's the limit. You can do and achieve whatever you are prepared to work hard to do. Thank you, Miss Howard and Mr Langford and all the great kids, for making me so welcome at your school, Montello Primary School.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Last Wednesday a purple bench appeared on the verandah outside the Harris Park Community Centre. It's part of the purple bench project, which is part of an international project, 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. The project honours the memory of people murdered by their partner or family by creating awareness and starting a conversation about the issue of domestic violence in Australia. The bench will be a feature at the front of the community centre, with information flyers, and a second bench will appear in various parts of Parramatta, in restaurants and retail outlets, to remind us that at least one woman every week is murdered by a partner in Australia—one a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the large number of people who were involved in this project. Stella Zikpi, a social work student from the Western Sydney University, painted the benches and did a great job. It really is an amazing colour. The Harris Park Community Centre manager and white ribbon ambassador, Patrick Soosay, who says he wants to shine a light on domestic violence—in particular, on dowry abuse—has been behind this project from the start. Dowry abuse advocate, Kittu Randhawa, the founder of the Indian (Sub-Continent) Crisis and Support Agency, has been working alongside the community on their upcoming projects. Finally, Nikhil Seth helped create the program and is working on a range of new ones. Well done Harris Park Community Centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Last Saturday I had the privilege of being invited to Calvary Christian Church's Movember men's breakfast. It was fantastic to see men's mental health issues front and centre on the agenda. This event consisted of a slow-cooked BBQ breakfast, which gave me a chance to chat with other blokes. As you can tell, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, I think I overindulged. It also featured a panel of people who have endured their own mental health challenges. It was an honour to join celebrity chef Matt Golinski, who tragically lost his wife and three daughters in a house fire, and former Cowboys winger Antonio Winterstein, who has had his own challenges. These men have had firsthand experience of what it's like to feel the lows and to need some extra support, but they also reached out to get the help they needed to come out the other side. It was great to hear their stories. They also shared with the group the need to keep up their mental health fitness and to continue to look after themselves as they carry on with their careers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a great morning and an excellent reminder for blokes to not bottle things up but to speak up and speak out. More and more men are realising that it's okay not to be okay. By talking about mental illness and the importance of mental health, we can go a long way towards preventing long-term problems. I know that this event will have started long and important conversations, and I look forward to supporting this event next year.</span>

All Australians can come to the NT without the need to quarantine. I'm so proud of the role that Darwin has played this year in serving as a national hub of repatriation, processing and onboarding during our greatest health crisis in living memory. We played a major role from the outset of this crisis by repatriating Australians from Wuhan in China to Howard Springs in Darwin. The Territory stepped up again by welcoming 180 Australians off the <span style="font-style:italic;">Diamond Princess</span> cruise ship. I'm proud of our role now in receiving Qantas repatriation flights from India, the UK, Singapore, France and Germany to start flying all those Australians who are stranded overseas home. The planes land in Darwin, and passengers spend two weeks at the Howard Springs quarantine facility. This facility is maintained by the NT government and is vital to our national interest. It would be great if we could do even more for this effort. The federal government should support the Territory if it wants to increase our burden-sharing capacity in future crises. Well done to the Northern Territory government. We stand ready to help the nation in the future.</span>

About 10 or 11 days ago we had some concerning developments regarding a coronavirus outbreak in South Australia. The state government made the decision last Wednesday to put the whole state into a form of very significant lockdown, which we thought might last six days. It involved all of us needing to stay at home with our loved ones and do our best to stomp on that outbreak as quickly as possible. Thankfully it only lasted three days, and some developments meant that the restrictions could be lifted. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank everyone in my electorate and my community, all the people of Adelaide and all the people of South Australia. We really came together and understood the need to take urgent and significant action early, because if you act early on these things you can avoid longer-term, much more significant impacts, not just from a health point of view but from an economic point of view. So I thank my community. Unfortunately we're not out of the woods yet. There are still some examples of the virus being contracted by close contacts of those in the cluster, but the health experts have got that under control. They've got in quarantine a lot of people that are at risk of being infected. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  Year 7 students at Bede Polding College in South Windsor have overcome one of the most challenging years in their school careers, and they're helping others in need. Their first year at high school hasn't been anything like what they would have expected, but these inspiring kids have still been able to focus on social justice, helped by a visit from Zoe Grant of the Jesuit Refugee Service. They were so motivated by what they learnt that they've organised a food drive to help refugees and asylum seekers. In an email to me, Chelsea Privitera, on behalf of her fellow students, told me, 'We're doing this because year 7s feel sympathy towards the less fortunate, and we knew we needed to step up and do something.' They believed it was important because, 'for refugees and asylum seekers in Western Sydney, the heat, the weather and the COVID-19 pandemic have inevitably taken a toll on their already stressful and hard lives,' Chelsea wrote. 'The students are bundling food and toiletry items into packages to be distributed by the Jesuit Refugee Service.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These kids have risen to the challenge of overcoming their own problems and are giving others a helping hand. Bede encourages students to strive for excellence and to equip themselves with the skills and passion to make a difference in the community and that's what these kids are doing. I would like congratulation them for not only raising awareness of the struggles that refugees and asylum seekers face but for taking practical steps to help. Congratulations, year 7.</span>

It was fantastic to see local residents out supporting local small businesses and community organisations. Everything for sale was made locally, from handmade jewellery by Junction 44—a local business in The Gap—to freshly made cinnamon donuts from the Ashgrove/The Gap Lions Club, which my son, Theo, enjoyed immensely. In the lead-up to Christmas, it is very easy to get swept up in the online deals and the department store sales, but this year we can make a difference to local businesses and, in turn, local jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses in my electorate and across Australia have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must support them this Christmas. I am starting a Christmas in Ryan campaign in my electorate to encourage my constituents to buy their Christmas gifts from local businesses and retailers. Each day in December, I will be highlighting a local business in Ryan and encouraging others to do the same to support them. Day 1 will start with Tickled Pink Design, a local business creating beautiful handmade newborn and toddler clothing and accessories. Natalie from Auchenflower runs an online store and sets up at local markets around Brisbane. My four-month-old baby girl, Izzie, is a big fan of her clothes. If you are looking at gifting baby clothes this Christmas, please check out Tickled Pink Design and support local. More than that, support local venues if you are going to have a Christmas party, support local vendors. The message for all of us is to get behind our local businesses this Christmas to give them the boost they need this festive season.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I stand today to call on the City of Greater Geelong and its councillors to listen to residents of Curlewis, who are expressing grave safety concerns about a recently built local road, Tivoli Drive. This is a long, straight, undulating road with several blind spots. Large trucks travel both ways to get to new developments, and horns are blasted as cars must pull over because the road is too narrow to cope with parked vehicles. It is noisy, it is dangerous and something needs to be done now. Many constituents have reached out to me and labelled the road as a dangerous horror. I have written to councillors and the CEO requesting action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my constituents Merv Finger said the increased traffic, incessant noise and lack of safety have become a nightmare for residents. I urge the council to listen to these residents and to resolve this serious safety issue as soon as possible. I do acknowledge that the City of Greater Geelong has reduced the speed limit to 50 kilometres an hour, and speed bumps are set to be built in December, but this is plainly not enough. My constituents say this is an accident waiting to happen, but the city says the road won't be widened for another five years. Five years is unacceptable; the current plan is unacceptable. The community cannot wait any longer, and many residents are selling up. I will continue to stand with local residents and urge the council to take immediate action.</span>

I want to commend at this point the personal courage, strength and resilience shown by Dr Moore-Gilbert, who had to undergo an ordeal that none of us could ever imagine or foresee, and also her family, who have suffered largely in silence while maintaining hope and a vigil for her fate. I also want to thank the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the many officials throughout the Australian government who have been involved in these negotiations now for two years, and Kylie's colleagues, friends and students who organised themselves in the Free Kylie Gilbert-Moore campaign to highlight the cause. It was important for Kylie to know she was never forgotten throughout her time in Iran.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Though we are relieved at her release, we should remember exactly what has gone on here. Kylie was an Australian academic visiting Iran at the invitation of an Iranian university to undergo studies. She was detained, she was imprisoned and she was tried in secret, on evidence that we never got to see, with an ineffective and improper legal counsel. She was never given a fair go and she never should have been held for one day, never mind 800 days. This practice from Iran of arbitrary detention and arrest of foreign nationals and hostage-taking simply has to stop. </span>

Meanwhile, on Manus Island and in various motels here in Australia there are asylum seekers who are entering their seventh year without liberty and without certainty about their future. Needless to say, they are unwell, because they have been subjected to circumstances that produce hopelessness, anxiety, self-harm and worse. They are men like Amin Afravi, with whom I spoke via the telephone the other day. They only want a future; they want an end to the punishing limbo which costs taxpayers something like $350,000 for each person a year. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't have to be that way. The government can accept the opportunity to resettle asylum seekers in New Zealand. It can choose to allow Priya and Nades and their children to come home to Biloela. I ask them to do that. It doesn't need to be a Christmas miracle. At the end of a dark year, it could simply be an act of grace, a gesture of common sense and compassion.</span>

South Australia will be badly hit by this, given that we are the biggest wine-producing state in Australia and the home of many of the premium brands which have been finding their way to China on the back of a free trade agreement. The fact that they have said that Australians are dumping wine there is beyond ludicrous, quite frankly. We can't produce wine all that cheaply in Australia. We don't have that kind of low-cost economy. In fact, the product that has been finding its way into China in recent times has been the higher end of the market. There are no cheap giveaways there. There are no great subsidies for agriculture in Australia. Given their actions in other areas, it appears clear now that there is more to this than meets the eye in the terms of trade. I have been very careful not to try to stir up any kind of antagonism. We take one thing at a time and we deal with the issues individually. But there is certainly a large back bank, if you like, of actions they are taking across timber, iron, coal, barley and now wine, which would indicate that there are other drivers in this particular outcome. It's deeply regrettable.</span>

So today I rise to congratulate Wendy Roberts, a local volunteer with the Rural Fire Service, for her 58 years of dedicated service to the people of the New South Wales South Coast. Wendy is a true pillar of our community. Not only has she been with her local Erowal Bay brigade, now amalgamated into the Crossroads brigade, for more than half a century; she has also spent 38 years with the Jervis Bay Lions Club, as well as dedicating herself to the local Girl Guides, Camp Quality and Meals on Wheels. She has spent time helping and supporting others because she loves to do that. She is an inspiration to us all and deserves our recognition and praise. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was so thrilled to see Wendy named Rotary's national emergency services community volunteer winner recently. It was definitely a tough pool, with so many amazing volunteers who have stepped up this year to support our community. I was proud to see Wendy receive this recognition for her tremendous years of service to the South Coast community. Thank you, Wendy, for everything you have done to help and support others. Volunteers like you make our community a better place, and there has never been a better place than the South Coast. Well done, also, to all our amazing volunteers who were nominated for this award. You are all stars this year. </span>

Aunty Eileen was a Yugambeh elder and traditional owner and a descendant of Bilin Bilin, also known as the King of Logan. She grew up in and around Mount Gravatt and Holland Park with her two sisters, Robyn and Loris, and three brothers. We are lucky to have a record of Auntie Eileen's life, shared through our Aunties and Uncles Digital Stories project, which Logan City Council conducted a few years ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important aspect of Aunty Eileen's life was that it was devoted to serving our community and, in particular, seeking to make life better for women and children in our community, particularly Indigenous women and children. Aunty Eileen's father was from Beaudesert—he was a Mununjali man—and her mother grew up in Cherbourg, under the Aboriginal protection act. Family was particularly important to Aunty Eileen, and with her sister Robyn—and I checked this on the transcript of the project—they referred to themselves as the 'black Brady Bunch'. Aunty Eileen spoke Yugambeh language and taught language in local schools. I want to extend my deep condolences to Aunty Eileen's family and all of the lives that she touched during her life.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's environment is in decline. Today, as we're about to head into summer, Australians are anxiously following the news of some of the first of the season's bushfires. They're looking to the nation's government to take a stand for wildlife, but national icons like the koala have died in record numbers and environment department funding has been slashed by 40 per cent. Successive ministers have run the department into the ground, and the Morrison government, frankly, has very little idea what has happened to our threatened species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion I've moved today calls for new developments in koala habitat areas to be stopped unless and until the government gets its act together on koala conservation. There's no national koala conservation strategy. In fact there hasn't been since the last one ran out, in 2014. There are 171 outstanding threatened species recovery plans, of which 170 are overdue. The koala is among the species for which a threatened species recovery plan is well overdue. It was originally due to be created by 2015. It's now 2020, and still there's no sign of a recovery plan from this government. There's also no threat abatement plan that is relevant to the koala, despite the threats to this iconic native species. Koala populations in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT were listed as vulnerable in 2012. In 2019 and 2020, the national bushfire crisis raged throughout the land, burning millions of hectares of land and killing or displacing three billion animals, tens of thousands of koalas among them. Yet the government waited until the September just gone—a year after the national bushfire crisis kicked off—to formally request that the koala be considered for up-listing to a higher conservation status. A New South Wales inquiry found that the koala is heading for extinction in that state by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is good enough. This passed 'good enough' a long time ago. I don't want future generations to have to learn about koalas in the history books, but that's the path that we're on right now. I don't want to lose this national iconic species, and I don't want to lose all of our other threatened species either. The government should put the brakes on any yet-to-commence development in koala habitat areas. Loss of habitat is a key threat to the koala, and that was true even before the national bushfire crisis burnt so much of Australia's land. The government should get the up-listing sorted out and put the threatened species recovery plan in place. This should be done urgently. And, of course, they should finally get around to replacing the National Koala Conservation and Management Strategy. It expired six years ago. It's time the government got their act together on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once these instruments exist, they can assist the government, along with scientific and other expert advice, in understanding how best to conserve the koala. The government should listen to the science. The parliament shouldn't have to step in and say, 'We better put a stop on development because you haven't got your act together.' Actually, the government should be listening to science and getting the instruments in place that can conserve the koala. The fact is that right now we are in a policy vacuum. Parliament shouldn't have to do it, but we do because the government has been so poor at taking action to support and conserve the koala. Until the instruments that are informed by that science exist, we are in a policy vacuum and new development shouldn't go ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put this motion on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> back in early November. Since then, the government has come up with a hastily cobbled together package of reannounced funding to support koalas. In it is a $2 million koala census. Labor has been calling for a national ecological audit since the height of the fires, when we made the call in January 2020. It should not have taken the Morrison government until November 2020 to undertake an audit, albeit only of the Koala population. The bushfire crisis was quickly followed by the pandemic and the recession, but neither of those crises is an excuse for failing to deal with the consequences of the bushfires, and neither is an excuse for being slow to act on the urgent priority that is saving Australia's koalas. One of this government's big problems is that it is always there for the photo-op and never there for the follow-up. We're certainly seeing that in relation to koalas. At the May 2019 election they promised up to $6 million for a major koala initiative. We're still waiting for that to be continued to roll out. The government must do better at protecting this national icon.</span>

There are many things in this chamber and across the chamber that we can agree on, and I think one of those is that the koala is one of our iconic species. We see the koala in all forms. We see them printed on mugs and tea towels when they get sold to tourists and locals alike. We see them on our TV screens, in the form of <span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">inky Bill</span>, the iconic children's TV show that graced our television screens for every decade. They come in chocolate form with caramel inside. And they come in a foam suit—I'm referring to Borobi, the mascot for the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. They are very much an iconic species, and we as a nation need to do everything possible to protect and preserve them for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our duty to preserve and maintain our environment for future generations to enjoy and ensure they have the opportunity to enjoy our natural environment as we do. I think that's one thing in this place we can all agree on. What we may not agree on is how we get there. But, unlike those opposite, members on this side of the House have a record to stand on when it comes to not only protecting koalas but looking after our environment. We actually have a very good record. One of the things we don't do is talk about it very well, but we do have a very good record in the environmental space more generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last year we announced the delivery of over $3 million to the Australia Zoo, the Queensland RSPCA and Currumbin Wildlife Hospital, providing each with over $1 million in funding for each hospital to create an important network of services to support koala populations. These animal hospitals are located in areas of high koala population and, sadly, were largely affected by last year's bushfires in Queensland. We've supported these hospitals and we're delivering the funding to show and support the great work that they are doing in helping our koala population in South-East Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, Dr Michael Pyne, Senior Veterinarian at Currumbin Wildlife Hospital, welcomed the funding, saying that the generosity of this federal grant will allow Currumbin Wildlife Hospital to expand its veterinary services to cope with the rapidly growing number of koala admissions. He went on to say, 'Currumbin Wildlife Hospital will also participate in crucial koala research projects looking to unlock the cures and identify the prevention options for many of the Koala diseases that are threatening the species.' This is important, groundbreaking work that the Morrison government is delivering in partnership with experts, the people on the ground each and every day working hard to support our koala populations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week we announced an $18 million package to protect koalas with $2 million going towards a national audit of koala populations, looking at where koalas are, where the habitat areas are and can be expanded, and establishing an annual monitoring program. We all want to see koalas prosper, but we can't do that until we know where they are and the best ways to help. The scientists are telling us that there's a serious lack of data about where these populations are, how they are faring and the best ways to help them recover. This census will create a picture that we just don't have at present. The big picture will help us understand the important local places for our koala population. Another $2 million will be invested in koala health research and veterinary support; and $14 million will help restore impacted koala habitats in both bushfire and non-bushfire affected areas and provide targeted funding for koala habitat in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2014 the government has invested $26 million into projects that have benefited koalas directly and indirectly. When it comes to looking after our iconic Australian species of koala, we won't be taking lessons from those opposite because it is this side of the chamber that has the record on delivering for koalas and continues to do so; they don't.</span>

I've never heard so much rubbish from the other side before. This environment minister has been invited to my electorate many times to see our wonderful koala population. It's been studied and studied and studied, and I make mention of the work of Professor Robert Close from the University of Western Sydney who's done some wonderful population work, tracking our koalas, checking their health. We have one of the only chlamydia-free koala populations in urban New South Wales. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we speak, koala habitat is being bulldozed. I've invited the federal environment minister many times to my electorate to see what's happening. She's refused every time. She is the environment minister like Nero: fiddling while Rome burns. She's watching the destruction of our iconic Australian wildlife, the koala in particular, and doing nothing about it. This government is doing nothing about it, allowing developers to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in development payments for their land while destroying our iconic koala population. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Habitat loss is amongst the most significant threats to our koalas, and the constituents in my electorate are crying out for action on the dire land clearing that's been allowed to occur under the watch of this government. It is an absolute tragedy that's evolving before our eyes. This government and this Clayton's environment minister are doing absolutely nothing about it. It is an evolving tragedy. On numerous occasions I've invited the federal Minister for the Environment to come and see our koala populations. More recently I invited the state environment minister, Matt Kean, to come and see our koala population. He came and was amazed by what we have in Macarthur. It should be a national park. As we watch, bulldozers are clearing koala habitats. It's a shame and it's a shame on this government that they're doing nothing about it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not to my surprise, this environment minister has refused to act and to even visit our electorate. The government is currently six years overdue in making a threatened species recovery plan for the koala. Yet this government is kicking the can down the road, saying they're going to have a census. I can show you: our koalas have had multiple censuses over many years by Professor Robert Close. All the information's here: the koalas have been tracked, named, checked for health; their breeding's been checked; and the genetics are all known. This is what's happening in my electorate, yet this environment minister, this government, just wants to kick the can down the road. It is just shameful that they would do this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen on so many occasions our really unique koala habitat destroyed for development. We're really frightened that the remaining koala habitat in my electorate could be the subject of bushfires this coming bushfire season, and nothing has been done to protect it. Labor has long called on the federal government to immediately work with the states and with each electorate, on an electorate-by-electorate basis, to save our koalas. We have schools in my electorate where the students are distracted by watching the koalas through the windows of their classroom; yet the government want to see that destroyed. When I say 'want to see that destroyed', it is quite clear what their policy is doing. They're kicking the can down the road so their developer mates can continue with development and habitat destruction until there is nothing left. They should be ashamed of themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I have come into this parliament, I have written to every environment minister requesting urgent action, but nothing has happened. Yet we hear again from this minister, 'We'll just kick the can down the road and we'll ignore them.' Labor has, of course, called for comprehensive ecological audits. In my electorate of Macarthur, in south-western Sydney, we know the koalas—we know their names, we know their habits, we know their breeding patterns and we know how they track. They go between the Georges River and Nepean River. We know what is happening and we are watching their habitat being destroyed as we speak. It is a huge shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this motion to the parliament and I call on the government to act. If they don't act soon, there will be nothing to act for. The only koalas left will be, as the previous member said, chocolate koalas that you can buy in a confectionary shop, and you won't be able to see them in the wild. This is an absolute tragedy that is evolving in front of our eyes, but this government does nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  Koalas are synonymous with the township of Port Macquarie in my electorate. When you drive into Port Macquarie and exit off at the Pacific Highway, at the service station there you will see Oceania, Mr T, Koala Z and Kirralee—four individually painted koala sculptures standing at a metre high. And if you enter from the north end, you won't drive far before you see another one-metre tall koala sculpture named Douglas. Hello Koalas is an award-winning tourism conservation initiative coordinated by Margaret Meagher. It has been in operation since 2014, and there are now about 77 koalas in the Hello Koala sculpture trail. One of the latest is Frankie the Firefighter, a koala dressed in the proud yellow and red uniform of the Rural Fire Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Port Macquarie, we also have the Koala Hospital, which rates as the No. 1 reason on tourism app Trip Advisor to visit the town. The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital has been outstanding in its actions to assist koalas from across New South Wales since its inception in 1973. During and after the Black Summer bushfires it raised about $8 million through its gofundme page and constructed and distributed 140 water drinking stations in koala habitat areas. The Koala Hospital is run by four paid staff and 140 passionate local volunteers. In fact, there is a waiting list to become a volunteer at the hospital. The hospital consists of one treatment room, eight intensive care units, six outdoor intensive care units and 33 rehabilitation yards, many with trees. But it is not only a hospital to treat sick and injured koalas; it is an organisation that assists with koala research, by partnering with the University of Sydney and the Queensland University of Technology. About 250 koalas are admitted through the hospital annually, and they come from all over New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hospital is about to embark on a world-first facility, delivered through its GoFundMe page and the state government's generous gifting of the land along with a further $5 million state grant. I am told that the new wild koala breeding facility will not only increase the number of koalas but also dramatically increase their chance of survival when released into the wild, due to extensive research. Port Macquarie Koala Hospital Director Cheyne Flanagan says that it will be a partnership project with universities and other research bodies as well. I know Ms Flanagan supports the member for Griffith's motion today to consider up-listing the koala status of 'vulnerable' under national environment laws. I also know the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who visited my electorate on 13 January, following the bushfires, also supports its consideration. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee is currently assessing all available information and will be undertaking a full assessment of the combined koala populations of Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. This assessment will consider the impacts of the devastating summer bushfires on koalas, as well as threats such as chlamydia and other diseases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the potential up-listing of the koala's status, the Morrison-McCormack government is acting. Indeed, the coalition government, since 2014, has invested over $26.4 million on projects supporting outcomes for koalas. Projects have included tree planting, propagating food trees and reconnecting corridors. Under the Environment Restoration Fund, a total of $6 million has been allocated for koalas, including $3 million for koala hospitals in South-East Queensland. The remaining $3 million from the Environment Restoration Fund is for projects that will improve and protect important koala habitat in New South Wales and South-East Queensland. But we must ensure our investment in the restoration and enhancement of koala habitat is targeted and backed by science. This is why, on 23 November, the environment minister announced our government will be providing $2 million for a national koala census. The environment minister knows many states and territory agencies, researchers, community groups and volunteers are collecting good information about koalas in the wild, but there are gaps and there is a need for coordination and reporting. I look forward to working with the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, its volunteers and other residents and encourage them to become involved in the census.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I thank the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Griffith, for bringing this motion forward for our debate. It's a critical topic at a critical time. The country is again in the grip of a heatwave, which of course freshens the still raw memory of last summer's awful devastation. It was our first national climate change disaster. It included the largest single fire ever recorded, 12 million hectares scorched, three billion animals dead, including many koalas, and a number of species and ecosystems pushed closer to the brink. Since that time, we've had the interim report of the EPBC review from Graeme Samuel, who said, quite plainly, that Australia's environment has been seriously degraded, that our environmental protection framework is not effective and that the present trajectory is of further decline. So, we have to ask: When exactly is the government going to start acknowledging the environmental reality and its responsibility to do something about it? When is a seven-year-old, three-term government going to take responsibility for presiding over the serious mismanagement and neglect of one of its core tasks, and that is national-level environmental protection and biodiversity conservation? How can it be that there isn't a threatened species recovery plan for an iconic species like the koala, when it was due in 2013? The only possible excuse, if you can call it an excuse, is that the koala is not alone in being neglected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, 170 out of 171 threatened species recovery plans are overdue. If it's too much to ask that the government do their job when it comes to environmental protection, they could try to stop actively making it worse: stop cutting resources to the environment department; stop weakening our environmental protection framework; stop ignoring the reality of climate change; and stop undermining the efforts of Australia's scientists and conservation sector. It could be made even simpler than that. The Minister for the Environment should see their chief responsibility as standing up and speaking up for the environment all day, every day, and that hasn't been the case. Instead, the various ministers for the environment in this government, because there have been four of them in the last five years, have consistently made it their priority to slash green tape. In other words, despite being ministers whose job it is to protect our environment and biodiversity, they have focused their attention on weakening regulation and in always seeking to accommodate economic interests at the expense of our wildlife, our landscapes and our marine environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that Australia's biodiversity is under enormous pressure and it has already suffered significant harm. We are, sadly, a world leader when it comes to mammal extinctions, and now the koala, as a species, is drifting from its present vulnerable status towards a situation where its survival may not be just threatened but it may be endangered. Of course the greatest danger to the koala comes from the destruction of their habitat, the destruction of the trees in which they live—the 50 different species of eucalypts, out of 700 species in total, that provide the kilo or so of leaves that koalas eat each day. Yet, despite the clarity we have in relation to the chief vectors of harm and risk, we also have a minister who is looking to make the environment become second best at every turn, never minding that in present circumstances, as Australia's wildlife battles against deforestation, invasive species and climate change, second best will inevitably deliver more extinctions and more irreversible environmental harm. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's for all these reasons that Labor, through the shadow minister for the environment, have called for a full ecological audit in the aftermath of the bushfires—not just a koala census but a full ecological audit. We've called on the government to reverse its cuts to the department and to scientific organisations like the CSIRO, and we've fought against the government's effort to ram through legislation that would undermine the EPBC at a time when it desperately needs to be improved in accordance with Graeme Samuel's advice. It requires significantly improved and in some cases uncompromising national standards, and it requires an independent and properly resourced tough environmental watchdog and oversight agency. The fact that the government has ruled out such a watchdog before the final report has even landed tells you everything you need to know about this government's lack of commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I take this opportunity at the end of what has been a very difficult year and at the beginning of another challenging summer to acknowledge the incredible work and effort of the people around Australia engaged in our great shared cause of looking after our remarkable and distinctive environment. I say to all Indigenous rangers and traditional owners, to the fire response volunteers, to people in rural and regional Australia working on revegetation and salinity remediation projects, to those who support local animal rescue centres and hospitals, to those who work in the sustainable timber industry and fight to protect old-growth forests and to those who turn up to beach clean-ups and work to reduce the harm caused by marine plastics—to everyone who makes environmental conservation, restoration and activism a part of their lives, whether professionally or as a volunteer: thank you. You are all engaged in a vital effort. Keep going.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Certainly I can agree with the member for Griffith on this aspect of the motion: the importance of protecting our koala population and particularly our local koala population in the Ryan electorate. However, the statements made in the motion that this side of the House, the government, is not steadfastly committed to this task is simply not the case. Since 2014 the government has invested over $26.4 million on projects for the support, the protection and the growth of our local koala population—projects like tree planting and reconnecting vital koala corridors and preserving our important koala habitat. This month we have announced an $18 million package to protect Australia's koalas, including a national koala audit that will help scientists better understand the locations and the movements of our local koalas and enable us to better determine how best to support their continued growth as a population. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know in particular that my good friend in the neighbouring electorate, the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, the member for Brisbane, is very passionate about this particular issue. He knows, as I do, how important the local koala population is, particularly to our home city of Brisbane. Throughout my time as a local councillor and now in this place I've been proud to support koala facilities, particularly those in our electorate of Ryan. It's ironic that it's the member for Griffith who has moved this particular motion, when her electorate is in the city of Brisbane where the local council invests more in protecting koala habitat and supporting the koala population than any other local government around Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ryan electorate itself is home to two fantastic koala facilities. I want to take the opportunity of this particular motion to highlight them because their volunteers and staff are out there on the ground every day helping to protect our koala population. The first is Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the world's first and largest koala sanctuary, right in our electorate of Ryan at Fig Tree Pocket. It's home to 130 koalas, which is a decent sized population in itself. It is a fantastic tourist attraction of course, but Lone Pine as a koala sanctuary serves a very important purpose of helping to do further research on koalas and helping to rehabilitate injured and sick koalas as well. Through its efforts with tourists, it is of course continuing to preserve our Aussie icon by ensuring that the world knows how precious the koala population is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 has proven itself to be tough, and this year has proven to be tough for all of us. But it has proven to be tough for our zoos and aquariums. Through the federal government's $94.6 million support package, Lone Pine was able to continue to care for its animals. Robert, the then general manager of Lone Pine, described it in these terms: 'Even though tourists weren't able to visit the sanctuary during the lockdown, it's important to remember vet bills, food costs and other maintenance for the animals did not stop. The government's support was essential in ensuring the ongoing costs could be met.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lone Pine is also home to the Brisbane Koala Science Institute. This was an election commitment of mine in 2016 when I was a local councillor. The Brisbane City Council put $3 million towards establishing it. It is a fantastic addition to Lone Pine's sanctuary efforts. The Koala Science Institute brings together koala scientists and environmentalists from around the nation, along with the universities and our next generation of scientists, to further their research in a collaborative manner and to further the cause of our local koala population. Their current research focuses on trying to understand why some koalas developed severe disease when they are infected with chlamydia, which is a threat, of course, to our declining northern wild koala population, including the role that genetics can play. They are looking at the way that they can sequence those genetics. The facilities at Lone Pine will allow other researchers to analyse samples from koala populations right across South-East Queensland. The work being done at Lone Pine is helping to pioneer Australia's conservation efforts in this related field and will play a crucial role in protecting the koala species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our electorate of Ryan is also home to the Moggill Koala Rehabilitation Centre, which was opened in 1991 to provide care for injured, sick or orphaned koalas. The Moggill koala centre is part of a greater network of wildlife facilities in South-East Queensland serving our injured koala population. Just like these two great Ryan institutions, this government will be focused on practical measures to protect our koala population—not the virtue signalling of the opposition but practical, on-the-ground measures and funding, where we can, to help our koala populations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  It isn't unusual for constituents in my electorate to post photos and video on Facebook of koalas in trees in their backyards. This is not something we go to a zoo or a facility to see, because we live in World Heritage, and it's World Heritage that creates the habitat for these koalas to not just pass through but to breed and establish themselves in. The bushfires, which went through 80 per cent of the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage area, took a terrible toll on the koala populations that we had. Vast numbers were killed in last summer's bushfire crisis. It's estimated that around one-third of the koala population across New South Wales died. Nationally, the figure was 30,000. Locally, it has been devastating for those who care for koalas through WIRES and volunteer organisations and also for our NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, who now go through bush not seeing the things they had seen for so many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that troubles me is that we have had so little trickle-down of promised bushfire funding to try to support the existing koala populations or even get in early and find them. Volunteers did so much, just as they did during the fires. They organised parties to go in and rescue as many koalas as they could. What we're seeing is an incredibly endangered species. It is time for this government to get serious about what it's going to do to ensure these populations come back and then thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first really comprehensive scientific study that has been done of the New South Wales koala population post the bushfires, which was done mainly on the North Coast, they found 70 per cent of the population had been killed. That's the sort of scale we're talking about. In my own area—in particular, in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury—Science for Wildlife's executive director Kellie Leigh organised an incredible rescue operation when the bushfires began to take over at this time last year. These were koalas that had been fitted with radio collars. Authorities gave her team just two days to get in and try and save as many koalas as they could, because they thought that, if it all burnt, at least there'd be some good genes that had been rescued. Her volunteers searched through smoke and scorched earth. One person scaled a 130-foot tall eucalyptus tree to retrieve animals. They saved 10 adults and two juveniles. A koala named Houdini had to be left behind because there was just no time to extract him from a deep ravine. These were really difficult things to do. In the fires that burned through this area, Kellie thinks that around 1,000 koalas died.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge we have is to try to bring all this back, and the lands that border national park are so important for this. One of the challenges is that there is pressure in relation to development for those areas. Two incredible WIRES volunteers, Morgan and John, have cared for 10 or 11 koalas just since September. They say they've just been smashed this season, because, while there is growth happening, if there aren't enough trees and fresh leaves for these very fussy koalas to make a meal of, we're going to lose them. Everyone knows that the biggest threat in our area is the destruction of habitat as the result of urban development. Kurrajong Hills is a real epicentre for koalas. Just recently an 800-acre farm has been subdivided into 10-acre lots. The EIS for this was done in 2007. It was done 13 years ago. The EIS said it was a poor habitat area for koalas. We all know that that is absolute garbage. It is really ideal country for koalas, particularly when the World Heritage area has been so devastated by fires. So there is a need for this government to take it seriously. Dr Kellie Leigh is surveying people and asking, 'How much do you want to save koalas?' I'm going to put a link to her survey on my website and my Facebook page so that we can do something, even if this government won't.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) congratulates Scouts Australia, Girl Guides Australia and the World Organization of the Scout Movement for continuing to provide an outlet for children to channel their desire for adventure, education and fun, and for providing ongoing assistance around our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are certain qualities that many people aspire to which are highly valued in our society: being respectful, friendly and considerate; caring for others and the environment and using resources wisely; doing what is right and being trustworthy, honest and fair; doing your best; believing in yourself; learning from experiences; and facing challenges with courage. As a business owner and employer, these are the sorts of qualities I look for when I'm hiring a new employee or selecting someone for promotion. These important qualities are the values that are taught by Scouts and Girl Guides groups in my electorate of Longman and right across Australia. For more than 100 years the Scouts and Girl Guides have been helping to build and develop the confidence of young people, not just here in Australia but in many countries around the world. Children and young adults aged from five to 25 have been learning outdoor skills while developing a sense of adventure, teamwork, creativity and independence. The personal development programs of the Scouts and Girl Guides have been an important opportunity for young people in communities right across the country to develop the skills that put them on the path to future success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Businessman Dick Smith, Formula One legend Sir Jack Brabham and celebrities like Shane Jacobson and Bert Newton were all once Scouts. Wildlife ambassador and TV personality Robert Irwin is a Scouts Queensland ambassador. Former Liberal Party leader Brendan Nelson was in the Scouts. Around the world, other famous Scouts include Billy Connolly, Bill Gates, Sir Paul McCartney, David Beckham, Venus Williams and Bear Grylls. The Scouts and Girl Guides are still amongst the most popular programs worldwide for personal development in young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Longman we are very blessed with six different Scout groups, in Woodford, Caboolture, Morayfield, Burpengary, Narangba and Bribie Island. Thousands of people have been through the doors of these groups over the years, and there are currently about 350 youth members across these six groups. They continue to do a great job working with young people in my electorate and providing them with the skills and values that will help put them on the pathway to success. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps surprising in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, scouting in my home state of Queensland has seen significant growth in membership figures since April. Membership in the Longman scouting groups has increased 22.7 per cent in the past eight months, and that trend continues to rise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the schools and other organisations ceased to meet face to face back in April, Scouts Queensland launched the Scouting@Home program. More than 400 online resources were created, which enabled the Scouts to continue weekly meetings and activities. In fact many of the resources created in Queensland were used in other states as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scouting theme for 2020, very appropriately, has been resilience. A recent survey conducted by Scouts Australia found that Scouts demonstrated a far wider range of resilient behaviours than their peers. Like many groups, they need volunteers to help out and there are a range of different roles available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local Scouts and Guides groups also need to raise funds so their members can enjoy the many activities and events these groups participate in. State scouting bodies have accessed government grants at different times, though most of their revenue comes from local fundraising activities, donations and membership fees. As you can imagine, COVID-19 restrictions have prevented many of these fundraising activities like the Bunnings sausage sizzles. Despite this, Scouts Australia is still going strong with around 70,000 members and it is part of a much larger global family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scouting movement around the world has around 40 million members. When the Scouts were first established in my home state of Queensland in 1908, the movement spread rapidly. It was soon apparent that many girls wanted to become Scouts too, and so the Girl Guides was formed the following year. There have been more than a million Girl Guides in Australia since that time. Globally, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has 10 million members from 150 different countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next year the Scouts in Australia will celebrate their 113th birthday, and the Girl Guides their 112th. Congratulations Scouts Australia, Girl Guides Australia and the World Organization of the Scout Movement for helping our kids learn the values and skills that ultimately make our communities a better place in which to live.</span>

                  <a href="E09" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  In academic circles and among business thinkers around the world at the moment, there's a real focus on how to develop a commercially viable business that delivers social good rather than a one-on-one transaction that does what it does and delivers a social good to the broader community. You can see it through exploration of social enterprise and impact investing, and even great academics like Michael Porter will say to you that something has to be commercially viable if it's going to scale. If you want something that will solve social good, you need to make it commercially viable in order for it to scale. Every time I hear that—and I am quite a fan of Michael Porter and a whole range of others, and I read a lot of academic research because it's really interesting—I think, 'Yeah, except for Surf Life Saving, Country Women's Association, amateur sport and Scouts'. There are many others: these organisations that form as a tiny little bud, scale around the world and 100 years or more later are still flourishing with more loyalty and commitment than you find in any commercial business and living longer than most commercial companies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Something very special happens when a good idea takes root in a community, and they pick it up as volunteers, and Scouts and Guides are no doubt that. Formed, as it was, by Lord Baden-Powell in 1907, was the world scouting movement. Parramatta picked it up in 1908. One year later the Parramatta Scout Group was established, one of the first in Australia—of course, because we're Parramatta; we do that—and it is still thriving. In fact now we have 12 Scout groups in the electorate of Parramatta, and I am going to name them—there are 1,000 members at least. They are the 1st/2nd Second Merrylands (St Anne's) Scout Group; the 1st/2nd Second Merrylands (St Anne's) Rover Crew; the 3rd Merrylands Scout Group; the 1st Westmead Scout Group; the 1st Westmead Rover Crew; the 1st Granville Scout Group; and the 1st Rydalmere Scout Group, which is reopening because the interest in scouting is growing again, largely because of COVID, and looking for outdoor activities and really safe places for children to be, and the Scouts organisation have worked so hard to make sure they're COVID-safe. You can absolutely guarantee that they will follow the rules that they set down, and you know your child will actually be doing the things they say they are going to do. Children are returning to Scouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the ones reopening. We have the 1st Parramatta Scout Group—that is, the really old one—the 1st Toongabbie Scout Group, the 1st Carlingford Scout Group, the Western Sydney Buddha's Light International Association Scout Group and the Kings Langley Rover Scout Unit Westmead, which is reopening for joeys and cubs right now, again, because the interest in scouting is growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a great bunch of people they are. I have spent quite a bit of time with my local Scouts, various groups of them. I've been there for all sorts of events and they are an amazing bunch of people. Five hundred Scouts attend the Dawn Service in Parramatta every year—500 of them! We have three or four RSLs, so we have a few dawn services in Parramatta; I can't get to them all. They tend to stagger them, so I can rush from one to the other in many cases. That 500 Scouts attend in Parramatta alone really is quite amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking back at the history of volunteers with Scouts, we have had volunteers like Annette Douglas, who has been a cub scout leader with Parramatta Scout Group since 1990 and an honorary leader since 2017. She's over 80 now and she is still there contributing actively and supporting young people in our community; what an extraordinary contribution she has made. This year Annette received an OAM in the Australia Day 2020 honours for her contribution to youth and Scouts—incredibly deserving. Sandy Knox has been with Ermington Scouts since 2004. She has served as a leader with joeys, cubs and venturers and has been instrumental in putting on major local events like the Parramatta district fun day and the annual New South Wales cuborees. Leonie Plumber has been part of Carlingford Scouts since 1992. She trained hundreds of joeys in this time while working with children in her own scout group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year I get invited to the Cumberland Gang Show, which is over 50 years old. In the last 16 years, I've been to it 14 times. It is an extraordinary organisation with an extraordinary bunch who keep that institution alive year after year after year. Every time someone tells you, 'If it's not commercially viable, it can't scale', think Scouts, an organisation of 100 years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SIMMONDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  It is a great pleasure to support the motion of my friend the member for Longman. It is a cracker motion because it gives us all the opportunity to talk about the valuable contribution that Guides and Scouts provide for our community. Particularly this year, when our young Australians needed the opportunity to continue to keep in touch with their friends, Scouts and Guides provided that opportunity. When you think about it, has their motto of 'be prepared' ever been more relevant than it has been this year in 2020? We all needed to be more prepared, and they are the kinds of things they are teaching scouts and guides—those leadership skills and opportunities for life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate in Ryan is home to eight fantastic scout groups—the Kenmore group, the Moggill group, the Barton group, the Enoggera Scout Group, the Indooroopilly group, Taringa Milton Toowong Group, Grovely Mitchelton and the St Johns Wood group at Ashgrove.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a very proud Scout at the Moggill Scout Group, where I learned some of those very  important skills all of our local kids, leaders and families learn. My dad was a community leader. Like so many other community leaders, I saw him work incredibly hard. Even long after I left that scouting group, he was there supporting local people. For a number of years after I left Scouts, I was the chairman for the Tyakunda district, supporting our uniformed volunteers in Scouts as well, which was a tremendous privilege.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't say I've had the same connection with the Girl Guides; I was never a Girl Guide. But we have five Girl Guide groups who do a fantastic job in our local electorate of Ryan. We have Girl Guides at Kenmore district, St Lucia district, Moggill district, Walton Bridge/The Gap district and Bardon district. I really want to pay tribute to Scout and Girl Guide groups in the Ryan electorate. They are essential local community groups that facilitate the personal progression of those young men and women. The youth program is concentrating, for the Scouts, particularly on leadership and teamwork in the categories of the outdoors, community involvement, creativity and personal growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They of course rely very heavily on fundraising and donations as well as membership fees. That has been very difficult in this year of COVID-19, but they have done tremendously well. The Taringa Milton Toowong Scout Group in particular have their annual mulch drive. Normally I am there with my shovel bagging up mulch myself, but that wasn't possible with COVID-19. It was a much smaller operation this year, but they still did get their normal mulch drive out in some way, shape or fashion. My wife, Maddy, and I were very pleased not only to be a keen purchaser of the mulch for the garden but also to support that fantastic scout group. Likewise, the Kenmore Scout Group are always out there supporting our local community. They were out there for Clean Up Australia Day on 1 March. Again, it has been hard for them to fundraise, but they've persevered and they recently finished up their fundraising raffle as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, we are also proud to support them as a government. One of the examples of where we're reaching out to support the scouts and the guides is St Johns Wood Scout Group through the government's Stronger Communities Program. I've been able to support them as a local MP to undertake some much-needed club refurbishments to their 45-year-old building. If you visit their clubhouse and see what the improvements look like, including a new roof, they have put the Stronger Communities Program grant to very good use and they've driven the money a long way. Not only has it given them a new roof and a building that is fit for purpose for their activities going forward; it will now allow them to put solar panels on the roof, to be installed in the near future, to make the building more environmentally friendly and improve their sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This group has provided, as all the groups have, a much-needed and important local connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the energy and initiative of the St Johns Wood Scout Group during COVID-19 has seen its membership grow and increase, from 88 in April 2019 to 134 today, because they were on Zoom and they were continuing to look out for and support each other. Their group leader, Alan Brake, said, 'Scouts volunteers have implemented additional sanitising to continue to deliver important training under a COVID-safe plan.' Many parents have expressed their appreciation for the pivotal stability that these scouting programs have provided during these difficult times. Scouts contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual potential as individuals. I congratulate all the volunteers, scouts and guides in the Ryan electorate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:37</span>):  I rewind the clock back to 1978, when I promised that I would do my best to do my duty to God, to serve the Queen, to help others and to keep the Brownie guide law—it sticks in my memory—as I made my Brownie Girl Guides salute. In those days, as Brownies we wore the brown tunic with the leather belt. We even wore brown undies, Deputy Speaker. What fantastic times we had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a kid that was born with much older siblings, I was on my own a fair bit, so mum sent me along to Brownies. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I went on to be a Girl Guide and, again, truly loved those experiences. Whether it was doing badges—I can still tie a reef knot, a bowline, half-hitches and a few other things, which keeps me reasonably handy around the farm from time to time and on the occasional boat—or other activities, I think about those things that we learnt in Brownies and Guides over the years. Things like reflecting on that promise, a duty, a sense of community service, whether it was going to help out in the community or whether it was going on pack holidays and learning to get along with other people and just being good members of a group. It was such an important and informative time for all of us learning together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that I really think back on it as a member of parliament, I didn't quite realise how much of our First Nations culture we embraced as Girl Guides and Brownies. I think back to some of my pack leaders and I think of brown owl Elizabeth Masterman, who still lives in Pelaw Main not very far from me. Even when I go to Coles and do the shopping I still refer to her as Brown Owl, and she says, 'Meryl, you should call me Elizabeth', and I say, 'You will always be Brown Owl to me.' It's just one of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brownies, Guides, Scouts and Venturers give kids a sense of belonging, a sense of duty and a sense of respect. These are all values which we all need. As we're growing up—it doesn't matter whether you're religious, not religious, Liberal, Labor, Nats, Callithumpian or Independent—we all need to learn those core beliefs that make us good citizens. We might embellish those values as we get older, with different beliefs of how we should get to that common goal but, at the end of the day, we want to be good citizens, we want to contribute and we want to have a sense of duty to our community and ourselves. I honestly believe that Girl Guiding and Scouting give young children that. So even if your child may not be particularly sporty or musical but you want them to be involved in a group that will give them good practical skills and that will allow them to reach into experiences that they wouldn't have thought they would experience in a million years, Scouting and Girl Guiding do a fantastic job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouts Australia has over 17,000 youth and adult members, and Guides have over 30,000 members. Young people thrive from the life skills and socialisation that these groups provide. Again, friendships that we made as Brownies and Guides and that I know that young people make today will stand you in good stead over the years—and you just never know when you will bump into someone again or retain those friendships. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to send a shout-out to my Scouts groups. The Port Stephens Scouts have Tilligerry, Nelson Bay, Anna Bay, Raymond Terrace and East Maitland—a great group of scouts. I was fortunate enough to visit East Maitland Scouts a little bit over 12 months ago. I had a fantastic night at East Maitland Scouts, talking to young people and participating in their activities. We even did a bit of cooking. It was really great. Kurri Kurri Scouts is just down the hill from where our Guide hall is in Kurri Kurri. I'd like to throw out a special mention to the Guide hall in Kurri Kurri. A really severe storm went through Kurri a few years ago, and the after-hours ambulance hall that was used for OOSH lost its roof. The Guides gave its hall for OOSH to use. That's community spirit. So keep Guiding, keep going to Scouts and keep making a contribution. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282984" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONNELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>) (17<span class="HPS-Time">:42</span>):  I'm so pleased to be surrounded by passionate community advocates—no less than the member for Paterson, an ex-Brownie, and the member for Ryan, an ex-Boy Scout. I wasn't a Boy Scout but my father was. His pioneering ways and the camps that he used to take me on, with his billy, his swag and his Scout songs, certainly inspired me. I did become an Army cadet—something a bit similar and certainly akin to fostering a spirit of adventurism and resilience. I think we can all agree that if there are a couple of things that we want in our children, adventurism and resilience have to be right up there at the top of the list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I appreciate this opportunity to give a shout-out to Scouts Australia and Girl Guides Australia. Scouts Australia is 70,000 strong. It's part of a 40-million-member worldwide organisation of the Scouts movement. This provides boys and girls aged five to 25 with fun and challenging opportunities to grow through adventure. Scouts Australia is also one of the largest youth development organisations in the whole country. Across the country, there are thousands of volunteer branch and section commissioners, leaders and supporters. Girl Guides Australia is the peak body for guiding in Australia, and is a not-for-profit organisation. It offers girls aged five to 17 years a unique girl-led experience in a safe, welcoming space with a variety of activities. The world association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has 10 million Girl Guides and Scouts from across 150 organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a normal year the bulk of funds moving into the Scouts and Guides come from fundraising, but in 2020 there have been some pretty big impacts on the ability to fundraise through things like the cookie drive and car washes, which I know some of my local Scouts get into. All of these have been impacted by COVID. But also local, state and federal government funding forms a component of how we get behind and support Scouts. I was delighted, in my own electorate of Stirling, to award $5,000 in this past financial year to the Tuart Hill Yokine Scout Group under the Volunteer Grants program. I was also delighted, last November, to have joined the Tuart Hill Yokine Scout Group for its 70th birthday celebration. It was a wonderful occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouts Australia has also received JobKeeper this year, which has assisted with cash flow during what has been a very difficult financial year. Less obvious, but quite unfortunate, has been the restrictions on movement, which, as I mentioned, have impacted that fundraising. That's where it's been great to see again the resilience displayed by these organisations. We all know that facing adversity is par for the course for Scouts and Guides and they will emerge strongly in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also seen Scouts WA continue to provide their services and camps throughout 2020. That's provided a wonderful sense of normality for a lot of those kids who have been able to keep being involved in Scouts. Also, Scouts WA has completed its new program, which successfully aims to be adventurous, fun, challenging and inclusive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we come towards the end of the year, I thank and congratulate all of the group leaders and section leaders in WA, and particularly of those in the scout groups in Stirling, at Amelia Heights, Dianella, Hamersley, Karrinyup, Tuart Hill Yokine, Scarborough Beach and North Beach, for instance. I also congratulate Ayden Mackenzie, who in July was invested as the Chief Commissioner of Scouts in WA. He is the youngest ever chief commissioner. I'm told he has a bold vision for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person who has gone from strength to strength with the help of Scouts is Caitlin Arcus. Caitlin led Scouts during the COVID-19 pandemic as acting chief commissioner. Two years ago, aged just 26, Caitlin was appointed the youngest ever deputy chief commissioner of Scouts WA. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I also recognise my good friend Warren Mickelson and his son Connor. I've watched Warren and Connor operate in Scouts. Warren has also been really passionate in his leadership within the Scouts. This sort of passion supports the kids to have the adventure and excitement that is so important for every child's development. To Ayden, Caitlin, Warren and so many others like them across the country: thank you for what you're doing. You are shining examples to our kids, helping to build that spirit of adventure and resilience.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (17<span class="HPS-Time">:47</span>):  As a former cub scout and Army cadet for a short time––the Scouts have been around for more than 100 years. The movement was first founded in the UK in 1907 by Lord Baden-Powell. Since then scouting has evolved into a worldwide movement of nearly 50 million young people and adult volunteers, and is welcoming to all genders. I must give a shout-out to my late mother. She was Baloo in my scout group. She did her bit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouting provides young people, guided by adult volunteers, the opportunity to participate in programs, events, activities and projects that contribute to their growth as active citizens. As the member for Paterson pointed out, that's what it is about: it grows young kids into being really good citizens. Today Scouts Australia is a 70,000-strong organisation. It is part of the 40-million-member world organisation of the scout movement. Scouts Australia has a vision that by 2023 Scouts will be the leading youth development movement in Australia, empowering 83,000 young people to be resilient, self-fulfilled, positive change-makers in their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouting first appeared in Tasmania in 1909, just two years after Lord Baden-Powell. We're first at everything! Within a year of the publication in Britain of Baden-Powell's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scouting for boys</span>––it has been around for a long time––small groups of boys in Hobart, Devonport and Wynyard, each supported by an enthusiastic adult, undertook challenging activities like ambulance work and camp craft. When Baden-Powell first visited Tasmania in 1912, similar groups of scouts were functioning in other towns. For the next 50 years, senior British Scouting personnel came to the state to share ideas, offer advice and provide expert training for leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the early years, the movement in Tasmania received a modest annual grant from the state government. I'm not sure that they still do; I'm sure they'd welcome it. This was supplemented by income from the Scout Shop and a waste materials collection service, while groups raised money from fairs, dances and Euchre tournaments—a card game. By the mid-1920s, there were some 1,000 Scouts of all ranks in the state. Parent support groups began to appear and the movement enjoyed a lot of support from business, political and civic leaders. In December '33, the organisation was confident enough to stage one of the first national scouting youth events held in the state: a Scout corroboree at Lake Sorell, near my home town.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of Scouting in Tasmania has always fluctuated. It reached a peak of about 5,000 in the early 1970s, but it's still going strong. It's quiet but strong. Early this month, the Joey Scouts celebrated 30 years in Tasmania, with birthday events at the botanical gardens in Hobart and Hollybank in Launceston. There were games, bushwalking and, of course, birthday cake. Scouts Tasmania held its annual Scout camping competition this month, the statewide Clark Trophy, with 110 scouts and 55 leaders converging on Fulton Park to enjoy a weekend of fine weather and camping. A couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend—with Senator Anne Urquhart, a Tasmanian—the Tasmanian Scouts AGM, with President Corey McGrath; Chief Commissioner Michael Hovington; and Chief Scout of Tasmania Kate Warner AC, our state's wonderful Governor. It was a joy to watch this community come together from all around the state and descend on Bridgewater, in the south of my electorate, after what has been a very challenging year, for a number of reasons, and celebrate their achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to acknowledge life-member inductees Maria Direen and Susan Hovington, and years of service awardees Marion Blight, for 30 years of service, and Denice Walters, for 35 years of service to the organisation. Seeing them take to the podium with great pride after a lifetime of service was really something to see. Also, well done to Australian Scout Medallion awardees Evan Eastman-Peck and Yumani Nevah, who are the next generation of young Scouts coming through; already they're leaders. The Australian Scout Medallion is the highest award in the Scout section and is achieved by only the top five per cent of Scouts in Australia, so it's a particularly great achievement by these young people. I take this opportunity to congratulate Scouts Australia, Girl Guides Australia, and the world organisation of the Scout movement for continuing to provide an outlet for children to channel their desire for adventure, education and fun and for providing ongoing assistance around our communities. Dib, dib, dib; dob, dob, dob!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  I want to start by apologising to the House for not being appropriately dressed. I haven't got my scarf on to talk about a very important issue today. I am a bit upset, but I'm sure the member for Lyons also regrets not having his scarf on. Local community groups and associations are the foundation of our society. As members of parliament, we regularly have the opportunity and privilege to be invited to be members of these groups or visit them to see what they do and how they do it. Such groups are the Scouts and Girl Guides. Just over a week ago, I had the honour to be invited to the Kirwan Scout Group to be, as they call it, 'scarfed up'. This was my first experience at a Scout meeting. After being greeted by my host, I was escorted to a parade to see 30 or so young men and women standing proudly at attention around a campfire and their flag pole. The parade was led by one of their peers who called on various leaders to address the meeting and keep everyone up-to-date on what was going on. Soon it was my turn to be called upon to be 'scarfed up'. I was humbled to receive this honour on behalf of the community I serve. I was welcomed into the Kirwan Scout family and issued an open invitation to attend any of their meetings and activities in the future, which is something I'm very grateful for and looking forward to. I was also presented with a scout name. I have a call sign: it's 'Goanna'. I'm pretty happy and excited about the call sign I've been given. As we know, it's a very prominent animal in the north, so I was very happy. I told my wife, and she thought it was hilarious. She thought I should have been named 'Koala Bear'!</span>
              </p>

                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  I would have thought 'Wombat'!</span>

                  </a>  The wombat was already taken! Despite her being upset, I think Goanna is a good name, and I now have my two-year-old daughter calling me Goanna. But there was one more job to do, and that was, as the newest member of this community, to add a log into the fire. The ashes from this log would be used next week, the week after and into the future and years to come in a tradition that symbolises the community of the group being a part of something that is bigger than any individual or person or group of people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to thank the Kirwan Scout Group for welcoming me into their hearts. I was struck by their sense of service and their sense of community. These young men and women and their parents were a part of this movement to grow and develop not only their own skills and character but those of their scouting mates and to help others in the community. One of those lessons was being taught within minutes after being scarfed up. It was a very important ability—to cook a pizza over a fire. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouts and Girl Guides are critical for our local communities because they encourage young men and women to seek out adventure and to pursue their own dreams. They give them an opportunity to develop life skills and drive their sense of curiosity in a safe and rewarding environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the leaders of the Kirwan group is a senior local police sergeant. He's someone who has an extremely busy and important job, but he's an example of the kind of person who donates their spare time and energy to ensure their students have opportunities. He knows that the more kids he mentors the better his community will be in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm very happy to speak in support of this motion today. Scouts and Girl Guides across Australia have a membership of over 70,000. Worldwide, this number exceeds 40 million. I know that this year has been a difficult one for Scouts and Girl Guides, as it has been for so many other community groups. One of the things affected by COVID-19 are the regular fundraisers, including the famous cookie drives, so there has been a loss of regular income to keep all of their important programs running. But as restrictions ease and we start to get back to normality I'd like to see more fundraisers from these groups continuing to thrive and be able to go down to the local Bunnings, pick up a sausage and raise money for these groups, because they're so important for our future generations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I want to give a big shout-out to our Scouts and Guides groups on the New South Wales South Coast. Wherever I go I'm always thrilled and amazed to see Scouts and Guides out playing their part in the community—helping people in our community, giving back to others and importantly learning lifelong skills and making lifelong friends. These young people are our future, and the skills and experience they obtain with the Scouts and Guides will no doubt stay with them for life. I want to thank the many leaders who take the time to lead Scouts and Guides in my local community. It is a time-consuming role, but it is one that I can clearly see provides so much enjoyment for leaders in helping guide our young people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A while ago I attended a local Remembrance Day service at St Georges Basin RSL subbranch. Afterwards we went to the Scout hall and had morning tea. I was delighted to see the 1st St Georges Basin Scout Group and their families out in action, providing tea, coffee and slices, but also, more importantly, bridging the gap between our veterans and learning from them. These activities might seem simple, but they are so important in today's world. Well done to all the Scouts who were involved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasure of delivering a new flag to the North Nowra Girl Guides. Apart from delivering the flag I got an insight into the extremely busy and well-coordinated junior programs that they're running. The Guides welcomed me with open arms, and I was delighted to join with them. What struck me was the passion the guides showed with their carefully thought out activities, including groovy scientific experiments, spinning wheels and much more. Thanks for having me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I attended the Illawarra Rose Festival, held in Jamberoo, I was taken with the 1st Jamberoo Scout Group. They were diligently providing the hospitality—preparing morning and afternoon tea, expertly taking orders and delivering the tea and food with a smile. These young scouts were learning valuable skills, all under the watchful eye of their leaders. Well done to them all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go to my local Relay For Life events, I always see our local Scouts groups out there, raising awareness about cancer prevention, fundraising to support cancer patients, providing support and, importantly, having a lot of fun dressing up, participating in fun events and walking laps through the night. They of course have their tents, and they are pretty good campers. It's all for a good cause, and it's fabulous to see young kids getting so involved from such a young age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales South Coast was hit hard during the bushfires, but our local Scouts and Girl Guides groups rose to the challenge of supporting their community. The 1st Batemans Bay Scout Group were very busy with their fire-recovery community service projects, including making wildlife feeding boxes and collecting donations. They were making new signs for the Australian Rainbow Vets and Allies Mardi Gras market day, as they lost all their decorations and signs in the recent fires. Then, on Australia Day this year, the inaugural 1st Batemans Bay Scout Group versus Emergency Services Australia Day Tug of War Challenge was held, and a great day was had by all. It's an important event which really highlights the community coming together and the importance of groups like Scouts and our emergency services working together—so special, and another amazing example of how our community has pulled together through these tough times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the sort of passion we should be proud of, and I say a huge thank you to all our Scouts and Guides and their leaders for all they do. I want to recognise those groups today. It's a bit of a long list. The Scouts groups are: 1st St Georges Basin Scout Group, 1st Nowra Scout Group, 1st Bomaderry Scout Group, 1st Kangaroo Valley Scout Group, 1st Burrill-Ulladulla Scout Group, 1st Illaroo Scout Group, Shoalhaven Rover Crew, 1st Jamberoo Scout Group, 1st Kiama Scout Group, 1st Batemans Bay Scout Group and 1st Moruya Scout Group. The Girl Guides groups are: Huskisson Bay Guides, Huskisson Bay Ranger Guides, Huskisson Gumnut Guides, Huskisson Junior Guides, Kiama Flametree Guides, Kiama Seashells Junior Guides, North Nowra Guides, North Nowra Junior Guides, North Nowra Pre Junior Guides, Nowra Guides, Nowra Junior Guides, Sussex Inlet Black Swan Guides and Moruya Swan Girl Guides.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I want to thank the member for Longman for his motion, and I would also like to note my appreciation and support for Scouts and Girl Guides associations across Australia but particularly within my electorate of Boothby. These wonderful groups provide young girls and boys and young men and women with a range of life skills while they participate in supporting their local communities as active volunteers. We know the past year has had a big impact on Scouts and Girl Guides activities, as restrictions imposed on community groups have prevented many of the typical activities they would usually undertake—like fundraising, for example, and helping out in our local communities—but they have managed to continue a lot of the activities by getting creative through online meetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Boothby our Scouts groups include: 2nd Adelaide Scout Group, based in Mitcham, Ascot Park Scout Group, Belair Scout Group, Black Forest Scout Group, Blackwood Scout Group, Darlington Scout Group, Eden Hills Scout Group, Hawthorn Scout Group and Somerton Park Sea Scout Group. Along with our Girl Guides groups, Belair Girl Guides, Colonel Light Gardens Girl Guides and Dover Girl Guides. I have had a wonderful relationship with my scouts and guides over the years, as their federal MP, visiting them during their meetings, attending significant anniversaries to help them celebrate and helping them to secure funding for important upgrades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, for example, I was very fortunate to attend the 110th birthday of the 2nd Adelaide Scout Group in Mitcham which I'm proud to note is the oldest continuously operating Scout group in South Australia. The celebrations were attended by the Chief Commissioner of Scouts SA, Harry Long; Scout group leader Natalie Steward, who celebrated 10 years in the role; committee chairman Andrew Hill; Scout leader David Lawlor; and the MC for the day and local scouting legend Alex Brown, who spoke beautifully about the confidence and skills scouting provides to young people. A large number of current and former Scouts and special guests also helped us to celebrate this wonderful milestone. The occasion was marked with a presentation of artefacts for storage in a brand-new time capsule as well as some wonderful singing led by the Joey Scouts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over my time in parliament I have also spent a lot of time with the Belair Girl Guides. Their leader, Jan Childs, is one of our most dedicated community volunteers and she has worked tirelessly to empower and teach young girls and young women a range of skills and what it is to be a true community volunteer. Jan had been working for many, many years to secure funding to upgrade their kitchen, which was originally built in the 1950s. I was delighted to help secure a grant for the Belair Girl Guides to finally upgrade the kitchen, and I was really excited to recently visit them to see their wonderful new facilities that supported a range of local tradies during this the most difficult of years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also delighted to be able to secure a grant for the Eden Hills Scout Group at Karinya Reserve. In 2019 the federal government committed to helping to fund the Eden Hills Scout Group to construct a brand new hall—and I think the existing hall is probably about the same age as the Belair Girl Guides' kitchen was. Through the new development, group leader Jeff Wheaton, his leaders and their members will finally have a functional hall which is long overdue given its age and its range of challenges, which include the fact that the hall is springing leaks. It requires new flooring and wiring, and is worse for wear following years battling white ants. The new hall will have a range of features, including a new kitchen and sufficient storage for the group's outdoor equipment and camping gear, including undercover storage for their trailers on site. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This hall will provide the Eden Hills Scout Group with the ability for their members to prepack for camps onsite as part of their program. I know that this is a particular feature Jeff and his team are so excited about, because at the moment their trailers are stored outdoors around the community on the properties of some very generous parents. The new hall will also provide the group with increased flexibility with a range of new activity spaces and will mean that other community groups can use this fabulous new community asset. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has also assisted the Darlington Scout Group to secure a grant to assist with replacing and levelling their flooring to provide a much safer experience for the Scouts. They have also been able to line and insulate their roof, which will make all of their members comfortable no matter the weather—and we've just had a few days of 40 degrees already in Adelaide, so I'm sure they'll appreciate it this year. I wish I had time to mention every single Scout and Girl Guide group in my area, but in closing I want to thank them and congratulate them for all they do, especially in this most difficult of years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  Today I'd like to recognise the incredible work of the many young people and adults involved in Scouts and Girl Guides across Indi. Indi is home to 16 Scout and 11 Girl Guide groups, stretching from Yea to the Indigo Valley and Corryong. These form a part of the 17,000 youth members and 5,000 adult volunteers involved in scouting programs across Victoria, which form part of an even larger story. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Girl Guides Victoria is connected to more than 10 million members in over 150 countries. Over 500 million people worldwide have participated in scouting programs. More than a billion people have been through the global scouting movement in the last 110 years. Scouts has stood the test of time in part because it speaks to the universal values that are as relevant today as they were a century ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouts Australia is about supporting individuals to develop a sense of personal identity and self-worth; the belief that young people are able and willing to take responsibility and contribute to society; and the importance of mutual support and help between members of a community to maximise quality of life for all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Girl Guides, the sister organisation of Scouts, also has lessons relevant for all young women in today's world. Back in 1909, at the formation of what was then the Boy Scouts, a small group of girls insisted that they wanted to be Scouts too. At the time, the idea of girls getting their hands dirty in outdoor activities like camping and hiking was seen as radical—a bit like a woman joining parliament! According to the Girl Guides' official history, the idea was denounced as a 'mischievous new development', a 'foolish and pernicious movement' and an 'idiotic sport'. But those girls won, and in 1910 the Girl Guides was established. Today it is one of the largest all-female organisations in the world. Girl Guides is about building confidence, self-reliance, team-building and leadership. I think all of us—men and women, boys and girls—can take inspiration from that early example of the first Girl Guides. I know that this year has been a tough one for all the Scouting groups in Victoria. Because of the restrictions, there were no in-person Guiding activities during terms 2 and 3, and only now are groups able to start meeting again in small gatherings and tentatively planning for a better 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to take this opportunity to celebrate the recently completed upgrade of the Baranduda Memorial Hall, home to the 1st Baranduda Scouts Group. Group leader Brendan Greaves leads a vibrant group of young people in the fast-growing Baranduda area near Wodonga. The upgraded hall, originally built in 1955, now has new insulation, new floors, two office spaces, a kitchen and bathrooms. Importantly, the upgrade also includes accessibility improvements, with a disabled shower and toilet and a ramp going out the front of the hall. I wish the 1st Baranduda Scouts Group all the best for a much brighter 2021 in their new facility, and I look forward to visiting them all there. And I congratulate all young people involved in Scouts and Guides right across Indi. The skills you develop, the lessons you learn through Scouting, will stay with you for a lifetime, and there is no better way to get out and enjoy the beautiful setting of north-east Victoria than to get out with your Scouts or Girl Guides group and have a camp. Best of luck, and, now that we can start to meet face to face again, I look forward to getting out there and visiting you right across Indi into the New Year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliamentary debate on integrity always hits a nerve. If you witnessed the matter of public importance debate on integrity this House held some months ago, you would know how swiftly rhetoric-driven debates descend into unconstructive name-calling and insinuation. The spirit of this motion is different. I want to thank in advance those speaking to this motion from the government side for their resolve to have this debate in a respectful manner—the member for Goldstein, the member for Bass, the member for Bennelong and other members on the government side who also wished to speak but could not secure a spot. I thank the member for Bennelong, in particular, for his leadership of the Menzies-Calwell club, who met to discuss the merits of a robust federal integrity commission and how to carve a path forward for that vision. This motion reflects the collaborative ethos that defines my politics as an independent member of the crossbench. This is how we write legislation we can all get behind, without ambushing one another or negotiating concessions in secret.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'bring on debate' campaign that started in my electorate of Indi is calling on parliament to debate the Australian Federal Integrity Commission Bill I introduced last month. Two weeks ago I met with the Attorney-General in his capacity as Leader of the House to ask him to allow debate, but he refused. There are many MPs on both sides of the House who are still committed to that debate. It's actually quite clear what most MPs are looking for in an integrity bill—a broad jurisdiction that covers criminal and non-criminal corruption; common rules for all, with no exceptionalism for MPs and their staff; strong investigative powers and procedural fairness safeguards; the ability to hold public hearings when in the public interest; public referrals and powers to self-initiate investigations; strong whistleblower protections; adequate and secure ongoing funding; and oversight by a parliamentary committee and independent inspector. These principles, which are embedded in the AFIC bill, are not new. The Senate has agreed to these principles. MPs from across the House have come to meet with me to support these principles through the Beechworth principles process I've run since February this year. The Australian Federal Police Association support these principles. The national integrity committee of former judges from the High Court, the Federal Court and supreme courts from across the nation support these principles. Transparency International Australia support these principles. I could spend the five-minute allocation listing the supporters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this morning, Professor AJ Brown launched Australia's second national integrity system assessment, which classifies the public hearing provisions in the AFIC bill as best practice. Those who have read the AFIC bill closely and have compared it to the state ICACs know that the AFIC bill builds on and improves lessons learnt in the states. Those MPs who worked with me to draft the AFIC bill know that treating AFIC the same as any state ICAC model is a total mischaracterisation. AFIC is focused on safeguards and protecting the public interest. It has special provisions to ensure personal reputations are not needlessly tarnished, including the right to request a private hearing. It includes special provisions for persons who are exonerated following an investigation. It includes protections against vexatious and frivolous claims, and it includes protections for those who are unknowingly caught up in corruption scandals or are forced to act beyond their will, such as junior staffers and frontline staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AFIC is a carefully crafted bill. Findings from the national integrity assessment released this morning show Australians increasingly view corruption as a major problem. The figure rose from 61 per cent in 2018 to 66 per cent in 2020. The proportion of those who believe the federal government is handling corruption issues very badly has also risen in the same time period—from 15 per cent to 19.4 per cent. Over 80 per cent of Australians want a robust federal integrity commission now as a matter of urgency. Through bushfires, the coronavirus and border closures, the people of Indi continue to implore me to pursue the AFIC bill and a better culture of integrity in federal politics. I will continue to heed their call, and I look forward to hearing from other members today whose constituents implore them to do the same.</span>

                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Gillespie, for pronouncing the word 'Goldstein' correctly. This may seem like pedantry but it's actually incredibly important. The electorate of Goldstein is named after a suffragette, Vida Goldstein. I can say with absolutely confidence that that's how her name is pronounced because, in my research for my first speech, I actually found an article from 1904 where she articulated not only how to pronounce her surname correctly but, more critically, how frustrated she was when people did not, which is why I've taken it upon myself to always correct people who do not, sometimes probably to my own detriment. But I would have thought that, as part of the celebration of the historical figures of our great nation, all members of this parliament, in particular, would take heed of fighting for the rights of women to vote, to buy property and to enter marriage on the same terms as men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to start this debate by acknowledging that every member of this chamber, and, of course, every member of the Senate as well, I would certainly hope, opposes corruption. The purpose for which we are elected to this parliament should categorically be to stand up for and advance the interests of the people of Australia. We will have our differences of opinion about what those best interests are and what the national interest is, but it does not have the objective of personal gain; it does not have the objective of achieving some sort of untoward end that isn't befitting of the public interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that the framework of oversight when people step over the line or do wrong is appropriate and proportionate so that it catches out wrongdoing. Sadly and unfortunately, that often isn't what has occurred at a state level, where legitimate issues have not been pursued—and I talk here particularly about the case of New South Wales. More critically, the use of corruption bodies should not become a pathway for show trials and public prosecutions against which people have limited recourse. We all saw this recently in one of the most disgraceful public acts I have ever seen. A New South Wales premier, who was a witness, not a person of investigation or interest, was dragged through a public trial, taken before an anticorruption hearing, and their personal life was used effectively as a political weapon. I think it is disgraceful. If there is corruption, there should be an investigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the police conduct an investigation of criminal behaviour, they don't do so in the full public square because they need to build a case. Anticorruption bodies should build that case. If there is one that is entirely legitimate and reasonable and should be referred to a public prosecutor then should they do so. The matter, if a case is brought, then goes to court, where there is a proper trial. But to do investigations as the basis of a public debate simply seeks to tarnish people's reputations without any justification. We know specifically the conduct of the shadow Attorney-General: whenever anybody does anything in this place and he disagrees with it, he refers people off to the Australian Federal Police. He has a pad, like a dodgy doctor issuing dodgy prescriptions. It's all he does whenever he wants to score a political point and he is prepared to use any institution as a means of publicly prosecuting his argument. He has even referred me onto a case which was simply absurd and ridiculous, if he had thought about it for more than about 10 seconds, but it didn't stop him doing so because he sees these institutions as vehicles for political attack. If you want an anticorruption body that has integrity and has public confidence, you cannot provide a pathway where it can be used as a point of public attack. That goes for any member in this chamber, it goes for any member in the other chamber and it goes to the heart of whether you want to have a system of integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the independent member for Indi wishes to have her bill debated and is more than entitled to make that argument. But, at the same time, members of this chamber who were elected in this government went to the people of their electorates and said they would debate, negotiate and support a piece of legislation brought forward by the government. They want us to break the trust we took to the people, but we are not breaking the trust and the relationship we had with the people at the last election simply to indulge the member, who did not get a number of members successfully elected with her party.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I rise in support of this motion by the member for Indi and, in particular, I would like to use this time to talk about the Menzies-Calwell club that is very much championed not only by the member for Indi but also the member for Bennelong, who is also here today, and a number of other honourable members. This club is about bringing together all sides of politics to talk about policy ideas and not to regress into partisan pointscoring. It is a club or a connection open for all, and they meet every Tuesday lunchtime. The name recognises the extraordinary friendship between two former members, two gentlemen: the late Robert Menzies, the longest serving Prime Minister of Australia, and the then Leader of the Opposition Arthur Calwell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2009 <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span>'s Michelle Grattan made a podcast with the daughters of these two gentlemen, Heather Henderson nee Menzies and Dr Mary Elizabeth Calwell. I would urge anyone who is interested in politics to find it and listen to it. It is free and it is really quite inspiring. The women share personal stories of their fathers and talk about that extraordinary friendship of those two gentlemen. The women were honest and open and acknowledged the friendship had its rough moments, such as during the Vietnam War, but it endured. Why did it endure? Well, because, for one, they respected each other. While they may not have agreed, they recognised the other person's point of view as a legitimate alternative. Politics was less about personality and it was more about policy because we had an impartial and objective Public Service that was able to give free and frank advice. Interestingly, the daughters also remarked on the absence of political staffers, who they think were perhaps a little less helpful as far as supporting the connection between members of parliament in this place. It endured because Calwell and Menzies recognised the importance of empathy, knowledge and experience. Perhaps it was a gentler time. Perhaps it was a time when people were just more respectful of each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that my community want to see politicians in this place work together. They hate the bickering. They hate watching question time. They hate the noise, the shouting and the performance. They want to see us work together for the good of the nation, and I think that's what Menzies and Calwell wanted to see. My community—and I think this speaks for many communities in Australia—don't want to see political pointscoring or factional games or the idea that we won't put something forward just because it's not done by the ruling party. They want to see this place used for what it should be used for—that is, the contest for great ideas and the contest for debate. As someone who sits on the crossbench and who often sees herself as a bit like the Switzerland of the parliament—and I think that is probably something that most crossbenchers feel about themselves—I can say that we don't do tribal politics. That means that we're open to talking to any member of parliament about good ideas, because we are all here for the same people. We all have the same employers—the people who elect us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this motion encourages some new members to come along to the Menzies-Calwell lunch and to perhaps reflect on those great gentlemen of times gone by, to perhaps debate pieces of legislation or at least have a robust discussion about what a federal integrity commission should look like, and to perhaps be a little honest with each other around integrity in this place and how we lift ourselves up and how we lift each other up in order for this to be a better place and for us to be better representatives. So I commend the member for her motion, and I look forward to continuing to sit down at the table at the Menzies-Calwell lunch.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (18<span class="HPS-Time">:27</span>):  A few weeks ago I was fortunate to be invited by the Multicultural Society of Tasmania to discuss the role of the federal government and, more specifically, my role as the federal representative in our Northern Tasmanian community. There were a lot of great questions asked; however, there was quite a focus on trust in government and trust in those elected to represent our constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trust in government is paramount. There is no better example of this than what we have seen this year, with state and federal governments asking much of our communities in order to keep us all safe. We have asked for people to stay away from loved ones; to put a halt on activities, from sport to entertainment, that bring joy to so many; and to take on the extra responsibility of home-schooling while also working—all to keep our communities healthy. It was incredibly pleasing to see how communities listened and trusted the government's advice and adhered to these best practices, which has put our country in a situation that seems so different to what other Western countries are battling right now. We, as elected representatives, cannot take this trust for granted and nor should we be above reproach. Like the member for Indi, I do believe that establishing a robust federal integrity commission is essential to arresting the declining public trust in institutions and restoring Australians' faith in the democratic system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to establishing a Commonwealth integrity commission to enhance accountability across the public sector. Earlier this month, the government released an exposure draft of the legislation to establish the CIC for extensive public consultation. The draft legislation is the result of detailed planning to ensure that the new body has both the resources and the powers it needs to investigate allegations of criminal corrupt conduct that could occur across the public sector. Proper and thorough consultation is essential to ensuring a robust commission. A thorough consultation process has been taken in the lead-up to the draft legislation, and the government has said it is committed to further national comprehensive consultation. As part of this, a series of consultation sessions is being arranged for the law enforcement and public sector groups that would be regulated under the legislation, as well as roundtable meetings with civil society representatives, academia and other stakeholder representatives from all states and territories. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the member for Indi's contribution to this debate and I appreciate her putting forward such a comprehensive proposal. It's important to point out that our government's proposed integrity commission has some broad consistency with many of the principles that inform the member for Indi's AFIC Bill. Specifically, the CIC will be an independent statutory agency with broad jurisdiction over the federal Public Service and members of parliament and their staff. It will have appropriate powers, with the CIC to be given powers greater than those of a royal commission. And it will provide expert capability to investigate allegations of corruption within the public sector, including conduct that occurred before the establishment of the CIC. However, I note that it does depart from the member for Indi's approach in some critical areas, including on the issues of retrospectivity, how corrupt conduct is defined and public hearings. It's my hope that the government and the member for Indi can work together to find some common ground on these issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned to audience members at the multicultural society last week, Australia has a solid anticorruption reputation. It is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world, including in the most recent corruption perceptions index, where we're ranked equal 12th with Canada, the UK and Austria. However, despite the trust shown in our government during the global pandemic, we must continue to be accountable and transparent as elected representatives. The draft legislation is a step in the right direction, but I look forward to reviewing the appropriate changes and updates after further consultation with key stakeholders in 2021.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (18<span class="HPS-Time">:31</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for putting the motion to the House. Consensus politics is vitally important to a functioning democracy. Yes, debate and disagreement are also a part of it, but we need to get beyond political pointscoring and party divisions. Martin Luther King Junior summed up the role of a leader well. He said that a genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a moulder of the consensus. The role of a leader is to recognise the issues important to the population and to the national interest and mould the consensus for the good of the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On so many issues and some of the most important in our times we've seen bitterly divided politics for far too long. This has driven stagnation on key issues, which is not in the national interest. The issues of a federal integrity commission and climate change are two of the primary examples where it is in the national interest to set a clear policy and take action. Over 80 per cent of Australians want clear policy direction and action on both of these issues, according to the Australia Institute. I suggest that, given a free vote, the majority of parliamentarians in this place would also like to vote for action on these issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet party divisions and an inability or unwillingness to achieve consensus have dragged our parliament into disrepute. We've not demonstrated leadership or ability to mould consensus. Time and again it's been left to the crossbench to lead the charge on these important issues––to do the hard work, lead independent consultation and develop legislation and present it to the parliament for debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Federal Integrity Commission Bill presents a strong and well supported model for integrity. The need for this legislation was emphasised by the release of the Transparency International Australia report just today, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's national integrity system: the blueprint for action</span>. The report found that the corruption perception score for Australia has declined eight points since 2012. Correspondingly, in the last two years alone the percentage of Australians who think that corruption in government is a quite big or very big problem has increased by five per cent to 66 per cent. That's a large proportion of the population that has a strong belief that there is corruption in our government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not being helped by the government's reaction to investigations, I suggest respectfully. Rather than increased transparency of grants, they've removed the concept of merit from the criteria upon which grants are provided. Similarly, the creation of a national cabinet in the place of COAG has further obfuscated the discussions and agreements made between federal, state and territory governments. We see an increasing of the veil of secrecy around government. Instead of increasing that secrecy, we need to look closely at the actions outlined in the blueprint to urgently address the issue of corruption and the absence of integrity in the country. Many of those actions are mirrored in the Australian federal integrity commission legislation presented by the member for Indi and referenced in the motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) Bill 2020 presents a proven model for addressing the challenges of climate change, having been implemented in the UK and New Zealand and now tabled in Canada. This bill is up for inquiry by the House Committee on the Environment and Energy, and submissions are numerous and continue. My intent for this inquiry is an opportunity to build consensus around the need to have sensible legislation on climate change. It's well past due.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, the climate change bill and the AFIC Bill, are aimed at bringing the parliament together around a nonpartisan platform to address some of the most important challenges that we face today. The strength of the crossbench is that it lies in between the two major parties. I agree with the member for Mayo that it often feels like Switzerland. We can be the consensus builders. We listen to our constituents and to the Australian public more broadly and bring to the fore the issues that they care about most. We work with both sides to lead and shape a consensus. We do the hard yards to garner support and consult with the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government may be hesitant to adopt the exact legislation tabled by those of us on the crossbench, the consensus that we are able to build smooths the way for similar legislation to be implemented shortly thereafter. The pressure built by crossbenchers on these key issues of national importance is key to shaping consensus on significant issues and driving change. As a member of the crossbench, it's really important for the Prime Minister and the government to work with all members of parliament to ensure that leadership in government is on behalf of all Australians, to shape the consensus in the best interest of the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  Thank you to the member for Indi for bringing forward this important and time-sensitive debate. You'll notice that I'm standing very close to the centre, where common sense dwells. I'd like to thank the member for bringing forward this debate in the name of the Menzies-Calwell group. For the uninitiated, the Menzies-Calwell group is a group of MPs who meet for lunch on Tuesdays to discuss in an open and bipartisan manner. We take our name and tradition from the group's namesakes, when they were Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition respectively—and respectfully. Every Friday, they would meet for lunch to discuss the affairs of the day to ensure that the two parties could work well together. They would listen to each other with respect and they would set politics aside. We'll be meeting again tomorrow in the Members' Dining Room, and all MPs and senators are welcome and encouraged to attend on the condition that politics are left at the door. Politics is forbidden in the Menzies-Calwell group, but policy most certainly is not. We want to develop ideas, not just exercise our debating skills, for the betterment of our communities and all of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When meeting in the name of friendship—with colleagues regardless of party, or even if you don't have a party—and bipartisanship, integrity is the virtue we all hold dear. Integrity in parliament is something we all want to and need to improve upon. Polls always show that faith in politics and its institutions, but especially politics, is at an all-time low. Dwindling majorities for the main parties and the growth of minor parties demonstrate how people are turning their back on politics as it has been. They are turned off by the way we engage with each other and, through the game of politics, rarely make good progress. It is a stinging message that we all should hear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just politicians who need to be checked in on. One hat I wear is the Chair of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities. As such, the behaviour of public officials at Western Sydney airport has come up before my recent inquiry. We have seen much about this on the news recently, but there is a broader undercurrent of fortunate speculators pocketing huge sums of taxpayer funds on the back of government infrastructure. There is a great need for a commission in the infrastructure planning space, and I'll be talking about that very soon. I'm not a lawyer, and while I'm very familiar with courts I prefer the outdoor type, with a bat and a ball! But there is no doubt that such an organisation is necessary for the proper functioning of government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are of course two integrity commissions in the mix right now. There is the one that we're discussing today, the Beechworth principles, and as we all know the government has invested time in putting forward its own version of the CIC. The government's proposed CIC bill is similarly directed towards the objectives that Dr Haines has identified—an independent, effective anticorruption body with wide powers to properly investigate all complaints. The latter is going out to consideration where it will be examined by legal minds far greater than mine. This consultation will be critically important for a bill of this nature, where the broadest considerations must be listened to in order to ensure that any commission that is set up is fit for purpose and does not create any unexpected results. Critically, I would like to call on the government to listen closely to the results of the consultation. This must be an open, transparent and purposeful inquiry. Consultations where the government's suggestions are rubberstamped and recommendations are swept under the carpet would not only be counterproductive; they would be the embodiment of the problem that this sort of commission is trying to combat. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish I would like to congratulate the member for Indi for her incredible work on this commission. The effort to put together the foundations of an integrity commission at the same time as being an independent MP without the resources of a major party is an incredible feat. I congratulate you on the impressive fruits of your labours. This debate is important, and it must be open. I thank everyone for being part of this conversation. I hope that by working together in the spirit of Menzies and Calwell we will soon have an integrity commission that is fit for purpose.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I rise to present my private member's motion on an issue that must be spoken about in order that it never happens again. COVID-19 has unveiled a sleeping giant that has surprised and horrified many of us—the power of the states to control and determine the activities of its citizens in ways not experienced before in Australia's history. All of this happened in an 82,000-square-kilometre region where there were zero or a handful of cases for eight months, my electorate of Mallee. Border closures have caused extreme levels of disadvantage and suffering for families, businesses, communities and our economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Situated in the north-west of Victoria, Mallee is bordered by both South Australia and New South Wales. This unique location meant that three Premiers imposed restraint on the lives of those locals, from farmers in Wycheproof to schoolkids in Piangil, patients in Mildura, businesses in Murrayville, families in Kaniva and everyone in between. The people of Mallee have shared with me countless stories of hardship, frustration and grief. In September I sent an electorate-wide email to check in on Mallee locals and request their feedback, to which I received over 700 responses. Only one in 10 people supported the state government's restrictions. Agricultural workers and businesses were hit hard. Daniel Berlin from Murrayville is heavily reliant on access to Pinnaroo in South Australia for his farming business. He brings 80 per cent of his produce into South Australia in the form of cereal grains. Coming off the worst drought in decades, the border closures were yet another strain for dryland farmers like Daniel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While farmers and businesses suffered and kids could couldn't go to school, Mallee residents contended with severely restricted access to health care. Put simply, when weighing up the impact of border closures against risk of transmission, this basic human right was unjustifiably limited for Mallee locals. Hundreds and hundreds of patients in Mildura, who would normally rely on visiting medical officers from Adelaide, have suffered intensely. Several specialists would normally visit Mildura regularly, including surgeons, dentists, ophthalmologists and radiographers. However, they have not visited the region for eight months because the South Australian government would not grant them leave to visit Victoria and return to Adelaide without quarantining—not good for business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the pandemic, I had the pleasure to meet and represent John and Jeanette Feder from Lillimur. I worked closely with John and Jeanette to fight for them to access South Australia for John's cancer treatments. I'm very sad to say that John recently passed away from his illness. It tears me apart to know that the last few months of John's life were made vastly more difficult because of border closures. I want to take this opportunity to honour John, his life and his memory, and the strength he displayed throughout this ordeal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many inspirational stories of leadership shown by Mallee locals throughout this difficult period. Di Thornton is a nurse practitioner from Murrayville who owns and operates Mallee Border Health Centre in Pinnaroo in South Australia. She was forced to close her clinic when the border restrictions began and she and her staff were unable to cross to South Australia. I worked closely with Di to assist countless people with applications to get across the border for health care. The fact is access to health care should never be this difficult. As a modern nation, we can't allow this type of response to occur again. It is un-Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments except Western Australia agreed to a framework for national reopening that included an agreement on proportionate measures for controlling outbreaks; effective testing; contact tracing; and targeted hotspot controls. They agreed the removal of domestic border restrictions is a key pillar to support COVID-normal Australia. Merely days after this agreement several premiers reinstated border restrictions against South Australia. The hypocrisy would be laughable if it were not so serious. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until a vaccine arrives and is distributed, we cannot continue this type of reactive response. Border restrictions unduly impact regional communities. The mantra 'We're all in this together' is a joke in cross-border communities, who feel expendable and left behind by state premiers. I will continue to advocate for change in the hope that we can prevent this kind of devastation being wrought on cross-border communities again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I first want to acknowledge the member for Mallee for her advocacy for her community during the border crisis and for bringing this motion to this House. Together, we had over 25 meetings with the New South Wales border commissioner—and I'm sure she had them with the South Australian border commissioner on top of that. We share the belief that we need scientific foundations for policies that cause this level of harm or we don't have them at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One week ago today, I stood on the bridge that links Albury and Wodonga over the Murray River. Gone were the police, gone were the ADF and gone were the bollards, the concrete dividers, the tents and the floodlights that comprised the border checkpoint for 138 long days and long nights. At 12.01 am that morning the border opened up again. Cars streamed across as DJ Steve Bowen, a fixture at hundreds of local weddings and formals, provided the backing track for this historic moment. Along the Murray, the border communities of Corowa, Wahgunyah, Jingellic, Walwa and many others were quietly reunited. Hours later peak traffic returned to normal with thousands of commuters crossing the border unimpeded for the first time in months. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate we're experiencing a moment of cautious pride. In this moment, it's tempting to forget what we've just been through. But the border closure has been a deeply traumatic experience, as the member for Mallee has just recounted. For many, it rivals the impacts of bushfires that devastated my community just six months before. My office has dealt with over 700 individual constituent concerns about the border closure, each with their own story of heartbreak, despair, frustration or confusion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sudden announcement of the hard border closure on 6 July and the chaos in the week that followed was only a taste of what was to come. The mayors of local councils were not consulted, nor were schools or healthcare, construction, agriculture or business sectors. Decades of work to bring the region together was wiped away in the stroke of a pen. The long awaited signing of the Albury-Wodonga regional deal, known as Two Cities One Community, scheduled just days after the border closed, was changed—so it happened without fanfare, and the irony was lost on no-one. An agreement on border closures was on the agenda for the national cabinet. Time and time again, we both called for it. Each meeting ended without one. There was no protocol, no plan, applications for exemptions piled up, and, while we waited, jobs were lost, family members got sick and some of them died alone. Sensible solutions were proposed by the community—move the border north of Albury so it doesn't split us in two; bring whole communities into the border zone; introduce a daily life permit—but progress was slow and often too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the framework for the national reopening, as the member just described, a key principle is that response measures and decisions should be proportionate to the risk of harm and transmission. As a nurse and a rural public health researcher with a degree in public health, I am the first to support public health measures; I've been doing so all the way through this pandemic. But I find myself asking: was this border closure proportionate to the problem at hand? Was the crippling economic cost and human toll worth it? Once established, the so-called 'ring of steel' kept the virus contained in Melbourne and only two cases were reported in my border communities in the second wave. So, under these circumstances, I find myself struggling to say, 'Yes it was proportionate; yes it was worth it.' I don't think so. We need to learn the lessons of this experience and understand what can be done better should the borders—God help us—close again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased this will be examined by the New South Wales government, which will conduct a review of the border closure response. But, in the interests of transparency, this must be public so that border communities on both sides can participate, and the findings and recommendations must be published. Victorians wore the cost of border closure but did so without New South Wales government support, and their voices deserve to be heard. For those who work daily within the two jurisdictions, we need to learn valuable lessons in the areas of health, education, agriculture, farming and emergency services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I share the New South Wales Premier's hope that this is the last time in our lifetime that the border is closed, but, until we have a vaccine, the threat remains. I commend the work of the border commissioners and I commend the work of the electorate officers in my office and right across the border, and the MPs I worked with, including the member for Mallee. I thank the community, who bore the brunt of so much anguish. We must do better if this is ever to happen again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the motion moved by the honourable member for Mallee. I note that, amongst other things, it recognises that metropolitan and regional Victorians continue to face significant limitations on their freedoms due to COVID-19 restrictions, commiserates with business owners forced to shut their doors, notes that many businesses will not survive continued lockdowns and calls on the Victorian government to give Victorians their freedom back. It's some aspects of that part of the motion that I wish to address tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I welcome the report that there are now no active COVID-19 cases in Victoria and there have been no new locally acquired cases for 30 consecutive days. This has enabled the Victorian government to announce further easing of restrictions on 8 November, following the initial period of no locally acquired infections at the end of October. So, with 30 days with no new reported cases, following a peak of cases in early August—685 cases on 4 August—case numbers in Victoria have declined steadily, with no new acquired cases. Despite low case numbers, the daily average number of tests conducted in Victoria has remained relatively high, at approximately 14,000 tests per day, with an increase through early November in response to the South Australian outbreak. This is a tribute to the people of Victoria. The people of Victoria acted overwhelmingly in a responsible manner in relation to this. Yes, there were some idiots who did things which nobody supports, but, overwhelmingly, the people of Victoria showed common sense and did what was needed to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's a cost for this, and that's what the motion goes to, in part. There is the economic cost affecting businesses and the jobs of individuals. There is also the health cost, particularly the mental health cost that comes from this. In my electorate, I know of businesses—and I suspect every member from Victoria and possibly other parts of Australia knows of businesses—which have gone to the wall because of what's happened in the last few months. I know businesses that will not reopen after Christmas. They've been hanging on as best they can, but I know businesses that will not reopen in my electorate and in metropolitan Melbourne. This has had a devastating impact on businesses, jobs and individuals. Part of that impact has translated into health effects. Regrettably, I have had reports—and I suspect many others have too—virtually every week, from friends and associates about someone that they know who committed suicide. That's the reality, in terms of the depression and the desperation. Some of that is related to what I was talking about earlier, in terms of the impact this has had on jobs, businesses and, therefore, families and communities. There is a real impact from this, and it's not over yet, unfortunately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic measures which the government has taken—JobKeeper and JobSeeker—have been important in trying to keep people in jobs, but of course they will come to an end at some stage and there's been some scaling back of that, so we're not out of the woods as far as this is concerned. Also, the measures in relation to health—putting more money into direct health supports, enabling telehealth, and things like that—are all good measures that have been taken over the last few months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude on this note. There were failures. I won't go through them tonight but there were failures in terms of tracing and quarantining, particularly in Victoria. In terms of tracing, we've only just got the QR code approach that other states have had. We can't just forget these failures and say, 'We have to move on.' We must learn from the lessons. We need to ensure that, in future, if there are responses, they are proportionate to the risks, they are precise in their breadth and they are consistent in their application. Finally, I say that future policy responses should not pit one group of Australians against another. They should not pit people from metropolitan Melbourne against regional Victoria or people from Victoria against people from New South Wales or South Australia or any other state, for that matter. For the life of me, I can't imagine that the framers of the Constitution, who put section 92 in there to enable interstate trade freely, would have been in favour of restrictions on movement, unless it were very precise and for very good reasons. We must learn from the lessons of the last few months.</span>

I hope that you will be as glowing about my comments as those of the previous speaker, Deputy Speaker Gillespie. It's always wonderful to know that we have an impartial chair in these sessions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really disappointed that this motion has not been withdrawn. I actually expected better from the member for Mallee. This motion is out of date. I accept that it was first tabled on 26 October and things have changed in Victoria. It is also just a political attack. It only attacks the Victorian state government. Nowhere in this motion does it attack the South Australian government or the New South Wales government, who actually closed the borders to Victorians. The New South Wales government closed the border to Victoria; the South Australian government closed the border to Victoria. That's what created so many issues, heartbreak and hurt in border communities like Mildura and Wodonga. You cannot put the actions of other state governments on the Victorian government—with no help from the federal government, mind you. Their app didn't work. We heard both previous speakers from the government attack the Victorian Labor government for the lack of contact tracing. What did the federal government's app do? It may have helped in 14 contacts. We were told by the Prime Minister that if you download the app you'll be able to go to the pub. That didn't happen. We were told by the Prime Minister that if you download the app borders will open. It didn't happen because the app didn't work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion doesn't acknowledge any fault on behalf of their own government or the lack of what they did. What their government did was start to cut JobKeeper before our businesses reopened. That is what has put people out of work. This government is winding back support before we're through the health crisis. If this government did what the Victorian government did in their budget last week and announced massive investment, that would help every business try to save every job that they can. But there's no mention of that in this motion. No, instead it is just an attack on the Victorian government. It's an attack on people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a regional MP. The ring of steel was just below my electorate, and my people in my community were thankful for it. They were thankful because it was about controlling the virus where it was in Melbourne. People in my electorate overwhelmingly felt empathy for people in Melbourne. They felt sorry and they felt guilty. There was almost this guilt that we had that we still had life relatively normal. Our construction businesses did not close, Our hospitality businesses were able to do takeaway in the peak. Yes, it was hard and, yes, we have lost jobs. But we have lost jobs in my electorate because this government did not extend JobKeeper to the university sector. We have lost jobs in my electorate not because of the Victorian shutdown for health reasons; we have lost jobs because this government did not extend JobKeeper to people who are here on a temporary work visa. We lost jobs in my electorate and all throughout Victoria because this government did not extend JobKeeper to people who are casuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How dare people come here and put forward motions criticising a state government for responding to a health crisis and getting Victoria through it. What was the alternative? They're not epidemiologists. What was the alternative—that we end up like the UK, that we end up like France or that we end up like the US? That is what happens when you don't have infection control in place. I acknowledge that it was tough and I know that people in my community have done it tough, like every other Victorian. But most of them stand shoulder to shoulder with the outcome. We are now COVID free. We did it the hard way and we did it the long way, but we got there and now we're on the path to recovery.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is disappointing that this motion was not withdrawn and replaced with a motion that recognised what Victorians did and the leadership of Dan Andrews and the Victorian government—because they did it against opposition from this government, this government who have refused to work with Dan Andrews, refused to work with the Victorian people and not backed businesses. We have already lost jobs because they wouldn't extend JobKeeper once. Will they do it now? We will lose more jobs if they do not help sectors like the arts sector, like the hospitality sector and like the university sector. How many more jobs do we have to lose before the government acts? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional Victorians are backing in the Victorian plan. It is disappointing that the regional Liberal and National MPs in this place are not backing in the plan. Get behind regional Victorians and get behind the plan. Support these businesses to grow, support them to recover and give them back JobKeeper until we are through this recession. They are simple things that this government can do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I second the member for Mallee's motion advocating for Victoria to fully reopen in a COVID-safe manner. This means opening the doors of businesses, restoring the cherished freedom of Victorians and ending the crippling uncertainty that has afflicted regional communities in our state, particularly in the border regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Chisholm, I have witnessed the dire effects of the Andrews government's draconian lockdown measures. Small business has been given no respite or quarter. Small business is the lifeblood of our country and the communities within. The Victorian Labor Party has time and time again stood in the way of small businesses trying to survive this period. The Andrews government's response was extreme. It was an extreme solution designed to make up for their equally extreme mishandling of hotel quarantine. We wish the Victorian government had handled this crisis with the same care and competence that our neighbours in New South Wales did, but what is done is done. It wasn't Victorians' fault, and I am so proud of the courage and perseverance displayed by Victorians in getting through the worst of the latest crisis. The epidemiological data for Victoria is now at the point where health experts believe it is safe to reopen our state fully so long as we also stay COVID safe. The Victorian health system has recovered and built its capacity to deal with this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the Victorian outbreak, many business owners have been forced to shut their doors. Sadly, many of those doors won't ever open again. It is these business owners I am talking to when I offer my commiserations. It is truly gut-wrenching to know that many small-business owners have had to close the door permanently on their life's work. We will do whatever is in our power as a federal government to put Victorians back on their feet and to encourage all states to work together to avoid the border closures that have disproportionately affected regional border communities. This coalition government will continue to act decisively in the nation's interests, to help us to bounce back from the economic consequences of this disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just the economic front on which we are continuing to fight. We realise that this virus and the measures taken to combat it have caused significant issues in the space of mental health and general wellbeing. This is particularly the case in Victoria, where the outbreaks and lockdowns were so much more severe. So we want to send a message loud and clear: protecting the nation's interests necessitates protecting Victorian interests. That is why we have invested $29.6 million to establish 15 HeadtoHelp clinics across regional and metropolitan Victoria. These clinics will operate free of charge and significantly boost the capacity of our existing mental health system over the next year. This means more accessibility and more help for Victorians who need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But some Victorians are still being left in the lurch by the current restrictions enforced by the Andrews government. A business in my electorate, Vogue Ballroom, located in Burwood East, is still unable to operate. They have been continually forced to push bookings back and can't get any peace of mind. For them, this lockdown has not been eased, and they are still paying the penalty for Daniel Andrews's lockdown policy. My colleagues and I believe that it is time to unleash Victoria again, and that's why I firmly support the member for Mallee's motion today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  Reading this motion, I thought: 'Surely not? Surely this motion is going to be withdrawn now that Victoria is in the state in which it is.' But perhaps the only conclusion I can draw about a motion talking about a Victorian lockdown that doesn't exist anymore is that it was sent in via Malcolm Turnbull's NBN! That could be the only reason why it took so long to get to this place and finally be debated. But if this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that you don't play politics with a pandemic. You don't play politics with a pandemic, because, if you do, it looks like it does in the United States, where the political class, the political leadership, is undermining health efforts, undermining the experts and undermining the efforts of those people trying to deal with this pandemic. Instead we are seeing the people of the United States resist the health measures that are designed to keep them safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't play politics with a pandemic––which is exactly what this government has done. This government, I'm sure, are proud of their efforts over that time, picking on Labor states and Labor premiers. It worked really well in the Northern Territory, it worked really well in the ACT and it worked well in Queensland after their relentless attacks on Labor premiers. That went really well. Playing politics with a pandemic is really great stuff, and I encourage you, as a federal government, to do that to Victoria, because I can tell you one thing: Victorians are absolutely sick of it. They are absolutely sick of the Prime Minister lecturing Victoria about contact tracing, after his excuse for contact tracing was to develop an app that they are only announcing today that they are starting from scratch. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorians are absolutely sick of a Prime Minister blaming Victorian Labor for the state of the economy in Victoria, when this government is the one which, during stage 4 lockdown, decided that instead of supporting Victorian businesses they were going to reduce the JobKeeper supplement from $1,500 to $1,200. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We couldn't even have family over for dinner. Child care was shut down unless you were a permitted worker. We were tackling a pandemic. We were at 725 cases on 5 August—a comparable state to the United Kingdom, who are now tracking 20,000 cases. France has 50,000 cases a day. But instead, the Victorians and the Victorian people decided: 'No, that is not what we're going to do. We are going to listen to the health advice, we are going to respect the experts, we are going to respect the scientists and we are going to respect the politicians who are trying to lead us through this Victorian pandemic and lead us out of the second wave.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, at that very moment of need, at the very moment when Victorians needed their federal government, when Victorians needed support from those opposite, what did we get? A $300 cut, a cut of support to businesses, to families, to mums and dads. And it hurt. Thankfully, Victoria is now in a place where we are not in lockdown, we are not in a position where we are counting hundreds of cases a day and we are not in a position where our hospitals are being overrun. It is because of the efforts of Victorians to listen to the health advice, to listen to the health experts and to listen to the Premier of Victoria, who each and every day admitted mistakes. It wasn't perfect. He fronted up every day––120 press conferences in a row. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How many times has the Prime Minister stood up and said, 'You know what, that contact tracing app that I said was our ticket to freedom and our ticket out of lockdown'––how many times has the Prime Minister stood up and taken a press conference about that? How many times has the Prime Minister stood up and said, 'That JobKeeper cut, the JobSeeker cut that I made during the middle of stage 4 lockdown—that was my fault, I apologise, and here is how we will fix it.' Not once. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we won't be lectured to by these people opposite, constantly undermining the health efforts, constantly undermining the people who were trying to get Victoria through a pandemic, constantly undermining the efforts of scientists and experts to keep people safe. Instead they have got conspiracy theorists and they are playing political games only with Labor premiers. Victorians are sick of it. I know this, we know this in Victoria, but I would encourage those opposite: if you want to keep playing your petty political games, then go for it and you will face the repercussions at the next election. Victorians did something remarkable, no thanks to those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (19<span class="HPS-Time">:13</span>):  I never thought I would see the day, in my own country, when human rights, freedoms and liberties of Australians would be swept away so ruthlessly, as they have been under the guise of this pandemic––the most ruthless of all being the state of Victoria, where over the last six months people's basic rights have simply been crushed by force or by fines. A state government's desperate attempts to compensate for their own failings have seen our fellow Australians fall victim to heavy-handed, big-brother style law enforcement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen police enter a family home and arrest a mother in front of the kids. Her crime? Posting on Facebook. People have been fined thousands of dollars for driving to work, for exercising, for travelling apparently too far to go and get food and essentials. We watched a young woman being choked and forced to the ground by a Victorian policeman for not wearing a mask. It's clear the Victorian government has gone way too far. But the question is why? Is the virus as bad as the mainstream media and the opportunistic politicians have told us it is, or is the cure worse than the disease?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the facts. In Australia, the median age of death from COVID-19 is 86. The average life expectancy in Australia is 82. If you're young and healthy, the chances of dying from coronavirus are very, very slim. It makes no sense to lock up healthy people when we can just protect those that actually need protection. Government enforced lockdowns, such as those in Victoria, will have severe effects on the mental health and the financial stability of many Australians. The World Health Organization has said: 'Lockdowns can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities and societies. There is even doubt that they actually work at all.' The American Institute for Economic Research compared global lockdown responses with COVID-19 cases and deaths, and they found very little correlation. The Victorian government has mandated the use of masks, specifically recommending cloth masks as adequate protection from coronavirus. Well, the Australian Department of Health's Infection Control Expert Group stated that the use of cloth face masks is almost completely ineffective and may even increase the likelihood of infection. The DANMASK-19 study, a randomised trial of 6,000 participants, found that there was no statistically significant difference between those who wore masks and those who did not when it comes to being infected by COVID-19. While the efficacy of masks is questionable, the enforcement of mask wearing by law is detestable. Virus or no virus, people cannot and should not be forced to cover their face for fear of financial penalty, or worse, in a democratic society like Australia. It is simply a violation of individual freedom. It sickens me that we have got to a point where I have to stand here in this parliament and actually say that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the virus first broke out, we expected the mortality rate would be much higher than it is now, particularly for people who are fit, healthy and under the age of 60. We thought it was going to be bad, and yet there are indications now that the mortality rate for COVID-19 overall is actually declining, even in countries where the transmission rate is increasing. In Europe, the infection rate has risen significantly but there hasn't been a matching increase in hospitalisations or deaths. The US study of COVID-19 tests in Detroit found that the viral load on swabs has decreased as the pandemic has progressed, correlating with a decrease in deaths. The UK built seven specialised hospitals for the purpose of dealing with a second wave of COVID-19 patients. Most of them are completely empty, and some are now being repurposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fatality rate of COVID-19 in Australia is 0.4 per cent. That doesn't account for all of those who are asymptomatic and haven't been tested. According to the World Health Organization, it's very rare for those that are asymptomatic to transmit the virus. A recent report published by the World Health Organization stated that 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases are mild or asymptomatic. If that information is correct, why subject 100 per cent of the population to draconian lockdowns and business-destroying restrictions when you could just recommend protections to older and vulnerable citizens and quarantine those who are actually showing COVID-19 symptoms?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be calls of conspiracy theories and all the rest, but if you tell me that a state government removing basic freedoms and liberties from law-abiding Australians by intimidation, fine or force is okay then you're not Australian. Our national anthem says, 'Australians all let us rejoice for we are young and free.' What's free about this? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move this motion, recognising the unjust expulsion of a member of this House and a century of injustice endured by his family and descendants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh Mahon was a founding member of federal parliament, back in 1901. He is the only member ever to have been expelled from federal parliament. He represented the federal seat of Coolgardie, and then Kalgoorlie, for the mighty Australian Labor Party. Hugh Mahon was born in Ireland and came to Australia in 1882, having been a journalist and political activist in his mother country. Hugh Mahon was expelled from this parliament on 11 November 1920, Remembrance Day, the day Ned Kelly was hanged. Although Ned was of Irish descent, he wasn't quite as innocent as Hugh Mahon! Mahon attended an Ireland league meeting in Melbourne on 7 November 1920, where he savagely attacked British policy and the Empire. Two days after that meeting, Prime Minister Billy Hughes read a portion of Mahon's speech in parliament and asked Mahon if it was correct. Hughes had already decided on his course of action in his party room beforehand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> reflects that Mahon protested that he had never been disobedient to the rules of the House or shown disrespect to the Speaker of the House. When Prime Minister Hughes asked whether the House could take it that the report of his statement was correct, Mahon responded, 'You are not to take anything of the kind.' A letter was sent to Mahon advising him that a motion was to be moved in parliament calling for his expulsion. Mahon informed the Prime Minister in writing that his speech was not seditious or disloyal and that the reported extracts were incomplete and taken out of context. Hughes wanted Mahon to trample the Shamrock and Mahon would never do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, Mahon was unable to be present in the House when the motion was moved due to an accident, and, in his absence, the motion that Mahon be expelled from the House, 'having by seditious and disloyal utterances been guilty of conduct unfitting to remain a member of this House', was moved. Prime Minister Hughes summed up the government's case against Mahon by saying 'what he has done amounts to treason to Australia and makes him unfit to sit here as a member of the Australian parliament'. The motion was passed with only 25 of Mahon's colleagues dissenting. That ended the parliamentary career of Hugh Mahon, a member democratically elected by his constituents. The motion moved to expel Hugh Mahon did not accuse him of treason; it actually accused him of seditious and disloyal utterances at a public meeting, which amounted to conduct unfitting and inconsistent with the oath of allegiance. Hugh Mahon was never charged with nor tried for treason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege reviewed Mahon's expulsion back in 1984 and concluded that the government majority in the House of Representatives had demonstrably misused its powers. The Mahon family have lived with this injustice for 100 years. I first spoke about Hugh Mahon's expulsion in 2016 in this House. I asked at the time that the House recognise it was unjust and a misuse of power. Not only has there been no recognition of this injustice; in 2018 then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, once a republican, publicly referred to Mahon having been 'convicted of treason'. Now two prime ministers have wrongly stated that Hugh Mahon was guilty of treason—Hughes and Turnbull. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh Mahon's living descendants are understandably upset that not only has this injustice not been redressed by parliament by way of a motion; it has been exacerbated by our 29th Prime Minister. Hugh Mahon's great-grandson Andrew Wilson lives in my electorate of Moreton. I met with Andrew last week and he told me how this continuing injustice has impacted on the Mahon family—Hugh's relatives. They are a proud family, the Mahons, and so they should be. Hugh Mahon was a founding member of the Australian parliament, and two of Mahon's three sons volunteered in the First World War—one as a medical officer and a second as a Lieutenant in the 5th Battalion artillery. He was awarded the Military Cross for heroism near Villiers in France in 1918. Hugh Mahon has three grandchildren who are living, one of them now 94 years old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh Mahon was not disloyal to Australia. He served this nation for 17 years as a member of this House. He was proud of his Irish ancestry, as am I and as are many serving members of this House right now. Hugh Mahon's expulsion was a bare-faced political manoeuvre and injustice writ large. I believe it is important this House recognises, although belatedly, that the expulsion of Hugh Mahon was unjust and a misuse of the power the House possessed at the time of the Eighth Parliament. I fervently hope that members of the 46th Parliament can recognise this injustice and make amends to correct the legacy of one of this parliament's founding members. The Mahon family deserves this.</span>
