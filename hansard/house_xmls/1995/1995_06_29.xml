           Radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings

          The report I have just tabled completes an inquiry by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings into future arrangements for the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The context in which the inquiry has been undertaken includes the relatively poor appreciation the Australian community has of Australia's system of government, the significant investment the parliament has made in the production of broadcast quality radio and television signals of the houses and their committees, the current inadequate coverage of proceedings on the electronic media, and the emergence of new technologies which should enable an enhanced coverage of proceedings.

          With this background in mind, the committee has sought in its report to make recommendations that will give the parliament a better strategic oversight of the future of parliamentary broadcasting and enhance the coverage of proceedings at every opportunity. It is recognised that these strategies may not have an immediate impact. The committee's approach is a long-term one.

          To achieve a better strategic oversight of broadcasting arrangements, the committee recommends that a new act covering parliamentary broadcasting be drafted and introduced into the parliament. The new act would consolidate arrangements for electronic broadcasting of parliament and increase the role of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. In addition to its current role, the joint committee would undertake a more strategic role on behalf of the parliament in advising on arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, regularly reviewing arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, and advising on the application of new technologies to the public dissemination of parliamentary proceedings.

          The committee wishes to see an increase in the radio and television coverage of proceedings. One way to achieve this would be to have a service similar to the C-span type service in the United States established in Australia. Such a service would provide dedicated coverage of parliamentary proceedings. The committee will monitor developments in pay television with a view to obtaining channel capacity for the coverage of parliamentary proceedings at the earliest opportunity. Other approaches recommended by the committee to increase coverage of parliamentary proceedings include encouraging and funding the development of packages of parliamentary material for airing on radio and television, and investigating the provision of the audio and audiovisual feed of proceedings to not-for-profit broadcasters.

       I foreshadowed that I would be moving this motion and the reasons for it yesterday when I think the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) questioned me on what we would be doing for the rest of the day. This motion is made necessary by the fact that the Senate will be considering a range of our legislation and will be wishing to pass some of it back to us no doubt in amended form.

        Whilst I am not necessarily anticipating—particularly if it becomes apparent later in the day that we will be sitting tomorrow—that we will go very late tonight, there is the possibility that we might have to. Hence we need to have this particular standing order suspended. I notice the Manager of Opposition Business looking a bit quizzical on that. We need to check with the Senate constantly to see whether or not it is necessary to have a sitting tomorrow. If it becomes patently obvious that that is the case, then I think it is probably smart to adjourn the House earlier than we might have anticipated tonight rather than try to follow the Senate down to 11 o'clock—which is when it anticipates completing its sitting time tonight. But we need the flexibility anyway. That is why I move the motion.

The only matter which I wish to refer to is this: as we will be here tomorrow, in my view we ought to take the opportunity for a question time. In respect of the second motion which is about to be—

I have not sought that further research because, whatever the precedent is, it seems to me that we are quite capable of making a decision on the merits here and now as suits these particular circumstances. For the sake of completeness, in 1993 there were five extended sitting days—13, 14, 17, 18 and 21 December. On the last three there was no question time but, on the first two—13 and 14 December—there was a question time provided.

I am sure that in the early 1980s we had, as a general rule, a question time on the extra sitting day when that was forced on us by dint of circumstances to complete business, but I do not rest on my own memory.

        I say that we ought to have that question time tomorrow. There is a particular reason for having question time tomorrow. The current account deficit is usually released via the ABS on a Thursday which does give the parliament the opportunity, when it is sitting, to debate its implications for the Australian economy. I do not know why the figure is coming out tomorrow, on Friday, but as we are here and given the expectation that the imports figure will be much higher than had been expected—and that is one component of tomorrow's figures—it seems very odd to me that, on the day an economic indicator of great significance to the country is released, we cannot have some questions put to the government.

        Australia's current account deficit now is worse than Mexico's. It really is reaching crisis proportions. The Australian public, who basically pay for it through higher interest rates on their mortgages, are entitled to know what the government's reaction is. The Labor government has been in office for 12 years. At the next election it will be seeking a mandate from the Australian people to be in office for 19 out of 26 years. That is the request it will be putting to the Australian people. They are entitled to ask, `What have you done? What results have we had in the 16 years you have been in office?'

        When Australia's current account deficit is the highest in the OECD, as predicted by the independent OECD, I think some questions on that subject ought to be answered by the government. It would be nothing but political cowardice for you not to give us question time tomorrow. Now that your sole argument, which is that there is no precedent for question time, has been swept from beneath your feet, I will be very interested to see what your imagination brings forth as the reason why we are not going to have question time tomorrow.

         The existing air traffic control facilities are operationally deficient and were programmed for replacement in the 1994-95 defence medium new works program. During design the project cost estimate has been revised and the project will exceed the medium new works threshold. As a result the project requires parliamentary approval.

          An audit of the air traffic control services at RAAF base Darwin identified that the replacement of radar and communication equipment is crucial to safe air traffic operations at Darwin. The report also concluded that the timing of the construction of the new ATC facilities should be advanced as far as possible to ensure no disruption to the air traffic services whilst allowing the proper introduction of the radar and communications equipment.

          The new equipment will provide the required international standard of air safety at Darwin airport and should not be delayed. To avoid installation delays it is necessary to complete the ATC facilities by the end of 1996. If parliamentary approval is obtained, construction can commence in late 1995 for completion in 1996. In addition, the project will be reprogrammed with a cost cap of $8.4 million. I thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.

          In reviewing the audit report on the new submarine project, the committee has taken a forward looking approach. We have not reviewed in detail the nature of the contract for the construction of the submarines, nor have we commented on the rather colourful debates that took place around the time the audit report was tabled. Instead, we have focused on some of the risks facing the project and have considered whether steps can be taken to improve the management of these risks for the remainder of the submarine project and for future defence projects.

For example, evidence to date indicates that the project office has taken responsible steps to ensure that submarine construction and performance standards will be satisfied. Arguably, these are among the most significant of the risks facing the project.

          However, there are areas where project management improvements can be made.

The committee has made what I believe are a series of constructive recommendations which, if implemented, will help ensure that the submarine project and future defence projects of similar size are managed in an effective and most cost-efficient manner.

          It has been a very interesting exercise to review over recent times the Auditor-General's reports. The Auditor-General plays a very important role in watching the expenditure of public funds throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Some of the reports that come through are fairly standard, basic reports that border on mundane, but others are sizeable and have an enormous impact on the outlays of the Commonwealth.

          One such report was the Auditor-General's report on the submarine project being conducted by the Australian Submarine Corporation. The Auditor-General was not able to dig into the contractual arrangements and see how the contractor was conducting the contract, but he was certainly able to look into how the Department of Defence negotiated the contract and how it was executed. Some concerns about this project were raised in the audit report. Concerns were also raised when the committee took evidence on the subject and visited the ASC plant in Adelaide.

          At the outset, the construction and purchase of six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy represent a significant investment by the government in Australia's defence capability. The project will cost the Commonwealth nearly $5 billion. I think that figure may be closer to $6 billion.

          The government hopes to acquire six state-of-the-art submarines. Its other goals are to achieve the capability in Australian industry to support them for 30 years, to achieve a major transfer of technology to Australian industry, to have local involvement in design construction, to have a major saving in expenditure overseas and to have significant export potential as the only useful submarine builder in the region. They were admirable goals that the government set out when it embarked on this project. That is why the contract that was drafted was unique in comparison to other commercial contracts. That was not only due to its size but also due to the in-built possibility of future benefit for the Commonwealth.

          The jury is still out on that. We will have to wait until the project is completed and see what benefit an Australian company or a partly Australian company gets from what has been developed so far. My personal belief is that not only the Australian National Audit Office but also this parliament, through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, should maintain a watching brief on the project as it progresses towards completion. One of the important recommendations with regard to the ASC in this report is recommendation No. 7, which reads:

That is why that particular recommendation was made.

          I believe the Australian Submarine Corporation was paid too much of the contract price too soon. Some 86 per cent of the contract price had been paid by 31 December 1994. As all members would be aware, to date we have one submarine that is doing sea trials, yet 86 per cent of the contract price has already been paid out.

          The shareholders in ASC have received some fairly healthy dividends. ASC has invested money in a 747, which is on lease to Qantas. On that basis, I believe the Commonwealth is bearing too much of the financial risk associated with this project. There is a bit too much exposure. On that basis, in this report we have suggested that the ANAO should maintain a watching brief. Page 167 reads:

          Given the magnitude of the new submarine project, and the fact that much work remains to be done, it would be appropriate for the Australian National Audit Office to revisit the project at a later date.

In the lifetime of this committee of the parliament we may not see another contract like this.

We found out a day later that he did not turn up because he had left the Australian Submarine Corporation. Many questions surrounding that surprise resignation of the ASC's chief executive were left unanswered. It raises the question: did he have concerns about the way the contract was being managed? It would be interesting to know what those concerns may have been. Was the ASC becoming too competitive in the Asia-Pacific region for its parent company, Kockums, in Sweden?

As the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley, just said, the new submarine project makes up only a quarter of this particular report, but it is a very important element because it contains nearly $6 billion worth of expenditure by the Commonwealth. As I said, the Australian National Audit Office must continue a watching brief on that project. I believe the Joint Committee of Public Accounts should also maintain a watching brief on that project until its completion.

          My introduction to the activities of the Public Accounts Committee was back in 1982, 1983 and 1984 when the PAC was conducting an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. That is why I was quite distressed initially to hear some of the comments in this Auditor-General's report. The report refers to the fact that in the mid-80s the Public Accounts Committee issued a number of reports dealing with fraud and overservicing by medical practitioners and they revealed a number of problems which affected the Commonwealth health budget. The report states:
         </tab>

         At that time, the extent of fraud and overservicing was estimated by the then Department of Health to be `. . . at least 7% of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds'. This figure 7% represented $100m in the 1981/82 financial year . . .

         Since the JCPA hearings on fraud and overservicing in the early to middle 1980s, with the exception of the last 12 months or so, there has been little if any improvement in combating fraud and overservicing.

         Clearly this is a serious issue. If you base that seven per cent figure on annual Medicare benefit schedule expenditure figures in the 1990s, you are looking at something between $300 million and $400 million a year in potential abuse. The report says, and I actually have no reason to doubt what the report says, that there is no evidence that that has improved.

          Since the Public Accounts Committee took some interest in this report, we did have the Health Insurance Commission at a public hearing at which we asked a lot of questions.

         They are fairly obvious recommendations to make, but they are fairly important ones. The year of 1985 came after a fairly difficult period—the introduction of Medicare and a fairly turbulent period in relationships between the Commonwealth government and the AMA. The AMA, of course, changed its position a bit after Medicare came in and after a change of government. It changed its attitude towards the issues of fraud and overservicing and other issues to do with Medicare.

          It was an interesting period. We had a doctors dispute in New South Wales and major problems to overcome. One of the ways in which the government sought to overcome them was to transfer the responsibility for combating fraud and overservicing from the health department to the Health Insurance Commission. The Health Insurance Commission was given a specific mandate in 1985 to carry that out. That is why it was of particular concern that in 1992 an Auditor-General's report should say the things I quoted before—basically, that there has been no improvement.

          In fairness to the Health Insurance Commission, I think it is fair to say that the legislation it has had to work with—the legislation the department of health previously had to work with—going back 20 years, was not really strong enough  to enable federal agencies to effectively police or combat the abuses of the Medicare schedule or the payment of Medicare benefits. That is why I am quite pleased that the government has passed at least two relevant pieces of legislation in this term of parliament—the Professional Services Review Act 1993 and the Powers of Investigation Act 1994. There have been subsequent amendments to those acts. I am confident that both of those pieces of legislation are the best attempts yet in terms of legislation to overcome this problem, which is a major drain on the federal budget.

          I have always supported Medicare. It is the finest health insurance system we have ever had in Australia and it is one of the best in the world. But, of course, it does cost money. Any responsible government, or any politically sensible government, will do whatever it can to ensure that those costs are reduced while not impeding the access and equity to medical services for all Australians. To do that, we have to ensure that the best possible attempt is made to stop abuses by professionals, by medical practitioners or specialists, of the Medicare system.

        —When I was interrupted last night because of the adjournment debate, I was remarking that the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) in his motion before the House had acknowledged that the new work opportunities program is a key element in ensuring that the job compact can be delivered to all eligible job seekers, particularly if they live in areas where employment opportunities are limited. As the government's Working Nation paper points out, there is no doubt that the new work opportunities program will also be the most appropriate employment option to meet the needs of some job seekers.

        A crucial part of the job compact is the facility for the new work opportunities program to accommodate the concerns, needs and initiatives of local communities. It is very important that the program be regionally organised and managed. This provides an opportunity for local communities to assist the unemployed and for unemployed people to contribute to their communities, as well as business and community organisations.

        There is certainly scope for innovation and flexibility in project design. New work opportunities proposals have also been developed at the national level. These proposals will include jobs to reverse environmental degradation along the lines proposed by Greening Australia, jobs in human services such as personal care of the aged and work based assistance to people with a disability, and jobs as literacy education officers in primary schools.

        On this latter matter, I had the privilege several weeks ago to launch the first proposal for literacy education officers in South Australia at the South Australian Institute of Teachers. Trainees for literacy education officers, who were previously unemployed persons, have been allocated to specific primary schools, several of which are in my electorate of Port Adelaide.

        It is important that these literacy officers be recognised. One of the great problems with unemployment is the lack of literacy and numeracy skills among some job seekers. Obviously, a child who lacks literacy and numeracy skills grows up to be an adult. Those problems first arise in primary schools. Hopefully, literacy education officers can play some part in addressing those issues for children who have those problems. New work opportunities projects also include specific provision for people with a disability and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, particularly in rural and very remote communities.

        In the few minutes remaining, I will briefly refer to the Accord as it relates to the labour market. As both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, have pointed out, the Accord is much more than a labour market instrument; it is also an agent for industrial progress and a vital element of trade policy. The partners of the Accord are committed to both growth and employment as the prime objective of economic policy. The Accord has always been about wage constraint for employment and its success is reflected in two very telling statistics: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income—20 per cent in per capita terms—since 1983.

        One of the Accord's visions identifies the essential role of training to underwrite long-term competitiveness in addition to improving the life chances of the disadvantaged. But it importantly recognises that skill formation encourages the adoption and the adaptation of new processes and equipment, and is a principal agent of technical change, which is, in turn, a principal agent of productivity on which the nation's prosperity depends. The partners in the Accord believe unemployment represents our greatest social challenge and it is a matter of great satisfaction that the partners in the Accord have met each unemployment goal—and in this period met it nearly a year early with the addition so far of more than 600,000 jobs.

        In conclusion, I again congratulate the member for Lyne, supported by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), for bringing on this debate. It is a bit of a pity that, during their contributions, they both resorted to making negative comments like so many of their colleagues when it comes to employment, education and training matters. Nevertheless, I wish his Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee every success in its 1,000 jobs campaign. Like our campaign in Port Adelaide, I am sure that—with goodwill, with business and with community organisations, along with the members involved—they will achieve their laudable goals.

        By the actions of the member for Lyne and of the member for Cowper prior to framing that motion, both members acknowledge that the initiatives of the government's Working Nation programs are working. There is no doubt about that: you could not frame that motion unless you believed that. Importantly, Working Nation is growing in momentum not only in Australia's cities but also in important areas in regional Australia. It is, of course, a great pity that the bulk of the opposition front bench does not share this important national interest issue as do all government members and, I suspect, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper.

        It used to be that once you had received your education you got employment. Today, there seems to be a great muddle. I think this reflects a lot on the education, the standards and the manner in which education is undertaken in Australia today. The two members have been able to secure the funds. Recognising that they are members of the opposition, I believe this demonstrates that they are prepared to give programs initiated by the government a chance.

The program allows for local involvement. It is always important for governments to understand that, by giving money, they can remove a problem. They cannot do that unless they have local involvement. I believe that partnership is absolutely essential. The credits that both the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper paid for that local involvement were to the people who have looked at it and made submissions with their assistance. I think it reflects creditably on the local population. Perhaps we ought to see more of this around Australia where local people are prepared to be involved.

If the tourism part of this package gels, the lasting effect will be that people will continue to visit that area and come in and out of the area. Some people, in economic terms, do not understand that if a project is successful there is a multiplier effect.

I understand that the program comprises educational training for six weeks out of the whole 26 weeks and the rest of the time is taken up in on-the-job training. As has been said in this debate, it has been acknowledged that, at the end of the 26 weeks, seven out of 10 people will still be unemployed. They will not be long-term unemployed; they will be short-term unemployed. However, we should look at the positive side.

        It has been mentioned that any program the government implements to absorb the unemployed has to have guidelines. There is no doubt that guidelines for past programs have been and guidelines for this program are unnecessarily restrictive and probably deny another sector of the unemployed—those who have been unemployed for less than 18 months—an opportunity to get a job even though they might have the skills for it. So, if we look at the class of participants who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, we find that it is restricted. The program does not allow for appropriate skills to be applied to the tasks that could be involved, and for that reason it is a waste—although we do recognise it as a training program. I understand that, of the 11,700 places that were to be filled nationally by this program, only 8,000 have been filled.

With Australia as young and as vigorous as it is and with as much opportunity it possesses, the most frightful statistic we have is the underutilisation of our labour resource.

        From speaking to a lot of people in the education area, I know that, in relation to retention levels at school, a lot of youngsters come back to do years 11 and 12 because there is no other outlet for them. Some of them are proving to be a disruptive element for the other students in the broad spectrum of education. I come back to the point that we seem to be looking at this back to front. We should be looking at an education program where we try to teach the skills in the schools, and then after the students have finished university or other education we need to make sure there are jobs available for them to be placed in. I believe the real extent of unemployment and where the real jobs can be provided are being masked. The necessary fundamentals are not yet in place.

        I would like to address my remarks to where real jobs, real labour, can be provided: small business. There are many impediments to small business. At a time of a state election in Queensland, it is not uncommon to see small businesses in my area closed. They are closed because of government impositions. For instance, the difficulty employers have today in terminating employment makes them think twice about putting on people. The state's payroll tax has long been acknowledged as an impediment to employment. The super guarantee levy and the fringe benefits tax are add-ons to the impositions on small business to employ. Small businesses have recognised there are many impediments to employing labour, such as high taxes, and they are not employing.

        One other definite impediment to small business in Queensland providing employment will be the deregulation of shopping hours. It will cause all the little grocery stores and service stores on corners to collapse and allow big international supermarkets to blossom. They will not be good employers.

In that regard, I do not think the federal government, or the Queensland government, can claim any credit for creating jobs.

Just think of the job opportunities going to waste. No new dams have been constructed. No programs have been put in place except the user-pays system. Again, these are areas that could provide real labour. No more roads will be built at the public's expense. Roads are now being built in the form of tollways.

We have just completed an exercise in the banking, finance and public administration committee looking at the aspects of taxation on the tourism industry that put it at a disadvantage compared with other industries. The user-pays principle that is now coming into tourism, whether it be in regard to the use of the Barrier Reef, the use of a national park or the use of a waterway, is decimating the tourism industry. The government says that it is not putting up or introducing new taxes but there has been an abnormal increase in the aspect of how it funds its money. This is just one way. In regard to fuel tax excise the industry complains bitterly that it is not subject to a rebate because all the fuel it uses on the water is never used on a road back on the mainland.

        —I would like to answer a couple of things that the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) had to say. The difference between each side of the House can come up in these debates. The term the honourable member used was the `under-resource of our labour force', which is true. On our side of the House we believe that with unemployment comes a great deal of social cost as well. High levels of unemployment disrupt our society greatly and cause great hardship to individuals. I guess that is why the long-term unemployed have been targeted for special assistance with some of the programs this motion deals with.

        The member for Dawson raised the issue of retention rates. He was missing the point. When we look at retention rates and young people staying at school and endeavouring to gain skills at that level, we find that many of the jobs that the previous generation would have been engaged in have now gone. The jobs are not there. So the best thing those young people can do is to gain further skills to enhance their entry into some of the jobs that are coming on, which require many more skills than probably a 15- or a 16-year-old would have required even in my day and even in your day, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those jobs have gone, so it is not a simple task to say that there should be another system and that those kids should not be at school, that they should be out there working. The jobs that they used to take up are not there any longer.

        If you look deeper into some of the programs that are starting to come into play and some of the policies of this government to encourage school-to-work programs, then I think the honourable member would probably reach a different conclusion. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) moved this motion yesterday in the House. He talked about new work opportunities. He had some criticisms of the programs and  labour market programs generally, but I felt he was missing the point with his criticism that we were targeting the long-term unemployed people who had been out of work for 18 months. The old argument of why we are doing that comes from statistics that show that after each recession or downturn in our economy we pick up people who have been out of work for a longer period.

        The recent downturn that we have had caused a high number of people to be out of work for a long period. The problem is that, if you do not get back into the work force in the early months of unemployment, you find it even harder to get back in after you have been out of work for 18 months. Employers do not pick up people who have been out of work for 12 months or more unless those people have a special skill. Employers will pick up somebody who has been out of work for two or three months in front of somebody who has been out of work for 18 months. The government's employment policy is targeted at assisting those people who have been out of work for a long period.

        The honourable member for Lyne talked about whether the employment programs were successful. In Tasmania, 38 per cent of our labour programs resulted in people getting into work. I think that is an excellent statistic, although it could be better. The programs could work towards getting more people into work—and of course they are doing that. They also get people into the working mode by giving them a six-month opportunity to get back into a job or to get a job for the first time. It enables them to get a pay packet, get into the regular habit of going to and from work and take part in the socialisation associated with that sort of activity.

        If the program had not been instigated in Tasmania, we would have had no growth in employment. These improvements have occurred in what is still a very difficult labour market, which shows that Working Nation is on track and ahead of schedule in some parts of the state. We have a state government which has not been able to boost job growth at all. All employment has been created by one or another of the federal government programs and can be attributed to the Working Nation initiative. No investment is coming into the state. Our tourist figures are down, and no jobs are being created through the policies of our state government.

There were a few problems with this, and I think it was caused by the lack of information given to participants when they started. We have now sorted that out. I am sure it will be a very successful program.

        I had a member of my staff contact the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I gave him no guidance, so he went through a slightly tortuous process of identifying the right person. I just told him the sort of information I needed. He was referred to the regional office in control of the Gold Coast, which is at Mount Gravatt. When he contacted that DEET office he was told that the person who was responsible for that area was on the telephone and unavailable. He explained that he was seeking general background information and requested, of the staff member he spoke to, the following information, which is what I had requested: how many new work opportunities programs are operating on the Gold Coast—by that I also meant any plans that might be in hand—what industries are involved and how many people are currently, or will be, taking advantage of this scheme?

        Later, my staff member spoke to the DEET office at Southport. Southport is the centre of my electorate and it is also where my electorate office is located.

I therefore have a longstanding working relationship with federal government department agencies which are located on the Gold Coast—and most of them happen to be in Southport. There has never been any problem between me and my office and any government office within my electorate or anywhere else.

She contacted my office shortly after 5 o'clock to say that she could not supply any information without the authority of the area office and that she would attempt to get someone to telephone me with the information required. It would seem that when the people who had the information came out of their office, they told her that this information could not be supplied to me by this office.

        Yesterday I put my name on the speakers list for this item, hoping to talk about what is happening with taxpayers' money under government programs in my electorate, and I come almost empty-handed. Someone may ask: why did I not contact the chairman of the consultative committee? The chairman of the consultative committee from my region is a person called Peter Lawlor. I have known Peter Lawlor for about as long as I have been the member for Moncrieff. I have been in the electorate for 11 years and I have been the member nearly that long. I have no problems with him—he is a very pleasant fellow and we get on very well. However, he is the Labor candidate for Southport in the forthcoming state election. He is not a businessman—although I suppose he is in a certain sense—he is a solicitor, but he is not the sort of person that I would have expected to be chairing the consultative committee on the Gold Coast.

        Some people may be aware that the Gold Coast is the small business capital of Australia. If you look at all the statistics on employment, self-employment and so on from the Bureau of Statistics, you will find that the electorates of McPherson and Moncrieff have the highest number of self-employed people, or of people employed by a very small enterprise, of all the electorates in Australia.

        So when I make the claim we are the small business capital of Australia I do not do so lightly. It is an area of entrepreneurship. It is at the cutting edge of the Australian economy. Tourism, which is our major industry, is a small business industry. There are few large businesses. People tend to look at enterprises like Conrad International Hotel and Jupiters Casino, see that it is a fairly substantial employer and think that it is typical of the Gold Coast. Those sorts of concerns are absolutely atypical of the Gold Coast. We are a small business economy.

For example, the member for Lyne, who raised this matter, mentioned in his speech that the chairman of his committee is a proprietor of McDonald's Family Restaurants in Taree and Port Macquarie. We have some very successful franchises of McDonald's restaurants on the Gold Coast. There are quite a few of them on the Gold Coast and some people have more than one McDonald's restaurant.

He would probably have a pretty broad experience, although I do not know what his experience of business is.

        I think members will understand that in an election climate I had some diffidence about contacting a Labor candidate. Peter Lawlor has been the Labor candidate for quite some months, since Christmas in fact. At the moment he is campaigning very hard to defeat a coalition member of the state parliament, Mr Mick Veivers, who is the shadow minister for tourism—and a very good, hardworking member he has been, too. In that climate alone, it is difficult for me to be contacting him. I say that by way of some explanation. I also wonder whether someone who is a candidate for an election at the time of his appointment—as far as I know—as chairman was the appropriate person for the minister to put in this position.

        —We are here today to debate a motion moved by the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), sponsored also by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), on one of the programs under the Working Nation initiative: new work opportunities and use of the area consultative committee process in the mid-coast area. It is also an opportunity to discuss in general, as many speakers have, the question of the operation of Working Nation and the question of, I suppose, the development of initiatives on behalf of government to assist with the question of unemployment, with what can be done from a government perspective.

        The role of government in a practical sense has changed significantly in the last 15 years in relation to job creation. Historically, job creation from government usually meant major public works or increased public sector employment through existing departmental channels. The attempts at assisting private sector employment through government programs were minimal and often inappropriate. As a response to the recession of the early 1980s and the continuing above average levels of unemployment that followed during the recovery—that is, above average given our postwar experience of the 1950s and 1960s—the government started to develop a range of programs and subsidy arrangements to assist people to gain skills and to assist business to employ.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The success of these initiatives was mixed for a range of reasons. Firstly, the implementation of some programs proved to be extremely costly, making the unit costs prohibitive. Departmental structures and personnel were often not well equipped to handle problems dealing with long-term unemployed people or with the private sector that would be employing them.

        The Department of Employment, Education and Training and its forerunners were never really designed for the task they have faced over the last 15 years. The massive increase in unemployment levels led to increased resourcing for the department, but real difficulties have continued with respect to having the right structure to respond to the challenges faced, the ability to react quickly and with innovation to changing demands, and getting enough of the right sort of staff to perform the various roles required. For example, working with small business people and convincing them of the scope available for assistance via government programs is not a role many public servants would be comfortable with. Administrative competence comes secondary to role of advocate and salesperson on these occasions.

        The private sector also had a general suspicion of government. By that I mean that many business people, particularly in small business, were unwilling to believe that the government could actually be there to help them. Visions of bureaucracy, red tape and armies of clerks and accountants were difficult to overcome in terms of convincing employers that real practical assistance was available.

        Some programs just were not successful or, rather, not as successful as was hoped when dealing with diverse areas of labour market demand, both in terms of the opportunity for sustainable employment growth and also regarding the skills required. Government has found it difficult to accurately predict and anticipate regional needs and provide appropriate program delivery. The role and interaction between the three levels of government have also been problematic with respect to some programs. Parochialism and political partisanship have at times hampered practical policy outcomes.

        Most of these difficulties can also be related to the problem of developing policy nationally for implementation locally. By that I mean that any employment generation policy that seeks to practically influence diverse local labour markets has to be able to not only appeal to the vagaries of a particular area but also understand the psychology of the various players involved; for example, prospective employers, the unemployed and the various bureaucrats at state, federal and local level.

        The 1980s and early 1990s have seen various initiatives being tried with some being discarded and others refined. The government's white paper, Working Nation, essentially builds on the experience of the last few years. In terms of labour market programs and the role they can play in job creation, the emphasis is on subsidy support for employers to employ. This occurs via traineeships with the continuation of jobstart and also under the job compact with the new work opportunities program. The nature of these programs is to encourage employers to employ, to give them an opportunity to turn a marginal job opportunity into an ongoing position via government subsidy. The subsidy provided assists while a new employee is being trained and helps minimise the economic cost to business of employing new staff.

        The emphasis on improved training programs and practical on-the-job training seeks to ensure potential employees have relevant skills in terms of labour market opportunities that are available. This has always been the aim with training programs. However, with better business links, improved coordination, greater flexibility around what courses are available—when they are available—and how quickly they can be developed, better outcomes are expected.

        One of the most important themes in Working Nation in terms of its practical initiatives is its localism. By that, I mean the consistent approach of trying to structurally address the difficulties faced by national policy being implemented at the local level. For an employment generation policy to be successful, it has to be adaptable to local circumstances and be capable of implementation by those responsible. The government is doing this in a number of ways.

        Firstly, the government is doing this through the co-option of industry and union representation at all levels. This occurs through national bodies, such as NETTFORCE; through industry related activities, such as industry training boards; and at a local level, via DEET area consultative committees and the boards of regional development organisations. The intention is to ensure that initiatives are implemented with broad support because there is broad agreement on their appropriateness. This will help to make sure that initiatives are successful and, hopefully, undermine the suspicion of government's role at the local level.

        Attempts are also being made to improve the service delivery options available to government. The CES is being revamped, with an increased emphasis on outcomes through the individual case management approach for the unemployed. This should help ensure unemployed people get better, more effective advice and assistance with respect to appropriate training and job opportunities. In addition, private sector providers are also being introduced to provide case management services. This will provide an alternative to the CES and is already placing pressure on CES staff to improve their game. Area consultative committees should also assist CES management to be better in touch with the needs of the area they serve.

        One initiative that I believe could be very successful is the use of CES officers to lobby local employers to put people on. Although the CES currently has business service centres whose role is to perform this task, they tend to concentrate on larger employers. By dedicating staff to knock on doors and convince employers that they can afford to employ someone, I am confident that many small employers can be convinced, and the net increase in employment could be significant.

        The success of the strategy I have briefly outlined is difficult to quantify accurately, but the available information is encouraging. For example, the success of NEIS is demonstrated by the fact that 84 per cent of NEIS participants are still in employment 15 months after starting their NEIS businesses. NEIS businesses also create jobs by employing additional people. For those on traineeships, the retention rate in unsubsidised employment is 84 per cent some three months after the subsidy period is completed.

        It is also possible to compare the success of labour market programs for participants with the circumstances faced by those who have not taken part in any program. Evaluations of jobstart, job clubs, jobtrain and skillshare, which accounted for about 75 per cent of all labour market program commencements in 1994, showed that they greatly improve the chances of getting a job. Participation in a training program increased the likelihood of getting a job by 50 per cent, while participation in a wage subsidy program doubled the chance of getting a job.

        Importantly, the programs have had an even greater impact on the job prospects of the long-term unemployed. For example, for jobstart people who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months, there was a 60 per cent outcome rate; but for people not in jobstart who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months there was only a 27 per cent outcome rate. Preliminary data on former jobstart participants shows that outcome levels for the long-term unemployed are sustained for at least a year after program participation. However, I believe that the development of a comprehensive and effective system is an ongoing process—and that process is continuing.

        The government's overall target in Working Nation is to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. We still have a long way to go. As someone who has been unemployed in years gone by, during the last recession, I know that it is difficult for people who are in that situation to see that there is a chance in the future. Since the release of Working Nation we have seen the rate of unemployment drop from a peak of 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent.

        You also have to look at what Working Nation is about and what the role of area consultative committees is. It is a question  not only of generating employment but also of ensuring that we do not have a situation that occurred in previous recessions where the long-term unemployed were left behind. If you look at the last recession and the recovery that came after that, you will see that with employment growth there was minor impact on the number of long-term unemployed. If, say, 430,000 people went back into employment, only 10,000 or 12,000 were long-term unemployed, because they were left behind. The circumstances resulting from this recovery are very different. Now about 25 per cent of the new jobs created have gone to the long-term unemployed. That is a major endorsement of the rationale and the strategy behind this program.

        When we are debating this issue we also have to look at the coalition's record in these circumstances. The recent headland speech from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made no mention of employment, education and training. Even The Things That Matter farce that occurred some months ago had a whole chapter devoted to that, but it has now dropped off the agenda. In the last two years, we have created over 600,000 new jobs through the government's policies and through the overall economic recovery. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in the coalition government, the record was 262,000 jobs created in 5 1/2 years.

We have had four per cent productivity improvement in the labour force, while the best the coalition achieved when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 1 1/2 per cent. There are clear differences there for all to see. Although it is some years ago—and that is often the point made by the opposition—the fact is that it is the only record we have on which to judge the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, because for so many years he has been isolated from real power, even within his own party.

        On the question of area consultative committees, we are also talking about the issue of regional development—that localism that I mentioned earlier—how you develop a real local identity, process and energy to develop agreements on a local basis. Yesterday the member for Page talked about the memo that was produced by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) on the question of regional and rural development. It was very insightful of the actual process being followed by the coalition. He talked about the need to have big figures and the need to try to set an agenda which was based on statements rather than on action. He stressed the fact that, after an election, one can always back away from it. The government's policies have been endorsed by the OECD. The minister has spoken about that on a regular basis. The situation we have here is that we are doing something. It is working and it should be commended by the House.

         The Prime Minister's statement outlined his republican agenda. He tried to give the impression that his statement was based on the recommendations of the very expensive Republic Advisory Committee, but the speech we heard from the Prime Minister was his republican agenda, and his alone. In April 1993, the government established a Republic Advisory Committee headed by Malcolm Turnbull. It was made up of an elite group chosen by the Prime Minister and, I should add, it was a group certainly not representative of mainstream Australia.

         It is ironic that, when the Leader of the Opposition announced that the coalition would allow the Australian people to be involved in the process of constitutional reform and that we would hold a people's convention—the make-up of which would be 50 per cent appointed and 50 per cent elected, and 10 per cent of those appointed would be in the age bracket of 18 to 25—the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) questioned the fact that we would appoint half the membership. He questioned the fact that half the people's convention would be appointed; yet the Prime Minister's advisory committee was 100 per cent appointed, unrepresentative of mainstream Australia and lacking in representation of young people.

Hundreds of thousands of dollars were expended by the government on the Keating committee, and there is little evidence from the Prime Minister's statement of him taking note of their recommendations. For all we know, the statement could have been prepared before the committee commenced any deliberations but only made by the Prime Minister afterwards.

First, the member for Stirling, like all of his coalition colleagues, keeps trying to avoid the fundamental question—a question that has been asked of those opposite for quite a while now and which the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has failed to answer and continues to fail to answer: does the coalition believe that an Australian should be our head of state? That is the question opposition members must answer.

         The fact is that we on this side of the House do believe that. We believe that an Australian should be our head of state, that we are an independent nation entitled to have our own head of state from our own people. That has been the essence of the debate on the republic since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) first raised the issue in 1991, and that is the question the coalition continues to refuse to answer. No amount of obfuscation, delaying tactics and avoidance rhetoric by the member for Stirling, the Leader of the Opposition or any of their colleagues on the opposition benches will hide the fact that the people of Australia are asking for an answer to that fundamental question.

         The attempt to hide from the question by saying that Australia has been selecting its own governors-general for the last 30 or 40 years and that they have been Australians—most of them have been outstanding Australians and have done the job very well—does not answer the question. The Governor-General is not our head of state; the Governor-General is the representative of our head of state. According to our constitution, the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, and her children and grandchildren will hold the position as our head of state.

         I, as a democrat, believe that we the people should choose our head of state and that no-one should have a right to be our head of state because of the family they were born to or who their parents are. I fundamentally reject the concept of a monarchy because I am a very strong democrat and I believe the people should choose our leader and our head of state. I believe fundamentally that the people of Australia, when they get the opportunity to directly participate by voting in the referendum that will be held in 1998 or 1999, will make that decision as well.

         At the moment, whenever our head of state travels overseas, she travels as the Queen of England. She represents British industry, British commerce, British people's values. She does it very well. She is an outstanding representative for the people of Britain, but she does not represent the people of Australia. When she went to Russia or when she went to Canada or when she went to Europe, she did not go there saying, `I am the Queen of Australia. I am here to tell you that Australian goods and services are great and you should be buying up more of these things and you should come and visit Australia.'

         —When the Governor-General travels overseas, most countries do not understand what his actual status is; they are quite confused about him. Is he the head of state or not the head of state? By our constitution, no, he is not. He is not the head of state. He is the representative of the head of state. It is something of great confusion. You just have to ask the Governor-General yourself and he will tell you that. When the Governor-General has travelled in Asia and in other places around the world they are unsure what his actual status is because he is not really our head of state. He is doing a great job as Governor-General. He is an outstanding Australian and I have the utmost regard for his work and the opportunities that he has advanced for Australia in his work as Governor-General, but he is not there in his own right. He is there as the Queen's representative. So that is the first question that has to be answered by the opposition.

         The Leader of the Opposition has attempted to confuse the question by pulling the stunt which he pulled out of the former opposition leader's bag of tricks called a people's convention. He is saying, `We will have this people's convention and that will be the most democratic way that we can determine the process of reforming our constitution.'

         The Prime Minister is also wrong in his criticism of the origins of the constitution. In July 1993, in his speech to commemorate the centenary of the Corowa conference, the Prime Minister described the constitution as `complex, legalistic and virtually impossible to relate to contemporary Australian life'. This is simply not true. The Australian constitution continues to provide the nation with an effective system of governance—a system that the Australian people are remarkably reluctant to tamper with.

         If there are problems, they result from the inability of politicians to agree on solutions to problems such as the imbalance in revenue raising and spending powers and on where specific functions should lie.

In July 1994, he told a group of school children that the constitution was designed by the British foreign office to look over the Australian government's shoulder. The Prime Minister is not even averse to misleading school children on this issue. What he told them is untrue.

         Eminent constitutional lawyers of the calibre of Sir Robert Garran, H. B. Higgins, Professor Geoffrey Sawer and Professor Colin Howard have raised grave doubts about whether a referendum under section 128 of the constitution can create a republic. The constitution is itself clause 9 of an imperial enactment, the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. While clause 9—that is, the constitution—can be amended by referendum, the other clauses in this act, which envisage the continuation of the monarchy, may not be amenable to amendment in this manner. This includes the preamble to the act, which refers to the agreement of the people of the various colonies to unite in one indissoluble federal Commonwealth under the Crown. In the past, these covering clauses could probably have been amended by an act of the United Kingdom parliament. However, quite properly, this possibility was removed with the passage of the Australia Act in 1986 by the United Kingdom and the federal parliament.

         The effect of this legislation appears to be that all state parliaments will be required to agree with any proposal for a republic. The difficulties of securing this agreement should not be overestimated. Another issue is the possibility that some states might choose to retain their monarchies. Each state has a separate crown, legislature and judiciary. Each state constitution is preserved by section 106 of the Australian constitution. The Australia Act preserves the monarchical system of the states.

         Some state constitutions have provisions designed to make changing them very difficult. For example, Victoria requires an absolute majority in both Houses, Queensland requires a referendum, and Western Australia requires both of these. Under the Prime Minister's preferred model, it is up to each state to decide how it would appoint its head of state. The prospect that Australia might end up a federal republic with one or more of the states continuing links with the monarchy  is not an outcome that would be in the overall interest of the Australian nation. Nevertheless, it is one that the Prime Minister appears comfortable with.

         The Prime Minister has underestimated all of these obstacles to change. He has also taken for granted that, if we were to have a republic, Australians would support his preferred option of parliamentary election of a President. On this, like so many matters relating to the republic, his position is badly flawed. In the latest poll, 74 per cent of Australians support popular election of a head of state, while only 16 per cent support the Keating model.

         Those Australians who are assessing for themselves the merit of Australia moving to a new constitutional framework are affronted at the shallowness and insincerity of many of the Prime Minister's arguments. Quite obviously, much of his rhetoric about the reasons for change are just wrong. The coalition does, however, recognise that many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic—most of them not for the reasons put forward by the Prime Minister. To enable the issue to be addressed by the people for the people, the coalition in government will establish a people's constitutional convention.

         The Prime Minister's first priority in pushing the republican cause is to cement his place in history. However, the partisan and ingenuous way in which he has handled this issue will only cement his reputation as the most divisive Prime Minister in this nation's history. If the Prime Minister were really interested in fostering a national consensus on the question of the republic, he would immediately stop tampering with the symbols of our current system of government. Many of these, while the Labor Party has been in power, have been fiddled with to the direct detriment of this nation.

         —Like the member who preceded me in this debate, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in a debate which will be one of the very significant rungs in the development of Australia's nationhood. At the end of the first century of the six colonies which made up what became known as Australia, those six colonies decided that the time, 1 January 1901, was appropriate for them to join together as the Commonwealth of Australia.

         In the process of Australia developing its national character, its nationhood, Australia continued as a constitutional monarchy with the head of state the Queen of England. Subsequently, as a result of legislative changes, the Queen was identified as also being the Queen of Australia.

         I believe the response on the part of the Australian people is such that there is overwhelming support for the proposition that we use the turn of the next century as a symbolic occasion to add further to the national character of the Australian Commonwealth and determine firmly that Australia, like the overwhelming majority of countries of the world, will have one of its own as its head of state.

         Let me emphasise that, whatever else might be said about this question, there is one core issue which must be addressed and which must be answered. It is central. It is fundamental. That question is this: is Australia sufficiently mature, proud and independent, and does Australia have sufficient sovereignty, self-pride and dignity, to have one of its own as its head of state? Or is Australia to continue, as it has now for over 200 years, as six colonies for the first 110 years, and subsequently as the Commonwealth of Australia, to have as its symbolic head of state a person who belongs to another country?

         That is the simple question. Members of the opposition have not answered that question. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) did not answer that question. Those opposite continue to avoid the question because they know that the sentiment of the Australian people is such that they believe we are sufficiently proud, we are sufficiently developed, we are sufficiently independent and we do have sufficient self-dignity to say that the Australian head of state should be one of our own. It is simply appalling, to my mind, that anyone could ever possibly assert to the contrary.

         I repeat the first question. The core question we must answer is: do we want an Australian as Australia's head of state or are we so fawning as to require a person from another country to be the top symbol of Australia as a nation? Once we have answered that question in the only way we can, the next question automatically falls into place. You cannot have an Australian head of state unless you have an Australian republic. It is as simple as that.

         The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quite correctly said that he and the government would support a minimalist approach. That is the approach we all endorse as well.

         When we refer to that minimalist approach, we mean that the simple change that would be enacted would be that the Governor-General, in effect renamed a president, would replace the monarch as Australia's head of state.

The powers and responsibilities of the head of state would remain exactly the same as they are at the present time.

         There is not even any intention on the part of the government to seek a codification of the reserve powers of the Governor-General. It has been indicated that that attempt will not be made.

         I emphasise a point which has not always been made. Let us be perfectly clear about it. At the present time, the Governor-General is appointed by the Prime Minister—full stop.

         What has the Prime Minister proposed? He has proposed that, instead of one person in Australia appointing what the opposition chooses to call our head of state, the Governor-General, the election of a president will require a two-thirds vote of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate—people who are elected by Australian electors to represent them. That is the essence of the Prime Minister's proposal.

         Obviously, the position is not, as has been suggested, that the power to appoint a president is being grabbed by politicians. In fact, the opportunity for the elected representatives of the people to participate in deciding who that head of state should be is being broadened to require election by two-thirds of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 148 members of this chamber and the 76 members of the Senate would sit together, with at least two-thirds of them being required to vote in support of who was to be president.

         It is obvious that, if we are to have two-thirds of the combined numbers of the national parliament determining who the head of state should be, there would need to be discussions, negotiations and agreement between the opposition and the government. If we have agreement, we have a bipartisan decision—and we would not have a political figure becoming the president of Australia. I know that the opposition would not approve of Gough Whitlam, nor would we approve of Malcolm Fraser. But we might approve of a Ninian Stephen, a Zelman Cowen, a Lois O'Donoghue or a Dick Smith. The head of state would be bipartisan.

         But if the proposal of the opposition were adopted, we would have a vote over the whole of Australia by 11 million people.

But I will tell you what: there will not be a Ninian Stephen or a Zelman Cowen among them, because neither of those two gentlemen would ever have access to the funds that would be necessary to fund a political election campaign across the whole of Australia. But we will nominate our political candidate—let us be perfectly clear about it—and the person who is elected will be a political president. That is precisely what we do not want.

That president would say, `Hey now, listen, you just hold on a minute. I've been elected by 11 million Australians. The Prime Minister has been elected by his colleagues within the parliament and by a maximum of 80,000 people within his own electorate.' The president would say to the Prime Minister, `My mandate is a national mandate; yours is a single electoral mandate. Don't you tell me that I have no powers. My authority rests with the nation.'

         He also said that, once that convention considers all of the issues, if there is consensus, if there is general agreement, that a republic should be established, he would be prepared to pursue that.

So he would appoint 50 per cent of the convention and the other 50 per cent of the convention would be elected. He would control it absolutely—and he still says, `Unless there is 60 per cent supporting the proposition for a referendum, we would not proceed with it.'

It can examine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. It can examine the question of whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms for the federal parliament. It can examine the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation.

         May I make a couple of observations about the so-called republican debate. Republicanism in its latin usage means the public thing. In the final analysis, there is not a great deal of difference or, for that matter, a great deal of effect being proposed by either side in the republican debate, because the real nub of the dilemma facing Australians in their political system in the 1990s is the domination of the parliament of the people by the executive.

         It is my view that all of the issues that have been raised in the republican debate—the consequences, et cetera—ought to be put back within the confines of that important debate; that is, the struggle of the Australian people to become sovereign again in their own nation. Quite clearly, as we have seen the development of the Australian model of the Westminster system, we have seen, particularly over more recent years, the extraordinary domination of the political system by the executive, to such an extent that the Prime Minister or the state premiers have all the powers to rival medieval princes in their standing vis-a-vis the parliament and other facets of our political democratic system.

         It is important to bring the whole debate back into that context, because not to do so is to betray the interests of the very people to which we are referring—the Australian people—and their rights, responsibilities and duties as Australian citizens. It is also important to reflect that many of Australia's institutions are already essentially republican institutions. The debate revolves around the question of whether the head of a state should be a constitutional monarch—in our case, the Queen of Australia and her vice-regal representative, the Governor-General.

         The people of Australia are not going to get much out of this at all because, in essence, there will be no change to the essential relationship between executive power and the people of Australia. In other words, the people of Australia will continue to become more and more oppressed in that relationship to such an extent—as we know within this particular chamber—that, as much as we care to debate about the issues of the day affecting our nation, at the end of the day the real decisions are made in executive cabinet. The decisions can be made at the whim of the Prime Minister who enjoys the majority of support within that cabinet room. That makes debate in this chamber less and less relevant to the decision making process.

In a way, their relationship with executive power is less definable but, at the conclusion of the Prime Minister's proposal, it is probably no different from the situation in which they find themselves right at this moment.

Nearly a billion dollars of taxpayers' funds were lost on extraordinary and mainly secret business deals involving donors to the Labor Party. Parliament was never informed of the truth; decisions were made on the run and in concert with conclaves of favoured business people at late-night meetings in private offices and homes; cabinet documents were altered; crucial departmental files either disappeared or were shredded.

I ask honourable members: at a time when one of the oldest republics in the modern political world—the republic of France—is thumbing its nose at the views of Australia and treating Australia in a very offhand and dismissive manner, did President Chirac for one minute consider the proposal by the Prime Minister and allow that to alter his point of view? Of course not. It made no difference whatsoever, and neither will it.

         Much of the talk about somehow increasing Australia's standing by becoming a republic is not only irrelevant but also ludicrous. That sort of talk is patently absurd, particularly when the Prime Minister talks about improving our standing in Asia when we know that many of our surrounding nations have monarchs as their heads of state. I suppose they must look in wonder and bewilderment when the Prime Minister uses overseas trips in order to publicly criticise Australia's institutions—in countries which may well respect the institutions he is dismissing as irrelevant or out of date.

         Changes need to be made to our system to make it a more democratic and responsive system. At this stage, I wholeheartedly support the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for a people's convention. But this ought not to be merely a people's convention to determine who ought to be the head of state. This must be a people's convention to look at the fundamental ways in which we can make the Australian people more powerful in their own political system.

As we know, political parties were not mentioned in the Australian constitution when it was written. However, in the evolution of the Australian parliamentary system since the constitution, we have seen the political party system become more and more entrenched within our political processes.

         There are some advantages to that—and I have no doubts about that—but there are some substantial disadvantages.

The people's interests lay in having political parties that are democratic, constitutionally run—not illegally run—and in a way that allows full participation in the policy making process and, in particular, the most relevant to the processes of parliament, in the selection of candidates.

In overall terms, looking at the large picture, the Westminster system has provided Australia with a stable, democratic, essentially decent and civilised society. That is a good thing. Winston Churchill once spoke of the British system. He said that it was the worst system in the world apart from all others. That was a very telling description. It means there are a number of faults and a number of things need to be changed but, at the end of the day, it is a system that outranks and beats most of its competition around the world.

Indeed, I am a frequent visitor to Britain—although, I must say, to enter Britain now I must go through the gate marked `aliens'.

         The government on 28 April 1993 established a people's advisory committee to prepare an options paper which would set the minimum changes required to create a republic. Since that committee reported to the government, the republic has been widely debated and discussed in the media, in this place, in schools, in universities and in various community groups. All Australians are being exposed to this debate. In the process many Australians believe that the time is right for Australia to become a republic.

         There is some debate about how the head of state should be elected. I favour election by parliament, but I can see merit on both sides. I can see the merit of the president being elected by the people like, say, the Irish President and the French President, and I can see the merit of the president being elected by the parliament. So I am not going to the wall over this one. But I do think that, if we are going to have a non-political person in that office, it is inevitable that he or she be elected by the parliament, because once there is a campaign, as we saw in the recent French election campaign, the president becomes a very political person—and it is a political act electing that person. We as members of parliament are elected by the people. I think that a president who is elected by the parliament would be elected with the agreement of both sides of the parliament. As with the appointment of governors-general, it takes that political aspect away from the role of the president. If we want people in that position who command the respect of the majority of the population, I believe that it is only by having them chosen by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of the two chambers that we will get that.

I cannot for the life of me see how a constitutional convention of 200 elected people and 200 appointed people can be seen to be reflective of the Australian point of view. The 200 appointed people would obviously be reflective of whoever appoints them. The real difficulty that the opposition has in this whole debate is that fundamentally it does not believe that an Australian should be this country's head of state. I know there is some division there, but in the main its problem is that it does not believe in an Australian occupying that position. Australia is making its way in this complex world.

         —The question of an Australian republic is not something that is new on the agenda. It has been around since the time that Federation itself was considered. It has been to date a concept which has been rejected on a basis of argument that has been both logical and sensible. From my own point of view, I have always asked two questions of those who would bring about change to achieve the end that they desire. The first is: what is the nature of the change that those people who propose it wish to have? The second is: how will that make Australia a better place? From my own perspective, I have heard no sensible answer to the second question, and only recently have we heard from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) an answer to the first. Having heard his answer to the first, I am still of the opinion that our present system serves us very well.

         The proposal that has come forward starts from a premise which is fundamentally flawed. The opening premise is that a very small change—a minimalist change—can be made and nothing else will change. The system will continue to function as it is. That is a flawed proposition. It will be argued that there can be an election by the parliament: that is, a collegiate election of a head of state and that this person somehow remains above the political process. Nonsense. Once that person is elected—it does not matter whether the election is by collegiate system, as in the United States of America where the president is elected by a college of votes, or whether the head of state is elected by the people in a plebiscite—the bottom line is that the head of state is an elected person, and an elected person always has a mandate.

         Under our current system, appointment by Her Majesty the Queen is the method by which we select a head of state who is truly above politics. Very simply, the Prime Minister of the day selects an individual and makes a recommendation to the Queen. That nomination may be rejected—convention has it that it is not—and the appointment is duly made. Bill Hayden, when he was appointed to the position, acted up until that moment entirely as a political person. After he was appointed to the position he has behaved, as have all governors-general, in an apolitical way and has carried out the responsibilities in a non-political way.

         The other day, when the Governor-General chose to speak his mind on a number of subjects, his remarks were of interest for people to read, but they had no political clout because he is a man without a mandate. Had the same person been an elected president and made that speech, it would become politically relevant.

         The difference is quite substantial. To say that there can be a minimalist change and that all things will continue on as they are is like saying that you can be a little bit pregnant. You cannot—things flow from the change. If the time comes that there is ever to be an elected president, my view is that the people should do the electing. That is the view that the rest of Australia seems to have—if the polls are any guide. Although I do recall that in 1988 we were faced with a referendum to change the constitution and in the opinion polls, about 80 per cent of people said, `Yes, this change is excellent and we must have it,' but once we got into the detail of it and what it was really entailing not one single state passed the referendums.

         It is important that we look at the detail and what is really involved. Let us suppose that the people had their way. If there were to be a change and a president were to be elected by the people, what would flow from that? Currently, we operate under what we call the Westminster system, although I suggest that under the current government we do not. Under this government we see instances where ministers who have been found wanting and in error have refused to resign until they are virtually forced from office—for example, Mrs Kelly over sports rorts or Graham Richardson over the infamous Marshall Islands affair. There have been many instances where people have not behaved in accordance with the Westminster principle.

         Under the Westminster principle we should have an apolitical Public Service; that is, a public service which merely serves the government of the day to the best of its ability with the best research and effort that is possible. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case either. Although there are first-class, splendid public servants who wish to perform in that way, through the influence of the current government we have public servants in senior positions who are very political in the way they behave.

         So we look at what is an alternative to a Westminster system should we have an elected president. One model we can look at is the congressional system in the United States. There it has a true doctrine of the separation of powers, not as we have here. Here, although we have the judiciary separate from the legislature and the executive, we do not separate the executive and the legislature. Our ministers come from the legislative body, in this chamber and across the way, but under the congressional system, where there is a true doctrine of the separation of powers in operation, the executive comes by way of appointment by the president from people outside the elected congress. It may well be that, if we were to move to an elected presidential system, the people of Australia may also consider that to move to an appointed executive outside the elected membership may be a better way to proceed. It is often heard in debate from people who criticise the calibre of the ministers—and anyone who sees this chamber on B-day when the B-team is in can see it—that there is a lot lacking.

         The point is this: if we are to embrace the thought of change and have a true debate, we need a forum where it can be held honestly. This is not the place for that debate because here, under our Westminster system—altered and perhaps corrupted as it is—we still have the system where the Prime Minister, the person who says he has a majority in the House to support the passage of the appropriation bills through both houses of parliament, is given a commission to form a government by the head of state, the Governor-General, Bill Hayden; and he looked pretty Australian to me last time I took a look. That government then consists of the people chosen by the Prime Minister, the man to whom the commission is given. He currently selects about 30 people to become members of the Executive Council. Those people and those people alone form the government. The Labor Party backbenchers are no more members of government than I am. Their responsibility is the same as mine; that is, to provide laws which are for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. Their positioning on the right-hand side of the Speaker's chair is merely to indicate that they are giving support to the government to ensure the passage of its legislation and particularly the appropriation bills—the granting of supply.

         We saw in 1975 that it is the Governor-General who is the head of state in this country, who holds the reserve powers, who has the power to sack the government of the day, which simply means he or she withdraws the commission that has been given because that government can no longer carry out its undertaking to ensure the passage of supply. So that is the way the system works. But, if we are to have the change to the president, we could see the situation where the president of the day has been elected by two-thirds of the parliament, as the Prime Minister would wish, and he sends his legislation up to the head of state and the head of state says, `Veto.' The Prime Minister says, `You can't do that to me.' `Yes, I can,' says the president, `just watch me. Now get two-thirds of the parliament to sack me.' It might be a piece of legislation like the new 12 per cent wholesale sales tax with regard to building materials that might be chosen to be vetoed, and two-thirds of the parliament might think that is a jolly good idea.

         There are lots of questions that have to be addressed. There are lots of queries and uncertainties that need to be debated, and the place to have that is in a people's forum, because in this place it is only the government of the day that can introduce the bill for the referendum. It is only the government which would have input into what goes into that bill and it would be a take it or leave it scenario. But, if you have a people's convention, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has proposed and given an undertaking to have, the people who are not truly represented in their view, as they see it, will have a say. The government of the day has said it will only offer a president who is elected by the parliament, and the people of Australia have shown that they do not want that, and it is only the government of the day which will have a say as to what goes into that bill that brings about the referendum.

         However, under our system, there is even a fail-safe mechanism. There is the people's convention, and then there is a plebiscite. The plebiscite would have the following options: elected by the parliament, elected by the people, status quo, et cetera. So a whole range of things could come out of that. Depending on the outcome of that plebiscite, the referendum would then be formulated. It would not be formulated by the government of the day. It would not be formulated by the now Prime Minister saying, `I, me, myself, personally, Paul Keating, am going to dictate that that is the choice you will be given,' but by the option being given to hundreds of Australians to have the opportunity to take part in the discussion process.

         The second question—how it makes Australia a better place—remains to be answered by those who say they want to bring about the change as manifested in the Prime Minister's greater wish. As we debate this, we know that the option is one of choice. The government offers none. The option is to take what the Prime Minister of the day wishes it to be or to allow the people of Australia to have a say in what happens to their constitution. The bottom line is that the constitution of Australia belongs to the Australian people. It does not belong to the Prime Minister or to the government of the day. It is not their plaything.

Either they do not understand what the Australian constitution is or they have not read it. The Australian constitution is, in fact, a bill of the British parliament. It clearly defines that the head of state of Australia is the monarch of Great Britain whom, in some strange way, we call the Queen of Australia.

         However, the reality is that the British monarch is simply that—the British monarch. Queen Elizabeth II is a fine and upright woman.

By some strange legal reasoning, Australia has decided to adopt her and call her the Queen of Australia. Clearly, the head of state is the British monarch. So no-one in the coalition should try to promote this nonsense that somehow the Governor-General is the Australian head of state.

         When we have a debate such as this, the lack of understanding in this House on the nature of the Australian constitution is also something that worries me. The constitution is a document which is vacant on most of the important things that matter in running this parliament. For example, most Australians do not understand that there is no such thing as a Prime Minister mentioned in the entire Australian constitution. It is not mentioned—not once. It is a convention that there is a Prime Minister. It is not written into our constitution. It is a convention, because we all understand that without the conventions operating we would not have a constitution which would work.

         So the Australian constitution is lacking in almost everything that a modern constitution needs. We are only talking about one part of it—a minor part of it. I must say that, if I had my way, I would rewrite the entire constitution, because it is a terribly deficient document. Can you imagine having a constitution which does not recognise the position of Prime Minister? It does not mention the word once in the entire document. It operates only on the basis of what we call conventions. Conventions are simply unwritten rules which people in the political system accept as being proper and reasonable so that the system can in fact run. Without the recognition of the conventions, we would not have a parliament that would work. That is how bad the Australian constitution really is.

         To some members opposite it is some sacred document written in blood—something magical and special. The fact is, of course, that when it was written it was written in conflict. It was a compromise. It is not a perfect document. It was a compromise between six competing colonies who were not particularly interested in a federation. They wanted to maintain their own separate political identities. There were free traders and protectionists. Again, I do wish some people in this House would actually pick up a book on Australian history and read it. I do wish they would actually learn the background to how the Australian constitution came into existence.

         The vast bulk of conventions, so-called, that were held to draft the Australian constitution were not elected. Only one was elected—the last one. But the conventions that actually drew up the constitution were not elected because, in most locally held referenda, the Australian people did not want to federate. It was the leaders of the day, who understood the great need for Australia to become a great nation, who led the arguments and brought the general feeling of the people with them. That is what needs to be done in changing a constitution. You need leaders. You need people to stand up and put a proposition to people and say, `We believe we need change and this is the change we believe we need.' That is called leadership. It might be that the Australian people reject that view. Nevertheless, the fact that it has been brought into the public domain, that it is now a topic which is being publicly debated, is only because there is a leader—the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not the sort of thing we would ever get from the other side of the House. There is never any leadership from that side in terms of change.

         The Australian constitution was developed by people such as Deakin, despite the general lack of will in the then colonies to federate. We eventually got federation because there were leaders back then who were prepared to carry the people, take some political flak and run the argument. So it is important that the argument be put. It is important that we debate it. It may well be that the end result of change to the Australian constitution may not be what I necessarily agree with because, ultimately, it will be Australian people who make the decision—not me, not this parliament, not the Prime Minister, but the Australian people.

When Barwick was the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia the Australian taxation system was totally torn asunder. Under section 260 of the tax act, a very simple section—I would say a five-year-old child could tell you what it meant—tax avoidance was illegal. That is all it said, but somehow or other the Barwick court managed to rule that that did not mean anything.

         —The speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), was somewhat lacking in credibility when he was starting to presume what the opposition position is. It is quite clear that a people's convention will be called and that it will decide which questions go to a referendum. The Australian people will have the chance to decide whether we remain a monarchy or move to a republic. Nothing could be clearer than that.

         I find it quite bizarre that we are having this debate in the chamber for most of the day when there are other issues out there that are concerning my constituents more than this. We have a debt in this country, for example, that is greater than Mexico's. It is unbelievable that we have been reduced to that status under this government. A debt greater than Mexico's is something that we ought to be ashamed of, something that we certainly should be doing something about, and the government will not even allow us to have a question time tomorrow to talk about the current account deficit figures when they come out, let alone have a debate on the debt that this country is carrying, which is now greater than Mexico's.

We have a stable system of government that is envied by the rest of the world. We live in a very free country, a very tolerant, multicultural country.

         We are even a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and it is interesting to note that 22 out of the 51 members are still monarchies; the others are republics. It is a little ironic to me because I have always felt that in a sense Australia really is a republic. I know we call it a monarchy but to all intents and purposes, given the way the system works in this country, we already are a republic. I do not know what the percentage would be but Australia would be very close to 99 per cent a republic anyhow. We have only got this little bit tacked on the end, this one per cent, this monarchy bit tacked on the end, and it is totally harmless. It gives the Queen no effective power whatsoever over the running of this country. If the Queen had some power to direct us how to conduct the laws of this nation or our daily lives, I too would be arguing that that link be cut.

         In the mid-1980s, when I had been a member of the House for a short time, I attended a peace conference in Bulgaria. In those days Bulgaria was probably the most repressive communist country in the world. It is a wonderful country and, fortunately, that system has now gone. I had never been to a communist country before, and apart from the stark, colourless concrete buildings and streets everywhere, and the people with blank looks on their faces, the thing that horrified me the most was that on the buildings were enormous photos of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Todor Zhikov, who was the president of Bulgaria at the time.

         My first memory of the monarchy comes from 1 May 1970, when, as a nine-year-old student at Ashcroft Primary School, I lined the street to watch Princess Anne pass by on her way to opening the Green Valley Community Centre. I was there because the school had made it compulsory. For me, it was a curiosity. For a schoolboy standing on the streets of working-class Green Valley, nothing could have been more curious than the idea that we were, in any way, associated with a family—the royal family—founded on the worst traditions of social hierarchy, elitism and class distinction. For a schoolboy born in Australia, knowing nothing of Britain other than from school books, nothing could be more foreign than the idea that we were in some way affiliated to Britain.

To feel proud of Australia—to feel strongly about this country—is to want Australia to be strong. We are stronger when we stand on our own two feet, when we do things our way and when we express ourselves in an independent way. Let there be no doubt—we would be stronger, as a people and as a nation, if the Australian head of state were an Australian citizen.

         If I can continue the analogy further, the formulation of the Australian constitution from the 1890s led to Australia's birth as a federated nation in 1901. In this debate it is very important to get a feel and appreciation for the national mood and the politics of that era, now 100 years ago. Australia had, as its earliest and strongest emotion—this goes back as far as 1788—the need for protection, the need to shelter the colony, as it was at that time, from what was regarded as a vulnerable place in the world. It is not surprising, if  we consider how insecure those early Australians would have been at the thought of being part of a penal colony. Two hundred years ago Australia was a convict colony at the bottom of the world, isolated from what, at that time, was the homeland in Europe.

         As a result of those feelings of insecurity at the very first time of white settlement in Australia, this feeling of protection was woven into our culture, our institutions and our system of government. The sense of insecurity and the need for protection was given expression through tariff protection, the attempt to shelter Australian markets from overseas goods. It was expressed through the White Australia policy which enjoyed bipartisan political support for so long, giving expression to the feeling that we needed to lock out people from other races and other nations, particularly in Asia.

         The sense of insecurity was expressed through our foreign policy: our reliance on the protection of, firstly, the Royal Navy and, during and after the Second World War, the United States of America.

         The popular culture of those years of course reinforced the view of the British as a superior race of people. The royal family stood at the pinnacle of that system. The republic is about breaking the cultural cringe for all time. It is about recognising, for all time, that Australia should assume in all aspects of our social and cultural fabric the responsibilities of an independent and mature nation. The cultural cringe extended far beyond the realm of the arts. For so many years, it made the country wary of assuming proper responsibili ties.

         More than that, the republic represents a great opportunity to rectify some of the problems with the constitutional monarchy. At the end of the day, in a modern, liberal, progressive, egalitarian society, the monarchy can be regarded, and I think broadly is regarded, throughout Australia as unrepresentative and undemocratic. There is an objection across the nation to filling public offices in a fashion which relies on inheritance. It is contrary to the belief that all people are born equal in status, dignity and opportunity. The rules of succession for the monarchy as we have them in Australia discriminate on the basis of religion, sex and birth. Section 116 of the Australia constitution prohibits the imposition of any religious test as a qualification for any office under the Commonwealth, yet our head of state, the British monarch, also serves as the head of the Anglican Church.

For Australians interested in social equality, religious tolerance and equal opportunity between the sexes, the monarchy has become an unrepresentative, unsuitable, divisive institution in our society. It has been used in the past to show that Australians were of British stock. That is clearly no longer the case. The monarchy is perhaps well suited to a class ridden society like Britain, but it is totally unsuited to Australia's egalitarian traditions.

Working men here do not go slouching down the streets, as they do in England, crushed under the sense of their inferiority. . . This is a true republic, the truest, as I take it, in the world.

        So, if we have had in our social status, in our social fabric, this feeling of republic egalitarianism, it should be fully confirmed now in the 1990s in Australia's constitutional arrangements. For once, on this matter I can agree with the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. He said in the second reading speech on the Royal Style and Titles Bill 1953:

        Menzies thought that was acceptable because he regarded himself as British, as of British stock. But now, when Australians no longer regard themselves in that fashion, it is no longer suitable for the Australian head of state to be determined by British law. The Australian head of state should be one of us. The Australian head of state should be determined by Australians under Australian laws passed by this parliament and confirmed at a constitutional referendum.

         The truth of the matter is that an Australian citizen, under the current arrangements, can never be the Australian head of state. That is a decisive breach, an unacceptable breach, of Australian sovereignty and independence. It is interesting to note that Prince Charles himself acknowledged as much in June last year when he said that, as an heir and successor, he would rather be seen as a defender of faith than a defender of `the faith'. That is, he acknowledged that all citizens are equally important irrespective of religion. It is divisive for the monarchy to be associated with just one form and one expression of faith.

         Prince Charles also said that it is absurd the monarch should be prevented from marrying a Catholic. So if Prince Charles believes the monarchy, as presently structured, does not represent all Britons, how can it represent all Australians? Prince Charles is saying that the head of state in Britain must be representative of British society. In Australia, surely that means the head of state must be an Australian.

         A republic is a state in which sovereignty is derived from people, not from inheritance, and in which all public offices are filled by persons ultimately deriving their authority from the people. The only Australian office incompatible with a republic is the monarchy, and the only change required to overcome that shortcoming is to remove the monarchy from our constitution.

         When the Queen visits Australia she is seen more as the Queen of Britain than the Queen of Australia, otherwise she serves as an absentee head of state. When the Queen visits other nations, she is seen as the Queen of Britain. Australia does not have a head of state who can represent this nation overseas and be seen by foreign citizens as our head of state, as an Australian. That, in their eyes, makes Australia look like a colony.

When talking to different people throughout the United Kingdom, the one dominant question was: is the government's push or the notion of moving towards a republic in Australia purely born out of a hate for the British? That is the feeling that they are getting in the United Kingdom. We had to dispel that myth and point out that it is not born out of a hate for the British.

It should not be the 148 representatives in this parliament who make a decision and make this into a political debate between now and when the Prime Minister decides he wants to hold his referendum and ask the people of Australia whether or not they are prepared to accept his option.

         What is the coalition's position? The coalition proposes the establishment of a people's convention in 1997 which would examine not just whether or not Australia should become a republic but other important issues as well. One of the issues is the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution. Another issue is the implications of a change in the role of the states. There is an underlying complication in this debate which relates to the states. The conundrum could arise where the Commonwealth as a whole wants to head down a certain path but one of the states does not.

The arguments for a people's convention, as put forward by the coalition, include enabling a range of community views to enable proper examination, gauging the mood for change in the Australian community, and providing a forum which unifies rather than divides the community.

On the other hand, there is the very clear position of the coalition—that in 1997 we head for a people's convention so that we can devolve the debate, devolve the power, and empower the people of Australia to have a much broader input into the development of the arguments for and against the question, and the development of the debate, as to whether we should go towards a republic, whether the head of state should be selected and elected by a two-thirds majority of this parliament, or whether the head of state should be elected by everybody in Australia.

        We have heard much in this discussion about a republic, and it seems that some people feel the very fabric of Australian society is being challenged. Let me say to you that surely the issue of an Australian head of state does go to the heart of the Australian government. It is surely an issue about equality. We need to look at the role of the constitutional monarchy and ask ourselves: who is a monarch? Where do monarchs come from? What gives them authority to rule? What gives them authority to rule is an accident of birth.

         I think most of us now would recognise that there are values and attitudes within the British monarchy that most of us as Australians would not wish to emulate, nor would we wish to espouse. When we look to our own nation as an Australian we see the kinds of things that make us Australian. At the heart of it is the issue of equality. At the heart of it is the right—more importantly, the obligation—of all Australian citizens to exercise their democratic right to vote. There is no question of a notion of birth, of where one comes from or of who one is. It simply states that as Australians, as citizens of this nation, we have equality before the law and in the role of this government.

         It is interesting to hear members of the opposition talk about the notion of stability which comes from a constitutional monarchy. I suggest to members of the opposition that one of the great things that leads to stability within the Australian democratic process is the fact that we all participate, that there is a role for each and every one of us. Contrary to very many other industrialised nations in which small groups of people who happen to be better educated, happen to have more money or happen to be able to buy votes are the people who rule, all Australians vote and we in this parliament represent our electors. In fact, once that election has taken place, we then represent all of those people who reside within that area.

         If we are talking realistically about the notion of a head of state being elected by two-thirds of both houses of this parliament, we can say almost categorically that that person will not be from the field of politics. If, however, we are to have a universally elected head of state, we can absolutely and categorically expect that that person will be either party political or extraordinarily rich. We will be looking at someone who has to garner the votes of 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 Australians and who needs the wherewithal and the financial capital to do that.

         The election by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate means that the president will not be a member of either of the major political parties. This person will be chosen in a bipartisan manner. The potential president will also be somebody who is looked upon in the light of the checks and balances which operate within this community and within this parliamentary process. It will also be somebody who then gets his or her power from the elected members of the parliament.

         This notion of a people's convention is particularly extraordinary. Firstly I draw people back to the 1890s conventions which were proponents of change. They were concerned with only one question: how to create, from separate Australian colonies, a Commonwealth of Australia. More than half of the Australian population were non-participatory in that early people's convention. Most people will know that no female had any role in any of those conventions. Indeed, school children upstairs in the gallery may be interested to know that women were required to sit up there and watch the proceedings while the men decided what the Commonwealth of Australia was to be about.

         I am not suggesting that a people's convention as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition would exclude women, but I do know that he is appointing half the delegates. In my summation, that means, `I have control of the numbers.' I find it quite extraordinary to dress this people's convention up as something which is open and free to all people if `I am appointing half the people'. To me, a convention is no sacred cow. I see the 1890s convention as having brought about the Commonwealth of Australia but having excluded me and all those other women who go to make up the other half of the Australian population. I look at the 1973-85 conventions in Australia and I see that none of them were able to come to any conclusion at all.

There will be plenty of time to debate the serious and important constitutional issues involved in the proposals for a republic. In my short contribution at this stage I do not want to delve too deeply into that, but I do want to ask a few questions about the methods and motives of the government in pursuit of its republic, particularly about the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

         To change the constitution it is necessary to go through all the formalities under section 128 of the constitution. This means that there must be a referendum proposal passed by a majority of this House and of the Senate, and that it must be put to the electors. It will only be passed if it is approved by a majority of electors in a majority of states and by an overall majority of electors voting.

         When we look at what is involved in a referendum proposal for Australia to become a republic, the changes involved to the Australian constitution are massive, even on a proposal that seeks to effect least change. In addition, it must be borne in mind that the Crown is also the symbol of each of the states. Each state has a constitution and, in order to change those constitutions, whatever is required under the respective state constitutions must also be gone through. In effect, in seeking for Australia to become a true republic, you are asking for seven sets of changes—all of them major—to be effected simultaneously. It would be very easy for such proposals to be defeated if there is any significant sector of the community which does not support it.

         There has been no referendum proposal passed since 1977. The most recent attempt, in 1988, failed because the proposals did not have bipartisan support. It is highly unlikely that any proposal put to a referendum would pass if it did not have the support of the major parties. It is highly unlikely that it would pass if it did not have the support of all of the states and, in particular, if it is seen as a threat to the smaller states.

         In the light of that, one might wonder why the proponents of an Australian republic do not seek to make the issue a bipartisan one, because it is only if it becomes bipartisan that it will be approved. The Australian Labor Party has had the subject of an Australian republic as part of its platform since 1981. So far as I am aware, absolutely nothing was done between 1981 and 1992, except in 1987 when the platform was amended to set a target date of 2001.

         The matter seems first to have been raised by the Labor Party in the public arena during the 1992-93 election. It was raised in a very odd situation—obviously, a partisan situation where the parties were contesting an election. The Prime Minister came up with the extraordinary proposition that it would be good for the economy if Australia were to become a republic. I fail to see any relationship between the nature of the constitutional arrangement at the pinnacle of our government and economic conditions.

         Subsequent to that election, there commenced what was referred to—erroneously, in my belief—as the republican debate. It was somewhat pointless because it seemed to raise the question: do you want Australia to become a republic? If not, why not? It did not descend to the question: if yes, what sort of republic do you want? That debate went on, promoted by journalists, for some considerable time until April 1993 when the Prime Minister decided to appoint a Republic Advisory Committee.

         The Republic Advisory Committee might have promoted a bipartisan approach had the question of the appointment of the committee been approached by the Prime Minister in a bipartisan way, but it was not. He pointedly appointed a former Liberal Premier who was a pro-republican to the committee, invited the then Leader of the Opposition to nominate one person to a 10-person committee and required the states, each of which has a different and significant interest, to appoint one representing larger states and one representing smaller states. The result was that there was a committee which was seen right from the outset as being the subject of a partisan appointment process.

         The Prime Minister seems to have thought it was also a relatively simple question to determine how to become a republic because he gave the committee a very short time frame within which to report. In fact, it could not report within that time frame and got a one-month extension. The government received the report in October 1993. The government then said, `Well, we won't be announcing what we are proposing immediately. We will do that early in 1994.' However, the Australian public waited in vain for the whole of 1994 for a government response.

         The government must not have found it very easy to develop a response to the Republic Advisory Committee report, because nothing emanated from the government until 7 June.

The response was given at a time when there was frequent and loud talk of the prospect of an election.

         The response by the government, to promote a head of state elected by the houses of parliament jointly, is no doubt a valid proposal worthy of consideration by the Australian public in the course of the republican debate that will no doubt continue for some time.

It would be ludicrous to contemplate an Australian republic without the states being involved in the transformation from a monarchy to a republic.

         Second, in the context of public opinion, the proposal adopted runs strongly counter to the public's substantial majority view that the head of state should be elected by the people.

The response from the government was not put until as late as this month in the context of a possible early election.

         In the course of announcing the government's proposals, the Prime Minister also said that what we have is a simple question.

He camouflages the real issue, because in order to get a true Australian head of state—the Governor-General effectively being an Australian head of state—we have to ask how we get one. It is not, therefore, simply a question of: do you want an Australian head of state? It is: do you want an Australian head of state elected by the Australian people? Do you want an Australian head of state elected by the parliament? Do you want one appointed by the Prime Minister? Do you want one who is elected by the state governors, or is one of the state governors appointed to serve for a limited time, as has been seriously suggested?

As foreshadowed in October last year by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he was the Leader of the Opposition, the coalition will, on being elected to government, convene in 1997 a people's constitutional convention. Half the delegates will be elected; half will be appointed. They will be elected on state and territory bases, with parliamentarians disqualified from running for election. The election process will recognise that young people, women and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds are currently underrepresented in decision making processes.

Ten per cent of those at the convention will be in the age group 18 to 25. If a consensus emerges from the people's convention as to what should be done about a head of state, the coalition has undertaken that that will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum.

         The coalition also provides for the possibility of there being no real consensus, just as there is in the community at the moment, on a particular form of republic. In that event the coalition would put a series of options to the people for them to vote on.

When talking about those interests she is talking about the interests of England and the trade of England and the economies of the United Kingdom. That is fine. That is the way it should be for her as the head of England, but it should not be that way for the head of Australia.

         We may ask why we have hung onto these remnants of the past for so long. There are a lot of reasons. Our history, our early European population, was British based. The economy was geared to the European market until relatively recently and certainly until postwar in Australia. Maybe it was tied too close, maybe we should have broken the ties earlier. Our population is English speaking, with an accent somewhat equivalent to cockney English. Therefore we were seen as an easy place for English migrants to settle. We do have some strong ties, and some of us have strong memories. My wife is English born, so my mother-in-law is English—a great woman. She came to live in Australia in 1983, was naturalised in 1984 and at 78 now firmly believes that Australia should have its own head of state, should be able to state its own case with its own head and should be proud of the fact that it has a head of state born and bred in Australia.

         As Australia's population has grown through its migrants, especially its postwar migrants, through those changes Australia has come away from the European economy. Many more nationalities have settled in Australia and we have changed from our early roots. Those changes in trade were very easy to see in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s when England went into the Common Market and basically destroyed the Tasmanian apple industry. It was the right thing for England to do but it certainly did not do anything for Australia's trade and it certainly did not do anything for a major industry in Tasmania.

         In England now the Prime Minister is having a few difficulties in convincing his more conservative colleagues in his own party that England should be going into the European Union in a fully fledged way, as all the other nations are. That is probably right for England and that is probably where it should be in its trading bloc, endeavouring to gain the best out of that. But Australia's future is in the Asian region, the Pacific rim. That touches everything from South America to the Americas, North America and Canada right through Japan, right down to China, right around Asia and even across to South Africa and the Indian rim.

         Under the current constitution, the head of state is the Queen. Most of her responsibilities are carried out by the Governor-General. The only power she retains is the appointment of the Governor-General which, by convention, she does on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. The historical aspect of that is that in 1933 the Governor-General ceased to be the representative of the British government in Australia and became solely the representative of the Queen. In the same decade, it was accepted that the British monarch would act on the advice of the Australian government, not the British government. Also Australia assumed responsibility for its own external affairs—its foreign affairs as we call it today.

         In 1980 all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London ceased. Australian courts became the ultimate arbitrator of Australian law. There has been a move towards our becoming a republic over the years, and we have divested ourselves of a connection to British law, its courts and its appeal system. In the Australia Act, the UK relinquished the last vestiges of power, making only Australian law apply to Australia—a small but important step and the last in a process which began about 100 years ago.

         I know that the polls have shown that within our country people would like to vote on the head of state. I think as we emerge from this debate—although I am sure there will still be a lot of debate before there is a referendum—people may come to realise that changing the way we elect the head of state from a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament would require a major change to the power structure that we presently have in this country. Hence, we would have to rewrite and change the power of the Senate. We would have to look at the power of the Prime Minister, the Executive Council and the executive government. A major change would have to take place, and that process would involve enormous changes to the power structure.

If a president tried to pursue an issue like that, it could bring us into a constitutional crisis.

         —After eight accords over 12 years—each accord covers a period of about 1 1/2 to two years—with Accord Mark VIII we can see for the first time the development of a permanent perpetual wages system whereby, having used the accords to move away from the centralised wage fixing structure, we are now moving to a decentralised wage fixing structure. In that decentralised wage fixing structure, enterprise bargaining is growing apace throughout the community.

         Those working Australians who cannot avail themselves of an enterprise bargain will be protected by the safety net being proposed by the government. In other words, we have had accords which dealt with award restructuring and flexibility within awards and we have had accords which were predicated on the amalgamation of major unions under a system of award restructuring. That now largely having been accomplished, we can focus on a permanent wages system with low inflation.

         I imagine that it is a matter of some substantial comfort to the community that the ACTU, on behalf of the work force, said that, for the period of this Accord, the wages system will be based on an underlying inflation rate on average of two to three per cent over the cycle. I ran into an employer's representative yesterday and he said to me, `I grew up with automatic wage indexation. For my whole working life there has been automatic wage indexation.' To see an underlying rate of inflation of two to three per cent—in other words, running the wages system, including the enterprise bargaining stream to produce two to three per cent inflation—is a quite remarkable and revolutionary change. It means that we can run the Australian economy faster than we would otherwise be able to were we relying simply on interest rates to curtail inflation.

         I have talked in this House before about the debilitating effect that double-digit inflation that we had for 15 years had on this country. I have made the point that people could not save at the levels they were when inflation was tearing the quality and value out of their savings. With low inflatison and an accord of this kind we are also seeing a very great reduction in industrial disputation and we have seen a much greater promotion of industrial peace in the period.

Can the Prime Minister also confirm that in the first of these letters he did not make any mention whatsoever of Australia's concerns about the possible resumption of French nuclear testing. Is not the failure of the Prime Minister to even mention nuclear testing in his first letter to President Chirac simply proof that the Prime Minister never intended to do more on French nuclear testing than write letters to the editor of

Our position has been clear all along.

It certainly continues our tradition of industrial harmony—the one we are so pleased and proud to boast about. And what better day to show it off than the day the ABS statistics have been released, showing that for last year, 1994, Australia recorded the lowest number of industrial disputes in any year since 1940—the lowest number of industrial disputes for 55 years. What a sensational performance!

         That is in stark contrast to the promise of what members of the opposition have in store if ever they are elected to government in this country. There is no comprehensive award safety net under them whatsoever. There is an absence of a no disadvantage test against which enterprise bargains can be measured. There are no safety net increases. There is a single miserable hourly rate of pay. How do we know this when there has been no release of the federal policy? It is worth noting that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition went to Queensland and released the Queensland state opposition's IR policy. It provided all of these things—each and every one of them.

         The approach of the opposition to industrial relations is no different now from what it was in 1993. It destroys all workers' protections. It would return us to the industrial turmoil, shown here so graphically, of the early 1980s.

Prime Minister, some two years ago, in reflecting the concern of a substantial section of the Australian community, I indicated to the House that, regrettably, you were coming dangerously close to becoming the Neville Chamberlain of South-East Asia in respect of our relations with Indonesia. Does not the agreement of the government to the appointment of Lieutenant General Mantiri as Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, whose view is that the Dili massacre was `a quite proper response', reinforce the view that the government is following a policy of appeasement to a military dictatorship? Given the fact that this appointment flies in the face of Australian public opinion since 1975, why have you allowed this ambassadorial appointment to humiliate this country in the eyes of the world and to hold up to ridicule any human rights statements this country may make in world forums?

It is a relationship which is absolutely central to Australian foreign policy. For that relationship to be operated only on the basis of a foreign policy relationship, or one that takes the opportunity of simply expressing exclusively an Australian view or a sectional Australian view as the basis for the operation of that policy, would be doing the wrong thing by Australians.

         It is more the pity that, for a very long period of time, so much of the Australia-Indonesia relationship has centred around Timor; it has because of what has happened there. Australia has made clear that it has condemned the denial of liberties and the denial of human rights in that province and has sought a better order in that province. But it wants to conduct that conversation about East Timor in the context of a broader conversation with Indonesia about the totality of the relationship and our relative importance to one another.

         I think we can see that there has been a substantial change in the way in which Indonesia accepts the Australian view, deals with the Australian view. One should remember also the changes which are taking place in Indonesia. About eight years ago 65 per cent of Indonesians lived below the poverty line; that is now 15 per cent. There has been a substantial distribution of the wealth in Indonesia. One can see the changes taking place there perpetually. As a consequence, there is a lot of improvement in living standards and, with it, the general human condition in that country. They are advances which I think Australia should encourage and applaud.

         So, while we will always take the view that wherever liberties are constrained or human rights violated we will forcibly put our view—which we have done and will continue to do with Indonesia—that we do want to maintain a broad relationship with that country. I do not see the character of General Mantiri's appointment being such as to rupture that relationship. In saying that, I say that in the broad interests of the Australian people.

This began with the Economic Summit in 1983, the prices and incomes accord, and consultation with employer groups and the peak union bodies under the Accord to curtail prices and to see wages come back to be within affordable levels. That process has continued right down the years, and Accord Mark VIII is a further development of that process of consultation.

         You can see it again more recently in the consultations that the government had with the peak farm bodies last year and in the consultations we are still having in relation to such questions as land management and soil and water conservation. By and large, the government has believed that, on a basis of talking and listening to interest groups, one can secure policy solutions which advance the country more rapidly and more fully. As a consequence, we advance ourselves in a way that we might not otherwise. In the last two months, the government has delivered a number of profound reforms. In fact, I doubt whether any government has been quite so productive in such a short period of time, and the process of consultation that we have had has encouraged it.

Opposition members say they are in touch but they will not, on any basis of trust, tell the public what their policy prescriptions might be. It seems to me that it is an antithesis of the argument of being in touch. You are so out of touch that you do not believe the public should know what your policy thinking is, and you will not bring them into it. You will not even tell your own backbench. I heard the interjection from the member for Flinders. When his GST proposal was unveiled in the last parliament, it was, of course, again without consultation with the public or even with his own party.

Yet the Leader of the Opposition will tell us that the opposition is in touch with the public—the same public he will not share his secrets with, the same public he has no trust in and the same public who have no relationship of trust with him. The opposition has no process of consultation, no accord, no discussion with bodies like the peak farm bodies and no discussion with the employer groups, as the government has.

         Mr Howard is either too scared or too embarrassed to release his policies. The point I want to make is that the country has advanced by frankness. It has advanced by consultation. It has advanced by sharing information. It has advanced by taking the public into the government's trust. This has not happened with the opposition, which claims to be in touch with the very people it believes it cannot trust.

How could the women's business be secret if it had been not only discussed with men but also—as now confirmed by Mr Rigney—initiated by men?

I will do no such thing.

         —I am aware of a continuing stream of proposals to loosen fiscal policy which keep coming from the opposition. We saw in the reply to the budget from the Leader of the Opposition that the opposition was determined to oppose various tax measures, which would have meant a loosening of fiscal policy to the tune of $1 1/2 billion this year and $2 1/2 billion the subsequent year. Since then the opposition has proposed one expenditure measure, that is, in relation to non-work related child care. Now we see another, in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The opposition is taking the view that various measures proposed by the government to stop the rapid growth of one of the fastest growing expenditure items in our whole array of outlays should be opposed.

         The opposition has taken the view that in regard to our attempts to clarify the eligibility criteria and to prevent various claims which have been made on the basis of an application of the law which we never intended, such as, for instance, to diesel fuel used in maintaining council parks and gardens or in quarrying activity, there should be no retrospective application of that legislation to prevent claims being made on a basis which the government never intended them to be made. That is, the opposition wants the companies which are making these claims to be able to get money out of the government on the basis of an application of the law which was never intended by the legislature.

         The money involved in this is substantial. It is about $160 million, if all the court decisions were to go against the government. That is the amount of money at risk and that is the addition to outlays which would come from the opposition being successful in its attempts to prevent the government from restricting outlays in this area.

         It does not stop there. The opposition is also trying to prevent us from eliminating quarrying prospectively as an area which would not qualify for the diesel fuel rebate. That would cost an extra $20 million per annum approximately. So what we are looking at here is, across the forward estimates, something in the order of $240 million of additional outlays—that is, $160 million for the various claims and an annual $20 million for the inclusion of quarrying.

         It should also be noted that of the $160 million of claims, $90 million would go to three companies. Those three companies, of course, have charged their customers in the past for the full amount of their costs, including the diesel cost without the rebate. Do you think those companies are going to hand back the $90 million to their customers? If you do, you have another think coming. If you really believe that, you are totally naive. This will just be $90 million straight into the pockets of three companies, to their benefit and to the benefit of their shareholders.

         The naked truth is that this is an opposition without any policy credibility whatsoever. This is supposedly the alternative government, but it totally lacks policy credibility. It is trying to have the argument at the macro-level by saying, `We support fiscal tightening.' At the same time, it is opposing all the measures at the individual level—even, incredibly, the outlays measures. How could anyone take such an opposition seriously? How could anyone believe that this is an opposition with credibility and decency and with any policy ideas? By God, you need that brainstorming session tomorrow.

         That particular proposition comes on top of the opposition's propositions that we had occasion to mention here earlier in the week. The hurdle those opposite fell over—as opposed to how they stumbled, got up, ran round and jumped over again in the case of the export market development grants scheme—was in the area of the restriction to non-working mothers of a very generous 12 hours a week subsidised child care. The opposition spokesperson said that I had been mistaken. I turn now to the relevant press article, which has not been denied by the coalition. It states:

        That has not been denied by the opposition, and we costed it. The cost was $1 1/2 billion. It is a $1 1/2 billion promise that you find yourselves committed to. As far as the increased diesel fuel rebate outlays issue is concerned, which was referred to by the Treasurer earlier—

They do not put anything on the revenue side; they do not in any way hit for revenue anyone whom they regard as their strong supporters. They put it all on the outlays side. As far as the rebate is concerned we are talking about an outlays option not a proposal that actually imposes a tax retrospectively.

         Nobody would collect, if that decision were to go through, an amount of money off anybody. In fact, it would be a donation. Big hearted Arthur across the chamber would make a donation of $160 million to highly profitable companies, with no obligation on those companies to pay it across to people that they have already charged to cover that tax. Those opposite do not worry about them, but they get stuck into the safety net and they get stuck into the battlers in society to make up for the $400 billion worth of outlays that they are prepared to add on.

But on the test that matters most in Western Europe, on the bulk of the largest conglomeration of economic states in the world in Europe—that test is to join the single market—Australia would have been one of two or three countries able to join on the basis of its budget surplus and its government debt. Government debt of Ireland is 85 per cent; of Germany it is 58 per cent. From recollection, government debt of Australia is 16 per cent. If we want some measures about how Australia is doing, we would have come second out of the 15 states in respect of joining the single market. Let us keep these things in some general context.

         —You get more tax from more growth. The more people buy whitegoods or some of the other items of manufacturing equipment or other substances or other things which are sales taxed, the more tax they pay. That is why the sales tax rises. The general point that Australians are interested in is the total tax take—not the wholesale sales tax. In respect of the total tax take, Australia is the second lowest taxed country in the world. That was not always so. It was not true under the member for Bennelong when he had his sticky fingers in the Treasury till. It was not the case then. It has been the case in declines of government spending under this government.

The top rate has dropped from 60 per cent, under John Howard's treasurership, to 47 per cent tax, and the tax-free threshold has risen. When we look at the revenue and, therefore, the tax levied on Australians, we see that this is a lightly taxed country. This would not be so under a high taxing coalition government. The high taxation specialist is the coalition, the Liberal and National parties—the super tax merchants. We saw it at the last election, we have seen it in the past, and were they in office we would see it again.

         —The cross-media ownership rules passed by this parliament are designed to encourage diversity of ownership in the media. The changes which the government announced on Tuesday night will strengthen and buttress the cross-media ownership rules, and that is something which we believe will limit cross-media holdings, whether it be print, television or radio. These changes are a considered response to the report to the government from the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Despite claims by the Leader of the Opposition, they are not directed at any individual because the 15 per cent cap applies just as much to News Limited's investment in Channel 7 as it does to Channel 9's investment in Fairfax.

         What it does is provide more certainty for the industry because it provides, for the first time, a tightening of the net for the definition of `quasi equity' and puts the cap at 15 per cent and also maintains that control test for less than 15 per cent. For all of these reasons, the government believes that these changes are the right policy response to the ABA's report.

         That can be contrasted with comments that have been made in the last 48 hours by certain members of the opposition. Senator Alston, the opposition's official spokesman for communications, was asked on Tuesday night whether a coalition government would reverse these changes. He said, `Well, there's not much here to reverse.' Yet on Wednesday morning the Leader of the Opposition said, `It's a legislative dagger aimed at Mr Packer.' He said, `It's just a KO Kerry exercise.' But the previous night, according to AAP, Senator Alston said our proposals were expanding the types of shares covered by the act and that was overdue. But on Wednesday morning the Leader of the Opposition said that this was Packer specific and prejudiced, biased legislation. But on Tuesday night Senator Alston said, `It's a step in the right direction.'

I am starting to feel a bit sorry for Senator Alston. Is it any wonder he gets tangled up when the opposition, after 12 years, still does not have a media policy?

         The only firm statement we have on cross-media owership from the opposition is the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to abolish the cross-media ownership rules. He thinks we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act—the Trade Practices Act that he weakened and the member for Holt had to strengthen. And when the member for Holt introduced the changes to strengthen it the Deputy Leader of the Opposition opposed the changes. So the Leader of the Opposition says that we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act, even after the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission says that means there are no limits on cross-media ownership.

         —The very burden of the question is about the incidence of the weight of government policy on people, yet the questioner, as I said before, has opposed every wage increase since 1981, bar two. He supported a $16 wage increase in 14 years; that is all he has ever done. Yet he has the temerity to get up and talk about battlers, and he gave himself away in saying, `We've been battling for battlers for a week' when the Labor Party has been battling for them for a century.

         When we introduced in the budget the occupational superannuation change to give Australian working people the right to put away and have for their retirement 15 per cent of their income and to add to national savings, what did he say? He would crimp it at where the SGC now stands and give them tax concessions.

         When tax concessions were the order of the day there was only a 40 per cent coverage, and there is now a 90 per cent coverage. Not only would this be a bad thing to do in economic terms, in national savings terms, but it would be a very harsh thing to do to Australians, who finally under a Labor government have got themselves the right to a decent retirement income by accessing the superannuation provisions—which the Leader of the Opposition, never learning, now says he wants to crimp and leave the SGC.

         On those big brush issues—employment; complete fidelity by the government with the long-term unemployed; support for families by increases in family support, the guardians allowance, maternity leave, the home child-care allowance, the generalised child-care rebate—these were all specifics in the last election campaign and they have all been delivered. On top of that, the thing that we did not promise people but happily have been able to give them is 15 per cent occupational superannuation by the year 2002 for the rest of their lives, so that no Australian will be able to go into retirement worried about their income. Also, in Accord Mark VIII, in this last week, we have seen the payment of decent increases under enterprise bargaining—and a safety net for those who cannot access it—of $10 to $12 a week, and $11 to $14 for those on awards only.

As these questions have considerable significance to the conduct of this place and have not been answered, could you please take action under standing order 150 and write to those ministers requesting an urgent answer?

         —If anybody in this parliament were to ask Australians to sum up the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), they would invariably come up with one word. They would not come up with the word that he would like them to come up with, and that is the word `leadership'; they would come up with another word that he finds distinctly uncomfortable, and that is the word `arrogance'. He has arrogance of a personal kind; he has arrogance of a political kind; he has arrogance of an economic kind; and he has arrogance of an offensive un-Australian kind, which sits like stigmata on the head of the entire Keating government.

         It was with arrogance that the Prime Minister of Australia, after only five minutes of economic sunshine, told the Australian people that `this is as good as it ever gets'. He wonders why, through the length and breadth of Australia in 1995, he is regarded as an arrogant man. Yet having gone through the worst recession in 60 years with still a tragically high level of youth unemployment, with Australian home buyers now seeing 27 per cent of median family income devoured to pay off a home versus 19 per cent in 1983 and with Australians recognising that they and their families are labouring under a foreign debt that has increased by 600 per cent since 1983, he wonders why he is called arrogant. He wonders why so many Australians have now simply stopped listening to him.

Let us go through them. You had the disaster of the Canberra by-election—it is a fascinating study in political combat and political science—that brought our colleague over here, the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), into the House. It was not just the average by-election swing; it was the biggest by-election swing in modern Australian political history.

That struck a very discordant note. The Australian people thought to themselves that that is not really fair dinkum.

Nevertheless, this great defender of the battlers has to contemplate his record on things that are serious—such as the social wage. The social wage, which includes all those things that relate to the family support measures that have been put in place—and we have introduced many of them while we have been in office, but some were already there as hangovers from the Whitlam government when it was in power—fell 17 per cent in real terms while John Howard was Treasurer, and he made a virtue of that. Under us, and in a period of extraordinary restraint, the social wage has risen by something like 70 per cent in real terms since we have been in office.

He does not want any form of dissection of his policy positions. He does not want any dissection simply because he thinks it is a clever political tactic. It is not that. He does not want any dissection because he knows that, if you crack open the Liberal Party policy bank, you will find a series of unpalatable policies that will not work. You will discover an opposition too tired to come out with a sensible set of propositions to take the country forward.

        Two years ago, I had a private discussion with a very senior Liberal. At that time, Prime Minister Keating had nailed his republican ideals to the mast and I asked how the Liberal Party intended responding. "No worries. We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. With a people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party would not have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we want it."

         John Howard produced the most tired response conceivably possible to the vision that the Prime Minister presented. His first response included the statement: `We are going to have a people's convention. What we are going to do with that people's convention is not put anything on the republic; we will put to the people's convention whether or not we should change the external affairs power which protects our environment and protects people's wages.'

It revived all the flaws that brought him undone that first time six years ago. It marked him perhaps fatally as truly yesterday's man. It exposed him more brutally than ever as a leader locked into the past; as a politician of indecision, no courage, no guile, no ideas, no true understanding of his own country in the 1990s and no feel for the future. If it wasn't complete humbug, it was absolute political disaster.

         You should do the sort of thing Tony Blair does. This is a good role for oppositions. Tony Blair does exactly what we did in the early 1980s: he restructures party policy, gets his party spokespeople to come out with policies well in advance, discusses them with the British people and refines them down to election day. It is not a matter of, `You will get our policies in the election.' It is a matter of, `You get our policies straight away. You have an opportunity to interact with those policies.' When the time comes to go to the polls, that emerges as a platform. That is what Tony Blair does. I know that and Laurie Oakes, I am afraid to say, did not. Helen Trinca got that analysis of Tony Blair wrong. Tony Blair happens to be a genuine opposition leader, not a tired, recycled opposition leader.

         In relation to the republic, it is the coalition which has a legitimate policy to include people in the review of our constitution after its operation for some 100 years. Our policy involves looking at the path that Australia correctly pursued in the 1890s when it originally formulated the constitution for the Commonwealth of Australia. It involves a fair dinkum people's convention and a fair dinkum set of questions being put to the people by way of a referendum. The coalition will have a referendum on the question of whether Australia should become a republic. Contrast that with Labor's approach that we have to cop it sweet, we have to cop its model of the republic, we will get no input into what that model will be and we can take it or leave it.

         I say to the House that what this country wants is fair dinkum leadership, in touch leadership. What it has, sadly, is the Prime Minister, a leader who goes around saying, `This is as good as it gets.' Fancy making that comment a few weeks ago when this day the Chamber of Manufactures has found that it has the need to speak of a further recession arising from the results of its most recent survey. I have to say this is not as good as it gets. It will get a whole lot better when we have John Winston Howard in the Lodge and a coalition government providing real leadership for this country—the sooner the better.

         —This motion should be seen for what it simply is—a shabby attempt by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), 12 years after the crime, to try to expunge the guilt of his own assault on families, communities and the Australian nation during his time as Treasurer. Throughout question time we have observed the coalition wallowing in the worst kind of hypocrisy. It has been very hypocritical over French nuclear testing. It has been hypocritical over economic policy by its failure to tell the Australian people its own policies, and now we have this motion criticising the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

         I note with some degree of interest that the honourable member for Bennelong said that it is sheer arrogance for the Prime Minister to come into this House and defend the rights of workers. We have that criticism coming from a second-rate leader who has been rejected three times by his own party and the Australian people. I think it is the height of arrogance for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this House with an appalling economic record from his own time in opposition and make these charges against the Prime Minister. It is even more arrogant coming from a man who cannot even bring himself to countenance an Australian as an Australian head of state.

         The Leader of the Opposition completely forfeits any right to speak on this particular matter of public importance before the House today. He has levied the charge against the Prime Minister and the government that the Australian people are coming second under the Prime Minister's stewardship. Is he talking about the long-term unemployed, who have been the recipients of the caring resources that have been put at their disposal to bring them back into the work force by the Prime Minister and the government through the Working Nation program? Is he talking about the Aboriginal people, who can now walk with pride in the wake of the Mabo legislation, which has been brought to this House by the government and opposed at every step by a weak-kneed leader who could not keep the rednecks in Western Australia under control?

         We know exactly how the Leader of the Opposition is handling the policy debate. It was done in Victoria by Jeff Kennett. Kennett made a promise to the Victorian work force and to individuals, families and communities that are the subject of this MPI here today. He made the promise that no worker would be worse off when the Kennett government came to power. After a massive assault on the social wage and on the living standards of workers, represented by an increase in taxes of $1,200 per family, we finally found out the real policies and the real agenda of the opposition. It gets worse than that because the honourable member for Bennelong will not even tell his own backbenchers. How can you hold a brainstorming session when you have nothing on the table and you will not even tell your own backbench what the policies are?

         The Prime Minister is a family man. He has successfully raised a family of four while devoting his political life to the welfare of the working people of this nation. What possible construction could the opposition put on this MPI accusing the Prime Minister of causing pain to Australian families and Australian communities? During his whole political life, the Prime Minister has been the architect, the weaver of the fabric, of the social wage, which has been the rock of support on which low income earners and working families have pinned their hopes for a decent standard of living in this country.

That has been the hallmark of the Prime Minister's life—an untiring and unswerving dedication to the improvement of the living standards of all Australians. That concern was reflected in the budget that he, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) crafted recently, which was delivered to the Australian people and the nation.

The effect on the average family, rather than glazing your eyes over, should make your hair stand on end. If you have a mortgage, if you owe money on your bankcard or if you owe money on your overdraft, then you are paying more as a result of the massive indebtedness which has been built up by the failure of this government's economic policy over the last 12 years.

The member for Flinders says he has found one instance in the years between 1988 and now in which we have had question time on a day when parliament has sat after the normal time. He found one precedent. That is one time we have done it. There have been many times in the past when we have not done it.

         What the member for Flinders ought to remember, and what the Australian public should know, is that the only reason we will be here tomorrow spending the Australian taxpayers' money is the slothfulness, laziness and downright opportunism of his colleagues in the Senate. In his remarks, he said that we will be here tomorrow only for a clean-up operation. That is right. The reason the House is sitting tomorrow is that the Liberal and National senators, at the behest of their leader and the member for Flinders, will not do their job.

         They spent the first part of this week mucking around with everything, and most of last week just talking about their own internal problems. We had a three-quarter of an hour diatribe one day from Senator Crichton-Browne on why the member for Flinders, as deputy leader, was no good and how he was going to see the member for Flinders off. This is the way the National Party and the Liberal Party want to spend time wasting the taxpayers' money in the Senate. So the House of Representatives has to sit another day to wait for important legislation to come back.

The member for Flinders says that we should go back to the good old days when former Prime Minister Fraser was sitting in the chair that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) is sitting in. Unlike the member for Flinders, because he was never actually here when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister,

          I recall Mr Fraser being here as Prime Minister. For anyone to suggest that he spent a lot of time in this chamber answering questions is a joke. What Prime Minister Fraser used to do was to turn the Prime Minister's chair 90 degrees so that his back was turned to Speaker Snedden, whom he despised, and he would then look around the chamber. When a member of the opposition asked him a question, he would point to one of his blockheaded ministers, and that minister would get up and answer the question—not the Prime Minister.

         When we were in opposition, we used to say, `We want to hear from the butcher, not the block.' But every time a question was asked, the block would get up and answer the questions because the butcher would just sit here. They were all dead scared of him. But he was never going to answer questions. So I do not think any of us would like to go back to the good old days of Prime Minister Fraser who treated the parliament with an arrogance that we had never seen before and will never see again.

I was paired today so I could be present when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) farewelled a group of veterans who were being sent to New Guinea. Although it is a quite expensive exercise, I believe it is a very generous gesture and I am very supportive of it. It is interesting that, having made that gesture, the Prime Minister hardly got a round of applause after his speech. One would have thought the mere fact that those people were being sent on that trip would have been enough to get an applause.

I just want to put it on the record that it was the coolest reception I have ever seen a Prime Minister get, let alone when he is sending people on a freebie to New Guinea. But the point is that we are not debating whether we should sit tomorrow. We welcome it. We are asking that this government conduct the orders of the day in the proper and traditional fashion, and that is by including question time.

It is a process by which the government of the day, whatever its political persuasion, is kept honest and answerable to the people of Australia. That is what it is there for. As such, every day this House sits, the government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to extend that privilege to them so they can go to bed at night with some confidence that the government has been put under proper scrutiny and is conducting its affairs in an acceptable manner.

We cannot rewrite history in this place because it is all on the record. The government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), just made a statement that Malcolm Fraser had a practice in this place whereby he referred all questions delivered to him to his frontbench. I was here for 2 1/2 years of that period and I remember that happening once. What I do not remember happening is a question being directed to a frontbencher and the Prime Minister showing so little confidence in that person as to take the question himself, which I have observed on numerous occasions here since Mr Keating has been the Prime Minister. He has shown an absolute lack of confidence in his ministers and has taken questions himself.

We will continue to oppose those measures which we believe you have no mandate for, but we think the people of Australia are entitled to the tradition of a question time. I think it is a shame on the government that there is such an arrogant disregard of question time and its normal proceedings. We ask ministers questions which embarrass them on one day and, the next day, they are not here to follow up their answers. That situation is unbelievable—we were promised that it would not happen. Putting that aside, we should have a question time tomorrow. In closing I want to ask the government one simple question: what are you frightened of?

          It will be futile for governments to fight rearguard actions against change, but there can be substantial benefits in seeking to understand the directions where already apparent trends are leading. The committee's report on the work force of the future examines demographic, economic and labour market developments and makes recommendations for government to assist workers and employers to adapt to structural and social change. The past 21 years have been marked by striking changes in the composition of the Australian labour market.

          For reasons that are not entirely clear, the year 1974 stands out in international labour force statistics as marking a sudden end to what has been called `the golden age of full employment' which ran for 30 years from the end of World War II. A variety of explanations have been put forward including the impact of the oil shock of 1973; general use of the contraceptive pill, which changed the whole pattern of fertility and led to increased female labour force participation; a loss of confidence in government intervention, Keynesian style, in the economy, leading to a revival of neoclassical economic theory and practice; and a clear indication of the post-industrial phenomenon with sharp declines in manufacturing employment, now down to 14 per cent, and demand for manual labour.

          Before 1974 Australia's unemployment rate was one of the world's lowest, far lower than that of the United States or Britain. Since 1974 it has generally been higher than that of the US, and sometimes higher than that of Britain. However, our wage levels have maintained value better than in the US.

          The committee emphasises that the composition of the 1995 labour force is radically different from that of 1974. Since 1974 female participation in the labour force has increased from 41 to 51 per cent. The post-war Beveridge-Chifley concept of full employment being defined as `one adult breadwinner per family' has been overtaken by events.

          Another important development has been the growth of part-time work. In 1973 only 12 per cent of workers were employed part time. By 1993 this had doubled to 24 per cent. A high proportion of part-time jobs are performed by young people between 15 and 24 years of age and by married women. The number of jobs created in Australia between 1973 and 1993 was 1.8 million, or a growth of 32 per cent. However, over a million of those jobs were part time, which was an increase of 164 per cent in part-time employment.

          Largely due to these factors, Australia, in common with most OECD nations, is now experiencing the unprecedented phenomenon of high employment and high unemployment simultaneously. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. All it means is that many of those, mostly males, who were traditionally in work are now out of it and unlikely to return while those, mostly women, who were traditionally not in work are now in it.

          Apart from the high employment-high unemployment paradox, the age and gender composition of the labour force has changed dramatically. So has the length of working life, at a time of increasing life expectancy in Australia and most comparable economies. The 35-year working lifetime is likely to become the norm, replacing the 50-year model. Many more jobs have been created but, at the same time, labour force participation rates have never been greater. At 63.7 per cent, they have stayed close to their historic highest levels since 1974.

          While the composition of the labour force has changed, a revolution in the work force has also occurred. Far more people work with telephones and computers than with traditional tools.

The regional impact of employment changes is extremely varied.

          Along with changes to tools and techniques, there have been far reaching shifts in the leading employment sectors in Australia. Since 1974, the fastest growing employment sector has been the information related employment sector—including the whole range of media and entertainment, market research, consulting, administrative, management, clerical, education and financial services. This sector is estimated at 42.5 per cent of the labour force.

          The committee took on Peter Drucker's important argument about the decline of hierarchical work, that management structures have been flattened out. He argues that the coming post-industrial society is `the first in which not everybody does the same work. This is far more than a social change. It is a change in the human condition'. In a knowledge society, having a hundred or a thousand people performing the same task, as was characteristic of agriculture or manufacturing, would be pointless.

          The committee also drew attention to the formation of dual labour markets. The primary labour market is characterised by high skill levels, comparative security of employment and a full range of award related working conditions. The secondary labour market may be characterised by insecure work, low skill levels and a deteriorating range of award coverage. There is also increased wage disparity between the primary and the secondary labour markets.

          The domestic services and tourism and hospitality sectors are where most new jobs are now being created. Some 55 per cent of all work is estimated to be unpaid or informal work, once almost exclusively done by women, now increasingly outsourced. Evidence to the committee indicated that an additional two million potential jobs were waiting to be created by outsourcing services such as food preparation and delivery, home maintenance and gardening, cleaning, security and child minding. Of course, such outsourcing would be dependent on the restoration of the two income family with higher levels of discretionary spending. Australia is now exporting a range of services, including tourism, educational, financial, legal, marketing and management consultancy services. But we still import more services than we export.

          Other areas where employment growth and wealth generation may be expected to occur include a number of industrial sectors such as construction, mining and value added manufacturing, together with agriculture—especially value added horticultural exports—information technology, knowledge related information services, health related services and tourism. The unprecedented growth of the information and quasi-domestic services sectors of the economy has led to the displacement of one group of workers and its replacement by another group. There is now a relatively high demand for skilled and professional workers and a relatively low demand for unskilled workers.

          Across a wide variety of white-collar occupations, new computer technology enables some workers to attempt more creative or intellectually demanding tasks. There are now fewer opportunities for process related and middle management white-collar workers.

          There has been high growth in the low skilled part-time hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy.

          The changes outlined in the committee's report have caused substantial dislocation in the lives of many workers. The challenge for any government is to ease the impact of the process. As we said in paragraph 1.21, recognising that outsourcing will be a major contribution to employment, the committee recommends the government examine measures which may facilitate tendencies to outsource work from the home, government administration and industry, including primary industry.

          As we wrote in paragraph 2.31, one of Australia's greatest economic problems, although insufficiently recognised, is the inventory problem. This is the conspicuous lack of an inventory of brand name goods for which there is international recognition and demand, leading to a willingness to pay a premium price. Canada also lacks such an inventory, which is in significant contrast to Sweden, with Volvo, Saab, SKL and L. M. Ericsson; Finland, with Kone and Nokia; the Netherlands, with Philips and Shell; and the Republic of Korea, with Hyundai, Gold Star and Daewoo. All of those countries have such an inventory.

          I have already pointed to the tendency towards labour force demarcation between high skilled jobs with high pay and low skilled jobs often with low pay. High skilled jobs require an educated work force that is adaptable and flexible and which can acquire new knowledge quickly. Not all workers can possess those qualities. Governments must ensure that those who do not are not marginalised and are provided with opportunities to participate in the economy in a productive way.

          Access to information technology for all is essential if Australia is not to be divided into the information rich and the information poor. The committee repeats its 1991 recommendation that the government adopt a national information policy which sets out a series of principles which anticipates the social, economic and cultural implications of the information revolution rather than having decisions made piecemeal, on the run, responding to situations such as the adoption of new technologies or changes in ownership suddenly arising.

          The committee notes that those countries which have moved to a high-tech knowledge based economy have also been most successful in creating employment. According to EPAC and the Hilmer report, at present Australia's efficiency levels in the business sector are 10 to 15 per cent below the average for OECD countries, and the average Australian enterprise operates at 30 per cent below world best practice. It is recognised that the priority for industry must be to improve competitiveness and productivity in order to succeed. At the same time, Australia must stimulate market demand for its goods and services by building up a high value added inventory.

This is not just a formality; it is my deeply felt attitude. At all times, since the committee was created five years ago this month, the chairman has sought, and I believe has always obtained, a parliamentary attitude to whatever subject we were studying.

I hope there is a change in committee attitudes in the next parliament. No government can survive if it determines what parliamentary committees shall talk about.

         The committee recommends that the concept of mandatory retirement . . . be abolished, but that voluntary retirement for both males and females should be possible without reference to gender differentiation.
        </para>
        <para>
         I think that is a very significant point to be made. The other point to be made is in recommendation 7.42, which states:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that policies be developed to recognise the significance of the `third aged', to assist them to maintain their independence outside institutions as long as possible, and to promote the contribution of volunteers.
        </para>
        <para>
         These are significant recommendations because there is sound work in the report to support them. Recommendation 7.61 of the report states:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Committee recommends that the Government investigate ways to enable workers to be able to phase down working hours before retirement without loss of superannuation benefits.
        </para>
        <para>
         Again, I commend this report not only to members of this House but to people who work in this building, to see how significant these recommendations are. It has been a pleasure  serving with this committee, and I hope it continues until March 1996.

In the course of my speech I detailed the extraordinary difficulty I was having in getting any information at all with respect to a particular government program operating in my electorate. I said that the trail of trying to find out what was happening in my electorate—a perfectly reasonable request for information—ended with the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), where I had been directed by the department.

I was informed that my request for information, for details about new work opportunities programs in Moncrieff, had to be put in writing to the minister and then I would get an answer.

He was very angry indeed, because one could ascribe some quite evil motives to a story like that. When I was told the story and I laughed, I said, `They are going to be disappointed when I don't die, aren't they?' That was my reaction to it.

I was at a loss to understand this myself, and I was certainly at a loss to explain it to her. In fact, many people in the community are asking the very same question—that is, how the federal government can provide legal assistance to someone when the matter is in a state jurisdiction.

         Tony Barrass had a very snide article in the inside cover of yesterday's paper in reference to a document which I lodged in this parliament on the previous day. His account is full of inaccuracies and it clearly indicates that he takes the matter about which he wrote very lightly.

Mr Barrass also stated that this man appealed to the Supreme Court and the High Court, and that the charges stuck like glue. That too is not true, as a lot of his evidence was not even admitted in the High Court.

         He also tried to paint a disparaging picture of a man whom I hold in the highest regard—David Macdonald, who did this painstaking work for me. He has many inaccuracies there too. Mr Macdonald resigned from the police force. Out of the blue, two days before his resignation was due to take place, he was charged with five offences going to corruption and stealing. When these five cases went to court, he was simply viewed as having no case to answer by the magistrate, who threw the whole lot out and had some very caustic things to say about the charging. It was an example of the very thing I have been complaining about in Western Australian circles.

          However, by and large Australians are held in pretty high regard in France. In fact, for a long time, Australians have enjoyed a fair amount of popularity when the subject of Australia and Australians has been raised amongst ordinary French people. It is interesting to note that, when one visits France or speaks to French people, they do generally feel that Australians and French have a number of empathetic views.

          There is a tremendous opportunity for the protests of the Australian community to be brought home not just at the very high level of President Chirac and the French government but also more closely and more directly to the French people themselves. In view of this high standing that Australians have enjoyed, and the tremendous standing in which Australian sports men and women are held by the French community, and reflecting on the contribution made by Australian servicemen and servicewomen during the First World War and the Second World War on French soil, one can see that there is an opportunity for the Australian government to initiate a comprehensive program within France itself of informing the French people of the opposition of the Australian people to these tests.

          It is my view, on a positive note, that the Australian government could do this by initiating a program of public relations within the French media, both print and electronic, to show just how strongly the Australian people feel about the tests. It is something that can be done relatively cheaply, and in a little more compelling and influential way than has been the case in dealing with the French President himself.

          On a local note, I would like to congratulate a couple in my electorate who have just enjoyed their 50th wedding anniversary. The reason for bringing them to the attention of the House of Representatives is that they have been very prominent community activists for a long time in the electorate. I refer to Charlie and Beth Bail, who were amongst the first people to settle in the new suburb of Heathridge some 15 to 16 years ago. Since then they have played a very important and substantial role in the local community, particularly in the activities of the Red Cross and in raising money for the Australian Red Cross in the local area.

But, in the case of Charlie and Beth Bail, they have been very strong pioneering participants in the northern suburbs of my electorate. When the area of Heathridge was being developed—an area at the northerly tip of the northern suburbs—they played a very important role in establishing a close-knit community. I would like to pass on my warmest congratulations on their 50th wedding anniversary last Friday. I would also pass on my thanks to their daughter, Margaret Long, for keeping me informed of this important event in the community.

          —Tonight I too wish to speak briefly in regard to the French nuclear tests in the Pacific and the reaction to that announcement in my electorate of Bass. There is no doubt that the will of Australians is starkly against the resumption of this testing. A rally was held in Civic Square, Launceston last Saturday against the resumption of these tests. At this rally I circulated a petition with the following wording:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread community outrage throughout our nation at the decision of the French government to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to note and endorse the concerns expressed in this petition and convey to the French parliament in the strongest terms Australia's opposition to this decision. We ask further that the House call upon the government of France to reverse its position and abandon completely any further nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
        </para>
        <para>
         That petition, with its 312 signatures collected in a very short time at that rally, has been submitted by me today and will be tabled in the House at our next sitting. That rally and this petition were things which united all political interests in Launceston. The rally itself was organised by the Tasmanian Greens and, although Bob Brown's speech was a plea to elect him to the Senate, at least it was an issue which he cared about and which Launceston cared about.

          My own petition was in fact signed by none other than my political opponent Warwick Smith. I can assure you that the battle for Bass is a tough one. It must have taken a great deal of effort for him to bring himself to sign a petition of mine, but nonetheless he did. I commend him for it. The point I make is that Australian abhorrence to French nuclear testing cuts across all—I repeat all—political boundaries. In the electorate of Bass, this is no different.

         —I would like to advise the House in this adjournment debate that tomorrow I most certainly will be voting against—I have officially informed the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)—the Competition Policy Reform Bill, which I think is one of the most pernicious pieces of legislation that I will see in my lifetime come into an Australian parliament. I seem to be very isolated in that viewpoint on both sides of the House, although I suspect that there are many people sitting opposite who would agree very strongly with my point of view. I suspect there are a number of people on my side of the House who would oppose very strongly the legislation.

         We have seen how the EBOs have worked. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes in this place and skites about the EBOs. It appears to me to be a mechanism by which the wages of the average Australian will be driven down. We continuously hear the phrase `world best practice' in this place and in other places. Quite frankly, world best practice is South American and South African wage levels. A lot of people that are imposing this upon us are companies and corporations that have mines in South Africa, employing South Africans who come over here, and South American companies that are now operating in Australia. When people talk about world best practice and they put into effect mechanisms such as the EBOs, may the Lord help the workers of Australia.

         In my home state, we have already seen massive strikes. We have seen the worst strike in the last 20 years in the sugar industry and the worst strike in the last 20 years in the mining industry. These were through EBOs. Disruptions are taking place. In Queensland we have seen average weekly earnings go down in the last three years, which is probably the first time since the Second World War. They were already the lowest in Australia. Queensland is particularly susceptible to the deregulatory policies of this government. A statutory marketing authority as an arrangement is an industrial award for farmers. We have seen those smashed to pieces right across the board.

         Let us have a look at these wonderful, clever people who are imposing this bill upon the Australian public. All of the conditions, pay and arrangements that have been fought over for 20, 30, 40, maybe even 100 years of Australian history are being swept away. Statutory marketing of wool was swept away and we saw the income from wool drop from $6,000 million a year to about $2,500 million a year. We lost $3,200 million per year in the wool industry alone, including about a third of our wool growers. The nation's greatest asset was the sheep herd, and now a third of that asset has gone.

         Another area of the economy we deregulated was petrol marketing. It was estimated by the MTAQ at one stage that around 500 service stations a year were closing. Most certainly, over 1,000 service stations and small proprietors went broke and went out of business in that period of time. So the small businessmen were wiped out and, as a result, the oil companies had a far greater grip on the Australian marketplace. The net result has been that, although the world price of oil has dropped by half, the price in Australia, in the same period of time, has more than doubled. That is costing the Australian public about $5,400 million per year every year—another great victory for deregulation.

Of course, that does not account for the estimated $70,000 million to $100,000 million that was taken off the Australian public, with interest rates in excess of 20 per cent, to try to rescue the banks for the money they threw away under the deregulatory policies of this government. So the dead are many. If this proceeds, the pharmacists, taxi drivers, milk vendors, newsagents, hoteliers and sugar farmers will be wiped out.

        Reference to traditional Australia and the distinguishing spirit which embodied the population conjures images of survivors, people who would continue struggling against the elements. National pride resides with explorers, pioneers and those who fought for Australia's independence, providing the romantic yet tragic picture of those at Gallipoli who were willing to die for their mates. On these qualities has Australia been built and to the courage and personality of previous populations we owe our modern lifestyle as we know it. Success and prosperity has been achieved through not simply the battlers, but their unifying distinctive disposition which forces future generations to acknowledge the presence of and benefits of emulating such traits.

        Quenton continues:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In the light of a changing society, resulting alterations to ethics and standards, and new international directions, one significant aspect of Australia's population is multiculturalism and the continuing expansion of this trend. This raises intriguing issues such as whether the traditional Australian ethos still exists and functions in a modern urban, multicultural society, whether the state of our society dictates the need for a reviewed and updated ethos or whether the individual successfully contributes to the nation's prosperity without the need for a linking characteristic between races, religions and cultures.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        The diversity of cultures present in Australia's society has led to governmental policies granting equality as a right all citizens should be able to claim. This played a significant role in improving the attitudes of society towards all races, most significantly towards Australia's indigenous people, the Aborigines. An increased awareness towards inter-racial relationships helps towards a peaceful established level of functioning in which society should be a representation of national law.

          —I am rising to speak today on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder. There are years in which I personally have fought shoulder to shoulder with the environment movement on the Ben Lomond uranium mine. I think that my involvement in the fight over getting on stream the big uranium mine at Ben Lomond was instrumental in stopping it from coming on stream. There were a number of actions by the French mining company which reflected the same sort of attitude that the French are showing now. In fact, the manager at Ben Lomond resigned at the time over the irresponsible attitude of the French mining company at Ben Lomond.

          I fought alongside the environment movement again in the area of North Queensland which is very similar to the situation of Lake Pedder, the Downey Creek area. I thought that it was very wrong to log what was a virgin rainforest area, and I fought very hard and publicly against my own government to try to stop the logging at Downey Creek.

          On a number of occasions in the past I have found myself involved on that side. I had a lot to do with a lot of the people in the environmental movement when we instituted the first stand-alone solar energy system on Coconut Island in the Torres Strait. The town there was, in my day, totally looked after by solar energy. I supported that not because I wanted to be particularly clever or imaginative, but just because it happened to be the cheapest way of doing it. The incoming state government spent $8 million more of the taxpayers' money to put in the primitive diesel generators throughout the rest of the Torres Strait, and set this country back some 20 years in that area.

          But increasingly, now, the environmental movement seems to be taking an extreme position that takes no cognisance of the destruction wrought upon the rest of the community. It takes no cognisance of the pain imposed upon literally millions of people in Australia who cannot find a permanent job. I quote from the book by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), not from my own fund of knowledge. He says the real unemployment figure is 16 1/2 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, the member for Fraser showed a lot of courage and integrity in taking the position he did in his very outstanding book; and once again, even though he is known as a very strong environmentalist, he has taken a very strong and courageous position here. It is one of considerable integrity. Obviously there are no votes for him in Canberra in making the decision this way, whereas there might have been a few if he had gone in the other direction.

          The proposal to drain Lake Pedder takes away the one advantage poor little Tasmania has got. When members go through all of the poverty indicators, as I did this week, Queensland leaps out in front on almost every single example; but undoubtedly Tasmania is neck and neck with Queensland in the poverty stakes for Australia, and this would take away from this little island state one of the great advantages that is has. The electricity system is really something that the rest of the world should look at.

          I spoke to a person who is very high up in the electricity industry in Queensland. I cannot mention his name, because he would probably get sacked if I did. He said to me, `I'm completely out of line with the electricity decision makers throughout Australia. I believe small is beautiful, not big is beautiful; but I wouldn't expect you to understand that.' I said, `On the contrary, I went to Tasmania and I was absolutely staggered. As you drive along there is a one-megawatt generator here, a three-megawatt generator there, and a five-megawatt generator there.' In Queensland, anyone who talks about anything under 250-megawatt generators is regarded as a Martian. I am quite sure that that would be the same in Victoria or New South Wales.

          We went to the aluminium smelter there, and the people there were telling us all about how it operates. I said, `But what if you have a strike or some disruption to your electricity supply?' The people of Brisbane went for two weeks without a power supply until we had to go in and do what was a very dirty job—one of the ugliest jobs that I have ever had to do—and sack half the industry to get the power turned back on in Brisbane. I said, `What happens if you have a stoppage?' and they said, `We do not have those here.'

          A system comprising hydro-electric generators, the biggest of which is 40 megawatts, is a system that is almost unassailable by anyone. An oppressive government might want to use electricity to raise finance. For example, the Queensland government has done this through a sneaky little trick: it has added two per cent taxation on electricity. It has been the only government in Australia to do that. But that is centralised control.

          Solar energy has such great appeal to so many people because it is a freedom thing. People can rig up their tents anywhere they like and they do not have to worry very much about anyone else. The cost of the excessiveness of the environmental movement is graphically illustrated by this ridiculous proposal. In North Queensland, at the present moment, there is a good chance that we will never get 1,500 jobs: there is the Rainbow Harbour project; the Palm Cove project; the East Trinity Inlet project; and one other project, which I cannot remember. There are four in Cairns. In my own electorate, south of Cairns, there are 250 jobs at Clump Point, 30 at Mission Park, 70 at Kirrima, 1,100 at Port Hinchinbrook, 40 at Dungeness, and 70 at Secret Harbour. That is a grand total of 3,000 jobs that these people are costing us.

In fact, I think they take very great risks when they go into certain areas now in North Queensland because the level of hatred has got quite out of control against them.

          I went to Herberton where World Heritage has taken away all the forestry jobs. There were 23 people in the pub that night and not a single one of them had a job in Herberton. These people are trying to feed their kids. They have no family life. The jobs have been taken away from them by people who are indulging themselves with excessive behaviour. This is illustrated graphically by this rather outrageous proposal to drain Lake Pedder.

He was looking down the gun barrel of bankruptcy. This particular bloke had lost his job. It had been taken away from him because of the cutbacks on main roads by the Queensland government and by the federal government. The week before that he had a job with his brother.

          My electorate is the heartland of the fish and prawn farming industries of Australia. The comparable countries of Taiwan and Japan are looking at $2,000 million and $3,000 million a year of production from their prawn and fish farming industries. When I became northern development minister, there was not a single prawn or fish farm operating in Queensland and, as I understand it, in Australia. I am proud to say that we have leapt ahead. I do not want to claim the credit there. The person responsible for getting the industry going was the appointee of the present government, Dr Joe Baker. He was an outstanding appointment to Landcare and I must praise the current Keating government for appointing him to that position. By the time we were finished, from a standing start, within about seven or eight years, we were bringing in $30 million or $40 million.

          Right now some $40, $50 or $60 million should be coming in and only about $25 million—I think that would be a fair figure—is coming in from prawn and fish farming. The reason for that is that every single attempt to build a pond in North Queensland has been opposed by the green movement and the green movement has been listened to by government decision makers. When I say `government decision makers', that would be the most ridiculous exaggeration that I have made in this place because any relationship between them and decision making would be purely coincidental.

The fact that the split in the polls in Queensland is 62 to 38 reflects the attitude of the working class to a government that will listen to academics from the universities in Queensland and layabouts on fat government jobs in the cities but will not listen to people living in the areas concerned.

          Harking back to the gentleman I met when I was riding on his backhoe going down the main street during the demonstration, he said, `You know, it's really heartbreaking because our daughter was hoping to get a job at Port Hinchinbrook and she's had to leave town. She's gone down to Brisbane. We've lost our daughter and our son left last week. So we've lost our son as well.' There were tears in his eyes when he said that.

          Those are not my words. They are the words of the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss—`Faulkner's mud hole'. A kilometre of coastline was cleared eight years ago and it will stay cleared for another eight years. It has absolutely no vegetation on it whatsoever. It is eroding out into the ocean and doing untold environmental damage, yet Senator Faulkner has decided to keep that situation as is because he has been listening to absolute imbeciles who clearly have no love for their country. Anyone who had any love for their country would demand that that area be rejuvenated. There is no way in the world the Goss government is going to rejuvenate that area, and the federal government is not either.

          —That is what I am saying. The proposal by the green movement is to take this away. I am trying to illustrate the absolute outrageousness of the proposal in the first place. People from Tasmania may not have a view such as mine, but the fact that something like 95 per cent of the Australian population lives within 30 or 40 miles of water would indicate that people love to live near water. To take water away from an area to make it more beautiful is something that I simply do not understand.

          To come to the aesthetics, 95 per cent of the Australian people prefer to have water than not to have water there. Most certainly the Tasmanian population says, `If we can get cheap, clean, power from hydro-electricity schemes, then let's do it.' I am not saying that we should do it in some of the mainland areas, because we need that water badly for irrigation. If there is a choice, the water should go there rather than be used for energy creation, but in Tasmania it gives aluminium as simply congealed electricity. If we have cheap electricity, we have an advantage over the rest of the world. The reason why so much of it is done in Canada and New Zealand is to give those countries cheap hydro-electric power. If we do not have cheap hydro-electric power, if we drain Lake Pedder, we will have no cheap power and this little state—which is doing it so hard and so courageously—would not be given the opportunity to expand the aluminium industry which is being contemplated at the present moment.

           Inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder

          . I was not a member of that committee but as a Tasmanian I thought it was incumbent upon me to give evidence. Having given evidence to the committee and having Lake Pedder in my electorate, I naturally have a great personal interest. I know I should adequately reflect the views of my constituents on this somewhat controversial issue for Tasmania and for the rest of Australia.

          This issue of draining and restoring Lake Pedder to its original state, like the forestry issue, has polarised views in Tasmania but, unlike forestry, we have seen a clearer and more easily definable polarisation. In my view and in the view of most Tasmanians, this inquiry should never have proceeded in the first place. If the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, had asked the five members of the House of Representatives and the 12 senators who represent Tasmania, I think he would have had almost unanimous support, apart from Senator Devereux and perhaps Senator Coates, for this inquiry not proceeding in the first place. But ministers being ministers they do not usually consult people in the states that they intend to have some impact on.

          The findings of the committee were those that have been espoused by most people, apart from the dark greens. The dark greens have their own agenda to ensure that they can achieve maximum media coverage for their own electoral gain. It is interesting to note the results of a survey carried out by the

          in Tasmania on 26 June, a couple of nights ago. One thousand people across Tasmania were surveyed about whether they thought Lake Pedder should be drained. The overall result for Tasmania was 89 per cent voting no and 6.5 per cent voting yes. Of those surveyed, 95 per cent of Liberals and 90 per cent of Labor voted no. Of the green component only 22 per cent of greens among the 1,000 people said it should be drained. Surprisingly, 66 per cent of those who had green allegiance said to leave it as it is.

          That the minister bowed to pressure and agreed to this inquiry is, as I say, regrettable. Apart from educating members of the committee and closing this issue, hopefully once and forever, in my mind and in the minds of a vast majority of Tasmanians it has been an absolute waste of taxpayers' money.

          During the inquiry it has been interesting to note the claims and counterclaims made by the proponents and opponents of this proposal. Perhaps those on the committee and the public at large across Australia can now better understand the difficulties faced by those of us who represent our constituencies in these controversial parts of Australia when we are faced, inevitably in this day and age, with these environmental issues. You can never win, whatever you say, and you are damned if you do and you are damned if you don't. It is a case of agreeing with the umpire if the decision goes your way but disagreeing vehemently if the umpire's decision is not what you see as the right and proper decision.

          Christine Milne, the Tasmanian leader of the Greens, said that the federal committee report was a safe, popular and politic decision but one that was cowardly and contradicted its own findings. When I made my own submission to the inquiry, I said that I was opposed to the damming of the original Lake Pedder. I marched with the many thousands against it. We were, as were many others on their trips to the west coast of Tasmania in those rather turbulent days in the 1970s, forced to remove the `No dam' stickers from our cars, to save them from being vandalised in the towns on the west coast which were very pro dam.

However, we live not in the 1970s but in 1995, and we have the present Lake Pedder to consider, a huge lake covering 242 square kilometres. I call it a lake and not a dam—unlike the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who wrongly asserts that we should call it Dam Pedder. I would ask the member for Dunkley to look at some of the names given to other such structures around the world, and see how many of those are called dams rather than lakes.

          Over the past 20 years, the large Lake Pedder has developed its own ecosystem, the flora and fauna adapting to the new lake's surrounds. It is a beautiful lake, nestling in a World Heritage area. Granted, it is not as scenic as the original one, but it still possesses its own unique beauty. It is visited by tourists and used by recreational fishermen, and is a source of wonderment in that part of my electorate. The lake is also an integral and significant part of the Tasmanian hydro-electric network. If the lake were ever drained, it would have an adverse effect on the capacity of power generation for all Tasmanians.

          Certainly, this Lake Pedder inquiry has been a very interesting one for the members of the committee. I do not think I have ever participated in an inquiry which has had before it such diametrically opposed evidence. I do not know how we could have had one witness after another come forward with evidence which contained such enormous contrasts. Indeed, it was hard, on many occasions, to come to any other conclusion than that some of the witnesses had allowed their emotional attachments to the issue to cloud their judgment. Frankly, it is just not possible, in many instances, to find a common harmonious thread through the evidence that was received.

          There is room for differing opinions on many issues. Even in costing the worth of electricity, there are various methodologies that can be used. The committee received evidence that the value of the power that would be lost if Lake Pedder were to be drained was as different as $0 and $27.8 million per annum. The future value of electricity from Lake Pedder was put at between $0 and $450 million per annum. Those are enormous disparities. The real figure may be somewhere in between, but it is not possible to accept that all that evidence is accurate. Should Lake Pedder be drained, the cost of rehabilitation was put at both $0 and in excess of $2 billion dollars.

          Lake Pedder is in an attractive area of the globe. The old Lake Pedder was a very beautiful area. Some people regarded it as one of the wonders of the world. It is also beyond dispute that the enlarged lake is an attractive area. If you want to dispute which is the more beautiful, that is largely in the eye of the beholder. Certainly, it is the surrounds of the lake which make it a wilderness. The enlarged lake enhances the area of water, but it has covered areas which were considered by many to have great wilderness value.

          I have to admit that, as somebody who had not been to Lake Pedder before this inquiry, the image that I had of Lake Pedder was very different from the reality. I had seen the beautiful posters. I had an idea that Lake Pedder was surrounded by dense jungle—temperate rainforests and the like. It came as a surprise to me when I went there to find that the area largely comprised button grass plains. The large trees that I had envisaged were nowhere to be seen. There were only a few tangled bushes.

          In a sense, the media have succeeded in portraying an image of Lake Pedder that is a long way from the reality. Fraser Island in my electorate is similarly portrayed.

          So there is a public image of Lake Pedder which is a long way from the reality. The posters that are widely distributed these days by the Pedder 2000 supporters display a very beautiful picture, but it is a scene that would have been seen by very few Australians. However, even if the original Lake Pedder were there today, very few visitors to the area would ever see it the way the pictures portray it. To begin with, it rains for something like 300 days of the year, and it would be a rare occasion for visitors to see it with blue skies.

Generally speaking, it was only those who were brave enough to hike in by foot for many miles, through very rugged terrain and in unpleasant weather conditions, who saw it. So it was not the idyllic lake that is often portrayed.

          Indeed, the opportunity to see Lake Pedder has really only come about for most Australians and visitors from around the world because of the hydro-electricity schemes in the region. These schemes led to the construction of good all-weather roads that have enabled people to visit Lake Pedder in much larger numbers than in the past. So there has been a degree of imbalance in the way in which Lake Pedder has been portrayed to the people of the world. It was a beautiful area. It is still a beautiful area. It has tourism potential, and that tourism potential is likely to be enhanced as the years go by.

          —Let us get onto that key question, whether this lake is a critical element in the Tasmanian hydro-electric generation system. It needs to be emphasised that Lake Pedder is responsible for about 65 megawatts of electricity generation—and that general figure is agreed by the committee—of Tasmania's capacity of 1,173 megawatts. It is possible to argue that, at the present time, there is an oversupply in the Tasmanian system of about 60 megawatts so the system would not necessarily fail if Lake Pedder was not there. However, it needs to be remembered that, because the Tasmanian system is so totally dependent on hydro-electricity, Lake Pedder is very much a part of an integrated system. A water storage could not be removed from the system without it potentially having significant impact, particularly in times of dry weather. Lake Pedder is a very important part of the Gordon system, which is a very important part of the whole Tasmanian system.

          Let us now look at that overcapacity of 60 megawatts, because I think we need to put that into some degree of perspective. It is a very small overcapacity. There is a power station just outside the boundary of my electorate which produces more power than the entire Tasmanian system, and there are several others in the state of Queensland that have a similar capacity. Each unit at the Tarong power station produces 350 megawatts and Tasmania's entire spare capacity is only 60 megawatts. There is not the slightest doubt that Tasmania will grow into that capacity. Even though it may not be needed today, it certainly will be within a decade or so, and that is irrespective of whether any major new industry comes to Tasmania. Just the growth in general domestic use, and the normal industrial type growth that will occur in Tasmania, will see that 60 megawatts needed at some time in the future.

          The key element in Tasmania's future electricity needs is the Bell Bay plant operated by Comalco. That plant is critical to Tasmania's economy. It is responsible for about 1,600 jobs, 780 being directly employed at the Bell Bay aluminium refinery. Comalco is faced with a very difficult decision at Bell Bay in that it cannot continue the operation in its current form. If it is going to be internationally competitive, it will have to expand the facility. If the facility does not become internationally competitive, it will have to be closed. If Lake Pedder was drained, there is not the slightest doubt that Comalco would not go ahead with the expansion.

          The committee put the question to Comalco executives in black and white. The answer to the question was that, if Lake Pedder was drained, without any doubt, Comalco would close. In fairness, it has to be said that, even if Lake Pedder is not drained, Comalco could still close. But if a decision was made at any level to drain Lake Pedder, and reduce Tasmania's capacity to supply hydro-electricity, there is no doubt that Bell Bay would close. I think that fact alone was enough for the committee to come down and say that there should be no further advancement of any proposals to drain the lake.

          One of the critical arguments put forward by Pedder 2000 was that jobs lost through the closure of Bell Bay would be made up for by extra tourism. In fact, Pedder 2000 spoke about 600 new jobs being created in the tourism area. Frankly that figure is just beyond belief. It would mean that there would have to be enormous growth in tourism to Tasmania. I do not believe that a remote lake would generate that number of extra tourists to Tasmania.

          What has to be borne in mind is that the Pedder 2000 proposal also involves excluding tourists from any area too close to the lake. A lookout point 15 kilometres away from the lake is being offered. Now I just do not think that hundreds of thousands of tourists are going to come from around the world to look at Lake Pedder from 15 kilometres away. In that sort of context, these claims are barely credible. Indeed, the real basis of the proposal is that this area should be returned to wilderness, that it should have its wilderness values restored. An essential element of that is to exclude visitors—to have as few people there as possible. I think a case could be mounted that tourism numbers would actually decline, rather than grow, if Lake Pedder was to be drained.

          I have a problem with this whole idea of devoting large parts of our continent to wilderness areas. It really is the ultimate in environmental snobbery to suggest that vast areas should be preserved for all time and people should be excluded from them. I am all for the development of national parks, and even wilderness areas. But their essential value to mankind is greatly enhanced if people are allowed to still enjoy them. If we start having large areas that people are not allowed to enter, we have to really seriously look at the environmental values that we are setting for our nation.

          The other very important element that has been raised by other speakers is that even most environmentalists regard the draining of Lake Pedder as a low priority—even if it was technically feasible and even if it was a good idea environmentally. It is beyond doubt in my mind that there would be some cost. I am not prepared to put a figure on where, between the nought and two billion, that cost would be. But I am sure there would have to be some degree of human intervention to restore several hundred square kilometres to an acceptable environmental standard.

          Surely when you look around at the problems confronting our own nation, Tasmania in particular, or the globe, this will never be a high environmental priority. Surely land degradation is a more significant issue—and the greenhouse effect, and the implications of world population. When I look at problems like the spreading deserts of Africa, the land degradation in our own continent, projects like the Three Gorges Dam in China, which is proceeding without much environmental objection, they all have to have a much higher priority than venturing, in a risky proposal, to drain Lake Pedder. Frankly, I do not believe that will ever change. I believe there will always be higher priorities than draining Lake Pedder.

          In my view, the idea of draining Lake Pedder is one which has gained acceptance way beyond its merit. Dr Brown in particular has pursued this through the media. He has got a lot of assistance from the ABC, some of whose leading on-air personalities are actively associated with the Pedder 2000 campaign. I think much of the media coverage on this issue has lacked balance, particularly on the mainland. Dr Brown's comments on this report have also been quite extraordinary. To suggest that the committee gave his proposals any comfort at all is really beyond any kind of proper fair reading of the report. I believe that his suggestion that we have given him any sympathy is wrong.

          While the project is technically feasible, as are many of this type, it lacks environmental priority, it lacks public support, it is potentially expensive, it may or may not work, and there are enormous environmental and social consequences as a result.

          , I think the debate that we have seen in this Main Committee has been quite useful. I have come to the realisation that, having been a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts since 1987, I happen to be the longest continuously serving member of the committee. I have to say that in this, the 37th, parliament, the committee has confronted two inquiries that have been the most challenging it has had to confront, save the conclusion of the irradiation inquiry that was ongoing when I joined the committee. But the two inquiries that we have had before us during this parliament have been the most challenging that I have seen the committee deal with. The first, of course, was the community recreation sport facilities inquiry earlier in this parliament, and the second was this inquiry on Lake Pedder.

          A number of comments have been made in the media and, indeed, a number of comments have been made throughout the discussion of this report in this debate, indicating that people felt that the inquiry itself was a waste of time. I do not believe that an inquiry such as this can be seen as a waste of time. I regret that the Premier of the state of Tasmania has so strongly come out with that view. This is an inquiry that the committee first got back on 8 December. In just over six months, we have completed an inquiry. There were many questions that we might have gone and looked at in greater detail. There are many ways that we might have sought more resources to have a more detailed inquiry. But on balance, through the consensus view of the whole committee, including the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) who has a dissenting report, it was felt that it was in the best interests of the issue to conclude the inquiry as expeditiously as possible without undermining the integrity of the findings.

The fact that, besides the honourable member for Dunkley, the committee was able to come to an overwhelming majority view and present it in this report, indicates that there is a great strength not only in this committee but also in the committee system of the House of Representatives. Of course, there are issues that will always be controversial, that are best concluded and decided by split decisions. But this issue was so fundamentally important that it was necessary that people with views on both sides of the argument should attempt to come to the consensus view that is represented by the conclusions of the report.

          Speaking personally, I first had to be convinced that there was enough merit in the proposal to warrant the inquiry. After discussions, and after listening and viewing presentations by Pedder 2000, I came to the conclusion that this was something that warranted an investigation. But having listened to the evidence, having listened to the submissions that have been made to the members of the committee, I see that—for reasons I will try to outline—the conclusion reached by the committee is the valid conclusion for this moment.

          I will go through some of the issues and some of the arguments, The first is: is it possible? As a scientist, it was that question that attracted me to this proposal. It is something that the honourable member for Dunkley, in his dissenting report, goes to. The thought that we might be able to turn back and rectify what may have been a wrong decision back in the 1970s should capture people's excitement and should capture people's imagination. The committee clearly concluded that, in a geomorphological sense, the actual original lake could be returned. The bone of contention was the large area that is under water—basically, submerged button grass plains.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We had a lot of discussion about that. We had discussion about how much mud might be covering those plains. I am a member of the committee who believes that the rehabilitation and restoration—we had discussions about the different meanings of those words—of those plains is possible. I agree that it would be a scientific challenge to achieve proper rehabilitation but it is possible. In having come to that conclusion, I have to underline that that possibility would require a great deal of resources. Of course, if it was left, over a long time nature would in its own way rehabilitate. But if we were to leave it at that, we would not be doing the right thing by the proper institution of this proposal. I am not going to try to put a figure on the amount of resources that would be required—I know that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has, as an economist, been amused by the figures that have been bandied around in the debate about a whole host of issues—but it would be a large cost. Therefore, in looking at this proposal and where it might rate compared with the priorities of other important environmental projects that we need to contend with, it has to rank at the moment as a lower priority.

          Simply put, in an airport lounge recently I bumped into a prominent Australian who asked me what I was doing. When I informed him that I was involved in this inquiry, he said, `But surely we would be better off using the money to plant trees.' Even if we just look at it in simple terms in that way, it is easy to see how a number of the committee members came to a similar conclusion as I did: whilst the project may be worthwhile, at the moment there are definitely other priorities.

          The other fact that we have to face is that this proposal would need the majority support of the community. I say to the Tasmanian members who have entered this debate, some of whom have felt that the inquiry was a waste of time, that one reason it was not a waste of time was that many members of the committee, like me, only realised through this inquiry the type of controversy and the environmental politics in Tasmania that the discussion of this proposal led to. It was not the inquiry that created this controversy; it was the proposal. I hope that the report in some way defuses that controversy and can mean that people that are looking at this fairly will see that there are other proposals that they might put their energy to that need to be immediately addressed.

          There is some discussion about whether our report closes off the thought of restoring the original Lake Pedder forever. We can have the semantic argument about whether it does or does not. I am not sure whether it will be my children's generation—it may be their children's generation—but at some stage this proposal will be revisited. It will be revisited because people will continue to read the dissenting report of the honourable member for Dunkley and their imagination will be sparked by the sentiments of that report. But it will only happen when a whole host of conditions change. These are conditions that will not be challenges just for the Tasmanian people but will be challenges for the whole of Australia and for the whole of the international community. They will be about how we best use energy, how we best provide employment efficiently against energy uses, and how we best generate energy.

But that has to be taken in contrast with and comparison to the type of environmental benefit that might be achieved by doing other things with the areas that have been impounded.

          We began this inquiry on the basis that it is a statutory requirement that Australian citizens provide confidential personal information about their finances, their property or their health to government agencies, in order to gain benefits from those agencies. It is a process of trust. All members of this House would have, on occasions, struck individuals who are most reluctant to provide any personal information. Whilst those individuals want the benefits, they also have a great distrust of the bureaucratic processes of government, of personnel within government, and of the ultimate designs that governments may have on the records that they are required to give in order to gain health, social security or employment benefits, or even to be able to register for some form of entitlement in the future.

          Over the last few years, with the introduction of the tax file number, there has been a drawing together of records held by organisations such as Taxation, Social Security, Health. This involves a data matching process to ensure that people are being up-front and fair. In some ways, data matching has increased the level of distrust in the community as to whether the Commonwealth will carefully safeguard the information supplied by its citizens.

          We have looked at all of those things and we have come forward with a fairly good report. In my view as deputy chairman of the committee, it lacks detail and bite in a couple of areas but as a first attempt it is a good one. I suggest that it needs a follow-up in a year or two to see whether agencies have taken note of these recommendations, whether they realise that the parliament is serious about the protection of confidential information and whether they have adopted procedures where there are blatant discrepancies and blatant failures to safeguard confidentiality.

          , indicating that Australian tax officials are browsing individual files. To me it is a matter of deepest concern that an individual, without supervision or approval from a superior officer, can go and browse the taxation returns of any constituents. That article, entitled `Flash! And the tax office lights up', by Mike Taylor, is a report of a hearing concerning the ATO, where an officer had extended his browsing rights to gathering information from a private employer for whom he worked for a short period of time. He then returned to the tax office and used the information that he had gained while in private employment to organise audits and raids on his former employer in the private sector.

          He was pretty severely dealt with by the tax office, but in the process of the hearing it was disclosed that it is considered by the tax office that it is not inappropriate that audit officers browse files and try to pick up information about the behaviour of certain individuals that might lead them on a trail to make fines following an audit. This is a wrong process and I think it discloses an ethos and a practice that the committee felt was there but was never disclosed by the tax office.

          Part of this process is driven by an incentive payment to the officer if he instigates a successful audit. It is money in his pocket if he screws somebody for every bit of tax that he can get out of him. So we have here a grossly improper process. A person using the authority of the Crown for personal gain on a particular issue can go to any individual and draw up a list of misdemeanours, relying on confidential information. The power of the Crown can be held over that individual in the hope of gaining some sort of conviction or, from my knowledge of the community, a willingness to admit that there may have been a breach and then a willingness to settle quickly to stop any further disruption to a business or to a place of work. That is grossly improper and it was never disclosed by the tax office. In the strongest terms I condemn the tax office for neither making disclosures nor saying that it encouraged a turn-back process to allow audit officers to browse files.

          That matches other information that came to us from an ICAC inquiry in New South Wales into the affairs of state government officials. It indicated that there are officials selling confidential information to private organisations—banks, credit agencies and all sorts of groups. Mr Justice Roden, in that inquiry, said that he believed—and it is on our record—that the Commonwealth officials are just as much in breach as he found state officials to be. He believed that an ICAC type inquiry into Commonwealth administration would disclose, in areas such as Telecom, social security and health, a commercial value for information held in trust by the Commonwealth. I pursued that line of argument with him and he was strongly of the opinion that the Commonwealth needed to clean up its act. I refer the Committee to appendix E, which is a study of a number of cases of Commonwealth breaches identified by Mr Justice Roden even though it was not his purpose to investigate those breaches.

          In data matching, where information is gained from the Australian Tax Office in the tax file number process, there is a privacy process in place, and I must say that all government departments tend to observe the processes very well. But where there is not a tax file number the process is outside the scope of the Privacy Act, and we had evidence of as many as 100 million data matches out in the community which are known only to departments, unknown by the individuals involved, and they are completely unauthorised and unsupervised. We do not know whether they are destroyed at the end of the period of the data match, no records are kept and there is no process of accountability. This matter must be brought within the ambit of the Privacy Act as we believe that semi-government agencies must also be gathered within a confidentiality code that protects the privacy of Australian individuals. Indeed, the committee goes so far as to recommend that there should be a privacy code of confidentiality across the nation that the private and public sector need to adhere to.

          I became a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs after the reference on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth had been given to the committee. As indicated by the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, the reference was received from the former Attorney-General, the member for Holt (Mr Duffy), who is now one of the members of the committee. The reference is particularly interesting to me. Anyone who has ever gone into a renovator's dream property and scratched away at the wall and exposed more unforeseen repairs will understand the nature of the problem that we are facing here. This issue is an incredibly complex one with which to grapple, particularly for those of us who are barely literate in terms of information technology.

          In the good old days, we had bits of paper on file, people put their signatures on the bits of paper and the files were stuffed in drawers. In the good old days it was easy to control—perhaps. However, the complexity of information technology today and the way in which it hangs together in government departments, across the nation and at an international level means that it is very hard to understand, let alone to keep up with the pace of change. This is particularly so for people who are my age, but I will not speak for my children.

          This report is the tip of the iceberg, and, although the committee recognises this fact, the committee was very keen to ensure that it produced a report which gave some direction. With this issue, as with many others around information technology and information policy in Australia, we are in the situation of beginning to understand what we have yet to deal with. As a result of other aspects which were identified in the course of preparing this report, I expect that this committee will be given more references of a similar nature in the relatively near future. In addition, other committees, other departments and the community will need to deal with the issues around information policy in Australia.

          There are a number of points of view and points of concern from which to look at this issue, and there are, perhaps, points of opportunity. Australia is the second most involved country in information technology next to the United States. Our per capita use of information technology, particularly computer technology, is second only to the United States. This situation gives us a number of things to consider, such as how to use the situation to our best advantage by playing with these things and by putting them all together. The situation also provides us with opportunities to make use of our natural advantage.

          The OECD has recognised this requirement in a number of ways. Justice Michael Kirby chaired the OECD committee which looked at developing security guidelines for the protection of information. If Australia wants to be the leading light in the Asia-Pacific region in this area, our progress gives us that opportunity. Given that Australia can develop the legal, technological and cultural framework to deal with the power of information technology and the ability to protect information, we have a magnificent opportunity to place ourselves at a particular point in the world in the international trade area that will be of benefit to us.

          The bottom line is that if a big company is spread around the world, and its information is circling the globe at increasing volume and increasing speed, it wants to know that its information is safe from predators of whatever kind. If we have the legal, technological and cultural framework here in Australia, we do not become the weakest link, and the weakest link of information is the biggest risk to any company because information really is dollars. That is part of the problem we have seen throughout this process. We might not like to think it is nice, but what often happens out there is that there is trade in information. That happens in the private sector, in the commercial world and, unfortunately, I believe it also happens in the world of government—state and federal.

          this morning, as the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) pointed out, of people doing it for their own particular advantage or the problem of someone who is going to trade that on for advantage to somebody else, these issues really have to be confronted—and confronted very seriously.

          One emphasis that seemed to come through most of the submissions was that it was a cultural matter. It is not just cultural. It has to be more than the sort of passive reaction that says, `Oh, yes, we will talk about it and try to make people more aware of it.' It has to be a far more aware response than that. As we have recommended in this report, it needs a very direct, active response by senior managers to accept responsibility. It should not be just something done around a cup of tea, like a workshop or a seminar, but active responsibility for protection of information. That responsibility must also be sheeted home at a very high level. In fact, the secretary to the department must be the person ultimately very much on the front line in this regard.

          I think culture is important. The legal framework and people's responsibilities, particularly in relation to the Privacy Act, are important. But it is also important from the point of view of technology. One of the things we face is that technology in this area is changing dramatically and it is therefore very important that the Privacy Act is kept in touch with the changes in technology. We have spoken about data matching.

They are quite useful in the way in which programs can be put together to save money, to identify problems, and so forth. Many of the concerns of the Privacy Commissioner quite legitimately relate to the problems around data matching and the problems that technology will allow an interference in the rights of privacy. The Privacy Act needs to be flexible or modified sufficiently quickly to keep up with the technology so that governments and individuals are enhanced by the Privacy Act all the way through.

          One of the things the committee has recommended, which is very important in terms of sanctions and the Crimes Act, is the way in which all aspects, all points of that interchange of information, become subject to sanction. In the past, that has not necessarily been the case. There is quite a degree of disparity in the way in which issues of information crime are dealt with between various acts of sanction. What we are suggesting is a far more concrete way, a far more deliberate and comprehensive way to deal with this matter. It is something which I am sure will go a long way to producing not only a better culture but also a better legal framework.

I would expect that there would be a number of other approaches through other committees about how these things are impacting upon our society, upon the way we conduct government and, indeed, business. The recommendation of a national privacy code, as the member for Mitchell has already indicated, is a very important concept to be grasped. We have found that, as many organisations are privatised or corporatised, one way or another they move outside the direct ambit of the Privacy Act, and then a lot of information also moves with them. Whether or not it concerns issues that we have discussed, such as Telecom or many others, there is a need for Australian citizens, for the good conduct of business and government, to ensure that that privacy code extends right across the national framework.

We have opportunities here to make ourselves a centre of information and information policy that we can draw on. Once we start drawing on policy and legal frameworks, we start to develop technological and industrial edges as well. This is where the future is; we are all part it.

          The reason I wanted to speak was to highlight two particular problems I see. The first is that, while I endorse everything that is in the committee report, there is a real problem in the conflict between the public's right to know and the privacy of the individual. I do not know, even in these recommendations, whether we have actually given enough emphasis to that apparent conflict. The line drawn between the absolute necessity, for public purposes, for there to be availability of information and the right of individuals to protect their own information as something sacrosanct is a fine line; and I accept that. But it worries me. It is not that anyone would suggest that, under every public service log or under every area of information, there is necessarily information to which everybody has a right to gain access. I want to talk in a minute about a few abuses of that which worry me.

          There is certainly a real problem: if you prevent information being disclosed, then it is going to be very difficult for the public servant in many instances to undertake his responsibility. It is also difficult for the public at large, if they are denied access to some of that information, to understand the processes of government; and, for ministers and for government itself, it becomes extraordinarily hard to formulate public policy. We have made a number of recommendations which are all trended towards the development of the privacy code to which the honourable member for Mitchell referred, and towards the prevention of undue disclosure.

          That is all an absolute necessity, but I am worried that there may be too much emphasis on the protection of the information as distinct from the real requirement to ensure that information is available for the purposes for which it is required. Of course, in stating the reasons that information is to be channelled between departments and the way in which there are to be controls, we have tried to ensure that there are not too many restraints; but it is a side of the privacy debate that needs to be identified. In the presentation of this report, it would be wrong if that were not given some emphasis.

          Having said that, and having agreed with my colleagues, I feel that there are two other important things to mention. Essentially, the days of the Internet have changed the availability of information and the access to it, in a way that really does promote enormous challenges. One of the examples where that is apparent is in a number of instances in recent revolutions, where it has been possible for information to be exchanged over the Internet about what is happening long before anyone else knows. In closed societies, such as those of China and the former Soviet Union, it has been particularly important, because the information has come out through the Internet before it has come out in any other form of communication, and that ensures that, in closed societies, there is some chance of knowing what goes on. The Internet has enormous implications in all sorts of ways, quite apart from those on which Kerry Packer is currently trying to capitalise. It is important that it be used in a way which does not unduly discourage individuals by making them feel that, whatever they say or do, everything they own and all their personal affairs are suddenly going to be available at large. Of course, that is the reason for our recommendation of a privacy code.

          One aspect of the availability of information that numbers of us have referred to over time has been the frequency with which, in recent times, individuals—particularly in Nigeria, but in Africa generally—have been writing to individuals to solicit funds or to suggest that there are huge sums of money available in some way for people to be given access to. A number of my own constituents have received such letters in the past fortnight. I have received one myself, in my private capacity. It appals me that out there, regrettably, there are likely to be people gullible enough to respond.

If they do not know who their federal member is, they should write to the federal Attorney-General, enclosing that letter. Under no circumstances should they try to make contact with the person whose name is on that letter.

          There are several letters—there is not only one individual involved—and all of them are highly suspect. As I say, they are part of the invasion of privacy which the sale of confidential lists of names in fact represents. Unfortunately, the problem exists commercially as much as it does in the public sector, and these names may well have even come from the Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Commission or electoral rolls. They could have come from anywhere. This is a very good example of behaviour which this particular report attempts to redress. I am concerned that the nature of the lure being offered is such that I have little doubt that people will be tempted to respond. I say to any of them that, if they have any doubts at all, and if they do not know the person writing the letter, they should not respond. They should take the letter to somebody else and get advice before they react to it in any way.

          I know of at least 20 instances in my own electorate in the last few weeks where such letters have been made available. They are all totally false. The funds to which the letters refer are non-existent, and the economies of the countries from which the letters emanate are in such a state that if they were true, it would be the people of those countries who would be prejudiced if any such transaction did result. Having said that, I commend the report; but I think there does need to be a balance between the public right to know and the essential privacy of the individual. In the report we have attempted to identify that balance. I believe it has been reasonably effectively secured, and for that reason I support the recommendations in the report.

          —I am pleased to join with other members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in supporting the 39 recommendations which the committee has handed down. This report on the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth is another indication of how effectively many of the committees of the House of Representatives are working. I had a previous term in this place from 1984 to 1987, and I have noticed a tremendous change in the ensuing years. There is a very real sense of cooperation in those committees. On many occasions we might not agree, but the result is that the reports which are handed down are thought provoking. As they are worked out, wherever possible we are able to come to common principles.

          The report we are discussing today has had a fairly long and tortuous history. It has been to two parliaments and it has been subjected to two Attorneys-General. Because of the recent trend to refer bills to the committee for consideration, perhaps it has not been possible to give this report the attention that this committee would otherwise have chosen to give to it. During the period over which this reference has been considered, four substantial reports on bills have been prepared in 10 months. I believe that both the government and the opposition have been very pleased with the way that the committee has been able to consider bills and bring forward recommendations, many of which have been considered and have been adopted by the parliament.

          That is the upside. The downside is that the report we are discussing today has been delayed. It was initially brought before the committee by the former Attorney-General, now a member of the committee, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). Terms of reference were advertised, and numbers of meetings and public hearings took place. Following the election in 1993 and the appointment of the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to that position, the terms of reference which have resulted in this report were seen as being of continuing significance, to the extent that the Attorney again referred the terms of reference to the committee on 28 May 1993. Further submissions were called for, and 109 submissions and 40 exhibits were received from a wide range of groups in society.

          Significantly, in the course of its deliberations the committee considered the possibility of the amalgamation of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. There are views one way and the other. Initially I was sympathetic to bringing both of these acts under the same umbrella, but on reflection it was a decision of the committee that the two acts should continue to be separate acts. After all, they deal with different aspects of citizens' rights. The Freedom of Information Act concentrates on the right of the citizen to have access to information in the public arena, and the Privacy Act emphasises our individual rights to privacy.

          As has been indicated by prior speakers, what we need to do is to create a culture in the public services of Australia and in government agencies and, I believe, in the commercial organisations also, where the privacy of the individual is respected. It takes a while for such a culture to build up. It simply cannot be legislated for and it does not happen overnight. However, from the submissions we received and from the attitudes we were able to perceive from groups contacting us, I think that we are well along the way to an improvement in this culture of privacy.

          As society develops and becomes more complex and as technology gallops along, there are additional complications. The honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), in his contribution, drew our attention to a number of those matters. Most importantly, the committee has directed its attention to the need for computer security. As we have more people working at home—I do not know whether they would be called outworkers—on private computers, a lot of the information which would normally be stored in a central area goes home with the person. Clearly, what we need to do is to make sure that that information is subjected to the same rules, regulations and protections as information generally.

          Also, it is very important to realise that, as the government and all governments accept, the federal bureaucracy does not always have the best and most efficient means of handling matters and, as a result of this, we have more contracting out. The law must therefore be applied to the agencies contracting with government in order to make them responsible for privacy principles in the same way as the government bureaucracy itself. It would be terrible if, in the pursuit of financial efficiency and efficiency in government generally, we referred matters out to private organisations and, when those referrals were made, the citizen was no longer protected in the same way as a citizen would have been had matters continued to be handled by the government. It is very important that the committee has covered this in its recommendations.

          Another thing that we really have to look at is that, although there has been a growing appreciation in government of the need to preserve a citizen's privacy, because it has not been a high priority the junior pen-pusher—the junior office boy, or office person, to be politically correct—quite often has been responsible for privacy. The result is that there have been some fairly appalling lapses of privacy. The committee heard very disturbing examples where, in some cases, Commonwealth public servants have even sold information. That is very worrying. One of the recommendations very much necessary to treat privacy with the importance that we want it treated is to ensure that senior managers in government agencies and government bodies are indeed responsible for privacy.

          When one looks at the many and varied laws throughout Australia, one finds that different items of legislation provide for different levels of privacy in different circumstances. That is why I support very strongly the proposal of the committee that there be the development of a privacy code, so that we can have a consistency of standard. I certainly hope that the government takes this up when there are consultations between the Commonwealth government, on the one hand, and the various state and territory governments on the other. This really is very important. As the honourable member for Jagajaga pointed out, the government in this country needs to help create the legal, cultural and technological framework to make sure that we have the right approach to privacy in Australia.

          The right honourable member for New England also highlighted another matter which I was going to mention—the Internet. Almost on a daily basis, when we open the newspapers we find how this new technology is galloping along. I am told that there could be up to a billion people on the Internet by the year 2000 and currently in Australia we have 500,000 people who apparently are linked to the Internet. One really must look very seriously at the Internet to see how it is possible to protect the privacy of individuals because the technology is different. It could be that our report may have been overtaken by technology and that a future committee must look at this again. It is one of those very important items of activity which must be consistently reviewed on a regular basis.

Some of us would have liked the report to have been a little more extensive in some areas, but it is vital for the government to recognise that this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a unanimous report. It represents the collective wisdom of both sides of parliament. We sat down over a period of three years and sought to bring forward recommendations to the government. We have had many submissions and two sets of public hearings. We sat during two parliaments and the result is, in the dying stages of this parliament, we are fortunate to be able to present this report.

In fact, the lead time to a response to some of these reports has been so long that the report has been entirely out of date and committees have had to go back to the drawing board yet again.

I understand only three members of the current committee were members of the previous committee and there has been a lot of duplication.

The second inquiry, which concluded on 28 May 1991, was again based on hearsay and unsigned statements, and was critical of the officer.

It should be pointed out that Mr Woodhouse has had no formal training for investigations of any kind.

He is now enjoying his unearned fruits of a valued position in Washington.

          The inquiry obviously concerned the year 2000 Olympics and the contribution the games can make to Australia's image in the region. More particularly, the inquiry looked at the sports equipment industry, issues such as the marketing of Olympic merchandise, the question of the infrastructure that will develop around the Olympics and, in general, Australia's possible gains from this Olympic win.

          Could I at the outset also raise in a bigger sense the question of employment and its relationship with this inquiry. The main reason I am particularly interested in that aspect is the fact that a predominant part of the Olympics site is in my electorate. It is worth noting that the central west region of Sydney, in the last quarter figures, has an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent, two percentage points above the national average. It is also worth keeping in mind that there was a very strong drop in the unemployment rate in the region in the last year, going down by 4 1/2 per cent, whereas the national trend only went down by 1.6 per cent. To some degree it is catching up but it is still at a higher level.

          It is also worth noting that in the particular municipality where the Olympics are sited, Auburn, the unemployment level is significantly higher than in the other two councils areas that constitute that sub-region. There is a particular problem in regard to unemployment in this region. I took opportunity to write to some companies, trying to register with them the need to employ local labour to partly overcome this problem. There have been some embryonic efforts made by the Auburn Council but it tends to be a council with minimal staffing and really it has not focused enough on the problem. I have to say also that there have been some gestures by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to try to ensure that its local agencies provide a good part of the work force.

          Local geography exerts a major influence over people's access to waged work. Commuting costs have a major impact on the incomes of low-wage workers concentrated in lower-cost housing areas on the metropolitan fringes. Public transport is inadequate in western Sydney especially for cross-hauling between suburbs. Continued suburbanisation of economic activity has made this increasingly common in the 1990s. This discriminates severely against young people and women in one-car families. Using public transport can also become a security fear for people having to cope with the changing working hours, especially for part-time positions in manufacturing and retailing establishments. Information sources about employment opportunities both regionally and in the wider labour market are often relatively poor amongst the people most vulnerable to high unemployment rates. Finally, there is considerable anecdotal evidence, at least, of discrimination by prospective employees in the wider Sydney labour market against employing `westies' given their long journeys to work and social stereotyping.

         As I have said, this Olympic site is in a region that has significant problems. More particularly, the unemployment problem in that region is related to the high proportion of people from a non-English speaking background.

          Turning to the broader inquiry, I think it substantially deals with the major problems. It is worth noting what the report it has to say about the Olympics and what it will be providing. On page 5 of the summary it notes that, for the first time in Olympic history, all athletes will be housed in the Olympic Village at Homebush Bay, that the majority of venues will be within 30 minutes of the Olympic Village, that competition in 14 sports will be held at Homebush Bay, that 15,000 media people are expected to converge on Sydney, and that every night of the games 220,000 additional people are expected to be staying in Sydney. That gives us some dimensions of the issues and the possible ramifications.

          One of the important focuses of the Olympic planning of the previous state government, and it is being followed through by the new state government, is the concern with the environment. This inquiry notes the very good work done in respect of energy conservation and the use of renewable sources, water conservation, waste avoidance and minimisation, protecting human health, and protecting natural and cultural environments in the area. There has been significant remediation of what was once a very contaminated site due to a variety of uses for such things as abattoirs, timber yards, and fairly unsavoury industrial plants, et cetera.

          There has been very significant regeneration of Homebush Bay and, to a large degree, that was the reason that this site was chosen. It is worth noting the comments of Karla Bell from Greenpeace.

         She is focusing there on the possibilities in the environmental fields, and that relates again to Australian manufacturing industries.

         Given our rather poor performance at the Berlin conference on updates on global warming, anything we can do to improve our image is worth while. Specifically on the solar question, as people are aware, Australia did a lot of work on this aspect, and on page 33 the inquiry notes:

          Public transport has been briefly mentioned, and one of the issues that is on the agenda with the New South Wales state government is the question of whether there will be an in-out railway line or loop. This is a very important ingredient of the environmental issues of the games. Certainly, a loop in and out of the site would provide a lot quicker system, thus ensuring that the number of people using cars will be minimised. For the difference in the amount of money there is between the up-front costs of a simple one-track loop and the long-term costs, there can be no argument whatsoever but that we should go for that system which maximises public transport use and minimises car use within the games.

          The other suggestions of the inquiry cover a variety of issues that are really out there in the marketplace and are central to the games and their place in Australian industry. The committee has suggested that there be additional funding for an Olympics tourism marketing campaign. I do not think we need to elaborate upon the vital nature of tourism to Australia's gross domestic product. It is such that, this week in parliament, it is leading policy debate in large part in areas such as visa policy and the export market development grant changes. Once again, this committee is saying that tourism is a central requirement of the country and that there should be additional funding for it.

Perhaps the committee could have been a bit more radical and could have pushed on the question of pressurising industry to actually do it.

          Once again, this is an opportunity to promote Australian sporting expertise. As the economies of our region improve and the middle class grows in these countries, there is more demand and more concern for fitness and more access to sporting time, leisure, et cetera. These games provide Australia with an opportunity to market itself in those crucial fields and, of course, in the very closely related area of sporting equipment. The report essentially says that Australian industry should seek to maximise its opportunities, and it certainly covers the issue of the environmental standards that have been a major hallmark of this submission and the resulting successful application.

        I am unable to provide the information requested. Records of goods imported are maintained under the items in the Australian Customs Tariff. The tariff item for specific goods is generally determined by their nature rather than by the material of which they are composed. There are no specific tariff items for goods of hemp-based non-narcotic materials. I understand that goods such as fabrics, apparel, rope, paper, building materials and cosmetics often contain such materials, however, it is not possible, given the tariff structure, to determine the specific values of these goods.
