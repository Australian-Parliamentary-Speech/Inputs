        The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1965, and to repeal the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. The bill will also introduce minor technical amendments to the following portfolio acts to correct formal errors, omit a redundancy and fix misdescribed amendments: Dried Vine Fruits Equalisation Act 1978; Forestry and Timber Bureau Act 1930; Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989; and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991.

        The proposed amendment to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will prevent recipients of the drought relief payment (DRP) or their partners `double dipping' by receiving support in a couple&amp;hyphen;rate payment under this act while at the same time obtaining payments or allowances identified separately under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. When DRP is calculated, an amount for the partner is included in the DRP payment. Hence, if the partner were to claim such a partner or parenting allowance in his or her own right, he or she would in effect receive the same support twice—once as a component of the DRP and again as a separate payment under the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Following this amendment such a case would not be possible.

        The repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 is designed to facilitate the adjustment of the Australian tobacco industry towards international competitiveness. In July 1995, the activities of the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee (ATMAC) were wound up in anticipation of the repeal of the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965 under which ATMAC operated. ATMAC was established primarily to recommend to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy the annual price and quantity for Australian tobacco leaf purchased by Australian cigarette manufacturers.

        This bill is a central plank of the package of bills to replace the Audit Act 1901. The other main bills in the package are the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996. Completing the package is the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous)

         Amendment Bill 1996, which will amend the multitude of other Commonwealth acts that connect with the Audit Act in a variety of ways. It provides the necessary formal machinery for the Commonwealth to make an orderly transition from its current, ageing and inadequate financial framework.

        The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1996 is designed to achieve a number of related purposes: foremost, the re&amp;hyphen;establishment of the Office of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General of the Commonwealth of Australia, but in a way that both symbolically and practically strengthens the functional independence of the office beyond that available under current laws. The bill declares the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to be an `independent officer of the parliament', as an expression of the primary and unique relationship which the office has with the parliament. In keeping with the government's publicly stated commitment to confer genuine functional independence on the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General, a range of statutory safeguards are included in the bill to prevent inappropriate influence being exerted on the Auditor-General by either the executive or the parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill's other main purposes are to specify, clarify and broaden the powers and functions of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General as the external auditor of all Commonwealth bodies; to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory agency; and to provide, in turn, for the independent audit of the Australian National Audit Office. Many of the provisions in this bill reflect the significant and valuable work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in pressing for a strengthening of the role of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

        I now wish to provide an outline of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill. In establishing the Office of Auditor&amp;hyphen;General for the Commonwealth of Australia, the bill details the processes of appointment and conditions of the office. As a statutory office&amp;hyphen;holder, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General will continue to be appointed by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General on the recommendation of the appropriate minister—whom the administrative arrangements orders are expected to continue to specify as the Prime Minister. Under arrangements proposed in this bill, prior to advising the Governor&amp;hyphen;General of the proposed appointee, that minister must seek the JCPA's endorsement to the proposal. That is, the parliament—through the JCPA—is to have the right of veto over the government's choice of Auditor&amp;hyphen;General. The bill also retains the current safeguards for the removal of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General following a petition by both houses of the parliament in the same session.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="8343" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is to have a broad mandate enshrined in legislation, replacing the existing arrangements whereby the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's mandate is only partly derived from legislation and partly from government policy. The Auditor-General will have a mandate to audit the financial statements of, and conduct performance audits on, all Commonwealth bodies. For bodies that are government business enterprises, in recognition of the fact that they are subject to the overlaying accountability framework that requires them to pursue optimal market performance and to improve the return to the Commonwealth as shareholder, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General would not subject them to performance audits unless requested by parliament—through the JCPA—or a minister. If the body concerned is a partially privatised Commonwealth company, however, it would not be subjected to a performance audit. In this regard, the government has reflected on the need to continue the princi ple, as already accepted under the Audit Act 1901, of forbearance in consideration of the investment interests of private shareholders in such companies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Performance audits are an extra feature on the accountability landscape peculiar to public sector bodies. It does not follow, however, that the often high parliamentary profile given the reports of such audits would always be beneficial to the interests of the companies' private investor/shareholders. To avoid the claim that, through imposing this extra tier of performance auditing, the Commonwealth was, thus, `oppressing' the minority private shareholders, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's surveillance over the operations of partially privatised Commonwealth companies is to be exclusively as the mandated external auditor of their financial statements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill seeks to permit the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to enter into an arrangement with any person or body to conduct financial statements audits or performance audits for them, or to provide them with services of a kind that are normally performed by auditors. These arrangements would be at the discretion of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and be undertaken if it is within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so, and the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General considers there is a benefit to the Commonwealth.

        The bill seeks to establish the Australian National Audit Office as a statutory authority with exclusive functional responsibility to the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.

        The staff of the Australian National Audit Office are to be appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922, as a reflection of the fact that auditing the operations of the executive is a core service to the public through the parliament. Should the staff's existing skills and expertise need to be augmented from time to time, the bill also seeks to preserve the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's flexibility to engage any person—for example, to contract with auditors or other specialists from

        The bill proposes that the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and authorised officials have full and free access to information and documents in the performance of mandated functions. These powers are considerable in their scope but are necessary if the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General is to fulfil his or her obligations to the parliament. The information gathering powers are complemented with strong secrecy and penalty provisions for any person performing an Auditor&amp;hyphen;General function.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also seeks to re&amp;hyphen;establish the Office of Independent Auditor who is the parliament's auditor of the Australian National Audit Office. It provides for the appointment and conditions of the office which, as far as are appropriate, mirror those of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General in relation to his or her audit functions for the balance of the Commonwealth. The Independent Auditor is to be a part&amp;hyphen;time statutory officer appointed by the Governor&amp;hyphen;General on the advice of the appropriate minister—again, this is expected to be the Prime Minister—with the JCPA having the same right of veto over the government's choice of nominee as it does in the selection of Auditor&amp;hyphen;General.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have already indicated, the government has drawn heavily on the recommendations of the JCPA in framing this legislation. While the committee's recommendations have not been taken up in their entirety, the provisions of this bill and the complementary provisions in the other bills in the package provide the statutory environment in which the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General—with all the professional and functional freedom required for the task—can fulfil, fearlessly and independently, the role demanded by parliament on behalf of the Australian people.

        This bill, together with the other two main bills that are part of this package—namely, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Bill 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996—will replace the Audit Act 1901.

        Before dealing with some of the details included in this bill, it is important to point out the boundaries of coverage over the Commonwealth's financial affairs that will be established by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act. In relation to financial administration, every Commonwealth body falls into one of two categories, according to the basic legal financial status that each body has. It either has the legal capacity, in its own right, by virtue of its incorporating legislation, to acquire ownership of money or other assets coming into its possession; or the body will function only as a financial and custodial agent for the legal entity that is the Commonwealth, without acquiring separate legal ownership of the money and assets it deals with on the Commonwealth's behalf.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to apply to the operations of bodies that fall into the first category; that is, financially autonomous incorporated Commonwealth bodies that can acquire legal ownership of money in their own right. The proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is to apply to the second category of bodies that, financially, are agents of the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         This bill is concerned, therefore, with establishing the regulatory/accounting/accountability framework for dealing with and managing the money and property of the Commonwealth. It specifies responsibilities and powers necessary for the efficient, effec tive and ethical use of the resources lawfully available to the Commonwealth to carry out its programs; and it provides for appropriate mechanisms to ensure that the stewardship and management performance of those who are responsible for those resources can be made visible and, thereby, allow them to be held accountable.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proposed law will provide a legislative framework for effective and accountable financial management that is not only matched to the public sector environment of today, but a framework that will also be flexible enough to meet the evolutionary changes to Commonwealth financial management practices that the future will inevitably bring. At the same time, the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is intended to preserve, clarify and strengthen the traditional strengths of the Audit Act's key principles of financial control.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill deals comprehensively with its features. There are, however, a few elements that I would like to mention specifically. The definitions of `Agency', `Chief Executive', `official', `public money' and `public property' between them describe the proposed boundaries of the act's application. Within those boundaries, the principles set down in the act will be fleshed out, where necessary, by subsidiary legislation—regulations and Finance Minister's Orders—to provide procedural substance for the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day application of those principles. Such a legislative framework is patterned on the structure established by the Audit Act 1901 for regulations and finance directions, except that, unlike finance directions which are administrative in character, provision is made for Finance Minister's Orders to be tabled as disallowable instruments. The legislative framework will be completed by instructions which chief executives will be authorised to issue to officials of their agencies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act will preserve the role of the Minister for Finance as central to the orderly functioning of the Commonwealth's financial administration. The finance minister is, for all practical purposes, the custodian of the constitutional `Treasury of the Commonwealth', so
        <break page="8345" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that the range of statutory powers and responsibilities for the proper custody of the Commonwealth's money is vested in that office. The finance minister will retain the sole power to agree appropriate banking arrangements for public money, to make orders concerning the handling of receipts and withdrawals of public money, and as to its investment.
        </break>
       </para>

        The existing power under the Audit Act 1901 to arrange overdrafts and advances from banks has been clarified to specifically limit such arrangements as short&amp;hyphen;term cash management tools—overdrafts on operational bank accounts for up to 30 days; borrowings from banks as advances paid to the Commonwealth for up to 90 days; and other types of credit arrangements, to be prescribed by the regulations, such as those represented by credit card and cabcharge transactions, for up to 60 days. It should be noted that these arrangements confer no power for the Commonwealth to spend otherwise than as authorised by parliament through appropriations.

        One of the most visible changes to be brought about by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Act is in relation to the accounting classifications of money in the Commonwealth's possession. The trust fund established by section 60 of the Audit Act 1901 is to be abolished and replaced by two purpose based funds—the reserved money fund and the commercial activities fund. Apart from components of the reserved money fund that may be established pursuant to other enactments, the components of these two funds will be established or varied by finance minister's determinations. The effect of such determinations will be to specify the kinds of money that may be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund or loan fund and credited to the particular component and the purposes on which that money may then be spent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Since the spending of money from such a fund is, in all respects, an appropriation, the proposed act will require that these determinations by the finance minister be tabled as disallowable instruments that do not take effect until the period for disallowance has
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         passed. This procedure is more visible and provides a greater measure of parliamentary control than has traditionally been the case in the establishment of trust accounts under the Audit Act 1901.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Payments of public money, including debiting a fund against an appropriation, will be controlled by a system of `drawing rights', to be issued by the finance minister. This system is predicated on the fact that the laws made by parliament relating to appropriations, variously compelling or permitting the executive government to spend, always specify the fund being appropriated and the purpose of the spending. Such laws may also specify an amount and a time frame.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would be a breach of section 83 of the constitution for spending to occur in any instance outside of those parameters, so the act will stipulate that the finance minister has no capacity to issue valid drawing rights that are inconsistent with the terms of the relevant appropriation law; and makes it an indictable offence for an official or minister to knowingly spend, or seek to spend, otherwise than in accordance with a valid drawing right.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act would put into the principal legislation the powers that are presently carried only in finance regulations in relation to providing a source of authority for the Presiding Officers to approve expenditure under appropriations for parliamentary departments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The present Audit Act 1901 is generally silent on matters of management performance. The new act seeks to remedy this through particular responsibilities being expressly placed on chief executives of agencies for which they may then be held accountable. They are to be required to manage the affairs of their agencies efficiently, effectively and ethically to the extent allowed by law. They will also be required to implement fraud control plans and establish audit committees. The accountability mechanisms to mesh with these responsibilities will include powers of the finance minister to obtain financial statements and other reports more frequently than annually from agencies.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Importantly, it is proposed that chief executives be permitted to subdelegate to officials any of the act's finance minister's powers or
        <break page="8346" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         functions, unless the minister has imposed a restriction prohibiting or limiting such subdelegation. These arrangements for subdelegating are intended to achieve a major strengthening in the financial framework. Chief executives are better placed than the finance minister to manage, to monitor and to control the activities of those officials who perform the delegated tasks.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will thus be practicable to hold chief executives accountable to the finance minister in these respects, whereas it is currently quite impracticable to do so under the existing Audit Act's delegation structures where thousands of individual officials are directly delegated by the finance minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This proposed law will be a lever for much&amp;hyphen;needed change to sharpen and strengthen the framework of Commonwealth financial administration. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House.

        The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1996 is one of the main bills in the package of legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. The initial trigger for this bill is the necessity to replace part XI of the Audit Act which currently provides standard financial, reporting and auditing provisions for Commonwealth authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, only about two&amp;hyphen;thirds of Commonwealth authorities rely on part XI of the Audit Act. The rest, instead, have their own financial, reporting and auditing provisions. Similarly, the memoranda and articles of association of wholly&amp;hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies contain their own requirements in
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         so far as accountability to ministers is concerned. Consequently, at present, we have a myriad of variations on a similar theme scattered throughout the statute book and the constitutions of Commonwealth companies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The underlying purpose of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act is to replace all of these diverse accountability requirements with a single set of core requirements. The approach proposed will enable the accountability requirements of Commonwealth controlled bodies to be viewed as a whole and should significantly streamline the focus of the government's and the parliament's interest in this area. Many of the bill's requirements relating to Commonwealth authorities are modelled on comparable areas of the Corporations Law as well as best practice currently applying to individual authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another important feature of the bill is that it extends the mandate of the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth authorities and companies, and their subsidiaries. At the same time it will modernise the requirements for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General's reports on the financial statements of authorities and make them consistent with those required by the Corporations Law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will have become apparent from what I have already said that, in some areas, the bill traverses ground that is covered, to varying degrees, in the establishing legislation of authorities and the constitutional documents of companies. These areas of overlap will be removed by consequential amendments to the establishing legislation and are contained in the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 1996 which is part of this package of bills. Similarly, it is intended that areas of overlap in the memoranda and articles of association of Commonwealth companies be replaced with cross&amp;hyphen;references to the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the purposes of the bill, a `Commonwealth authority' is, in essence, one established by an act as a body corporate for a public purpose and which holds money on its own account. A `Commonwealth company' is one in which the Commonwealth has a direct
        <break page="8347" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         controlling interest—that is, there is no interposed entity between the company and the Commonwealth.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All Commonwealth companies will be subject to the requirement for the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General to report on their financial statements, and the financial statements of their subsidiaries, and for their annual reports to be tabled in the parliament. However, only `wholly&amp;hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies' are to be subject to the other provisions in the bill relating to companies—those other provisions are essentially concerned with the furnishing of information to ministers and keeping them informed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This distinction between `wholly&amp;hyphen;owned' and other Commonwealth companies reflects the difficulty—in the case of Commonwealth controlled companies which have private shareholders—of imposing a general regime which requires the provision of plans and reports only to ministers: namely, a risk of oppression actions by minority shareholders who might perceive discrimination against their interests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will now briefly outline the main provisions of the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The annual report is seen as the centrepiece of directors' accountability to the parliament. The bill proposes that directors of Commonwealth authorities must prepare an annual report containing a report of operations, financial statements and a report by the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General on the financial statements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report of operations and the financial statements must be prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders; the directors and the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General must certify whether, in their opinion, the financial statements give a `true and fair view' of the matters required to be reported. I should mention that the Finance Minister's Orders will be disallowable instruments, thereby ensuring an ongoing role for the parliament in determining the reporting obligations of directors of Commonwealth authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The directors of both Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies will be required to give the responsible minister a copy of their annual report which
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the minister must, in turn, table in each house of the parliament. There are a number of other reporting obligations proposed by this bill which I will briefly mention. The finance minister may require Commonwealth authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned companies to prepare half&amp;hyphen;yearly or quarterly reports. The reports must be given to the responsible minister within two months after the end of the period to which they relate and must be tabled in each house as soon as practicable. It is envisaged that this requirement to prepare interim reports will mainly be applied to bodies with a high degree of independence, such as government business enterprises. A body will formally acquire the status of a GBE by regulations made under the proposed act.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Directors will be required to keep the responsible minister informed of the operations of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies, including their subsidiaries, and to give the responsible minister and the finance minister such documents and information as they may require.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Where the finance minister requires such reports, documents and information, it is intended that, in the normal course, he or she will first consult with the responsible minister and provide a copy of such reports or documents to that minister.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies must also notify the responsible minister of certain proposed activities such as significant acquisitions or disposals of shares or businesses, changes in business activities or involvement in partnerships, trusts or joint ventures. However, the responsible minister may give written guidelines as to the coverage of the matters to be notified and may, in writing, exempt the directors from notifying particulars of proposals to form or participate in the formation of a company.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Directors of a government business enterprise, whether constituted as an authority or a wholly&amp;hyphen;owned company, must prepare a corporate plan at least once a year and give it to the responsible minister. This is a key planning document that will provide the

         responsible minister with financial and other performance information.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to the governance of Commonwealth authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned Commonwealth companies. The bill proposes that the responsible minister may, after consulting with directors, notify them of general policies of the government that are capable of being applied to the authority or wholly&amp;hyphen;owned company concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The directors must ensure that such policies are carried out and, as far as practicable, ensure that they are also carried out in relation to any subsidiaries. Such policies cannot be in conflict with any statutory obligations of a particular authority or company. I should emphasise that this provision does not confer on responsible ministers, or the government, a general power of direction as to how authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned companies are to carry out their particular functions. It is only intended to cover government policies that are applicable to the Commonwealth public sector in general, such as, for example, policies relating to trade contact with particular foreign countries or for the observance of equal employment opportunity policies, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also provides that directors must establish and maintain an audit committee. The government views this as a step in improving internal control and communication within Commonwealth authorities and wholly&amp;hyphen;owned companies as well as sharpening the accountability of their management. It will also ensure that directors have appropriate assistance in the discharge of their accounting and financial reporting obligations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         I will now mention briefly some of the provisions of the bill which only apply to Commonwealth authorities. Consistent with a recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its 1989 report entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Government companies and their reporting requirements
         </emphasis>
         , the bill provides that a Commonwealth authority must ensure that none of its subsidiaries does anything that the authority itself does not have power to do. This does not, of course, preclude the parliament from passing legisla tion to empower a subsidiary to perform a particular activity that exceeds the powers of its parent.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is committed to maintaining the proposed Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act in ways that, as far as practicable, will keep it in harmony with comparable provisions of the Corporations Law, as they exist from time to time. The bill therefore imposes standards of conduct on officers of Commonwealth authorities that are the same as standards already imposed on officers of companies by the Corporations Law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill establishes a penalty regime modelled on the Corporations Law. Accordingly, a number of its provisions are identified as `civil penalty provisions', the breach of which may attract civil or criminal sanctions depending on whether the breach is accompanied by a dishonest intent. Contravention of these provisions may lead to the disqualification of directors from appointments to boards of Commonwealth authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The term `officer', as it is used in the provisions of the bill relating to Commonwealth authorities, is given the same meaning as it has in the equivalent provisions of the Corporations Law. Consequently, an `officer' is a director or any other person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of the authority.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also provides that a director of a Commonwealth authority who has an interest in a matter that is being considered, or about to be considered, by the board, must, as soon as possible after he or she becomes aware of the situation, disclose the nature of the interest concerned at a meeting of the board. The director must not participate in deliberations on the matter concerned unless the board or the responsible minister determines otherwise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, in accordance with another recommendation by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report entitled
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Government companies and their reporting requirements
        </emphasis>
        , the bill provides that the responsible minister shall table in each house particulars of any new or varied direct Commonwealth interest in a company.
        <break page="8349" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         The particulars required are to be prescribed by regulation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The proposals put forward in this bill will have no direct impact on government revenues or outlays. However, I am confident that, through the implementation of a more streamlined and consistent operational and accountability framework for Commonwealth authorities and companies, improved performance and value for money will be achieved both for the Commonwealth and Australians generally. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the House.

        This bill proposes the repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and deals with the transitional and consequential matters arising from the repeal of that act and the enactment of proposed replacement legislation, namely, the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Act 1996, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1996.

        The Audit Act 1901 is a pervading, operational act that gives flesh to certain basic constitutional requirements for the raising and spending of money by the Commonwealth; and, to that end, provides a procedural framework for day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day financial administration and audit across the whole spectrum of Commonwealth activities. Its repeal and replacement, therefore, has an extensive impact. This bill is intended to permit an orderly transition to the new framework.

The committee's enabling act will be amended to reflect this new, additional role by expanding its listed statutory duties to strengthen, on behalf of the parliament, the relationship with the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and the Australian National Audit Office. The committee's responsibilities are now proposed to include consideration of the operations and resources of the ANAO and to report on matters arising out of those considerations; to examine the draft estimates of the ANAO and to make recommendations to both houses of the parliament and the responsible minister on those estimates; and to determine the audit priorities of the parliament and to advise the Auditor&amp;hyphen;General of those priorities. The Public Accounts Committee Act will also be amended to reflect the committee's role, as provided for in the proposed Auditor&amp;hyphen;General Act, in approving recommendations to the Governor&amp;hyphen;General for appointments to the Office of Auditor&amp;hyphen;General and that of Independent Auditor of the ANAO.

        The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will establish a Small Taxation Claims Tribunal within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, AAT.

Applications for review of a taxation objection decision will have to involve less than the determined amount in order to be heard by the Small Taxation Claims Tribunal.

There are now films that provide what is known as `click-on' access to a range of viewing options. This can make classification difficult as the classifier cannot be sure that all of the viewing options available have been accessed for classification purposes. The amendment will put the onus on the applicant to inform the Classification

        When people go to other parts of the world, they often see very good examples of the constitutional history of a country which allows people to partake themselves—to go into the chambers and to have the access that you do not have in this building, which is a working parliament. For those of us who have served in the old parliament and have fond memories of the place, to see the building open to the public the way it is now is a very good thing.

        The worry I have is that the government now seems to want to change things down there quite considerably. In the last day or so, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) advised us that they are going to start to vandalise the old chamber by bringing up the Speaker's chair from that chamber. The chair is very much in keeping with the ornate style of that chamber and very out of keeping with the style of this chamber.

        It has been suggested that the government is going to spend between $300,000 and $500,000 to move the chair up here. The government was telling people yesterday that those receiving meals on wheels will have to pay $30 a week more. It would seem an absolutely disgraceful waste of public money to spend nearly half a million dollars ripping the chair out of the middle of Old Parliament House and bringing it up here.

        There are also some symbolism problems that I think we should take into account in doing that as well. As members might recall, the old chair is a very ornate piece of work. It has a lot of attributes that would make it look out of place in this chamber. The old chamber was a closed&amp;hyphen;in type of chamber; this is a very open chamber. To have the Speaker sitting up in a chair that has a canopy over it, looking like he or she was in a cubbyhole—which is what it would look like in this building—I think would look aesthetically ridiculous in this chamber.

          an extra $30 a week to get meals on wheels'. Pensioners are going to have to pay about 20 per cent extra of their pension so that they can eat—and the government is willing to waste $500,000 ripping apart the old House of Representatives chamber and ripping apart the old building! A hole will have to be knocked in the wall to get the chair out and the doors of this building will have to be taken off to put the chair in here. Later on the government will probably have to pay for a replica to go down into the old chamber—and that would cost more money.

         —I was just getting on to that. We are talking about the redevelopment of the opposition party room. That was the room where the Government Whip, who is going to speak after me, got up and rammed these silly motions in the old parliament about why we should have the chair moved up here. The member for Warringah's close friend and predecessor was the person who got up in that opposition party room and ran the argument in those days to bring the chair up here.

        So this debate about what we should do with the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives was canvassed quite considerably in that historic opposition party room which has now been refurbished. That is where this silly debate first started. There is a great symmetry in this argument here before us today about the excesses of the former member for Warringah and the excesses of the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur)

        If the government now want to reinsert those ideas of domination into this House let them stand up and say so but let us not do this by stealth. What happened in that opposition party room was that the debate was won and lost down there and it should have stayed down there. It should not be brought up here now, nearly 10 years after we have moved into this building. We most certainly should not have this massive waste of public money—half a million dollars or so to move it up here and then more money for a replica.

        It would be a little bit interesting to know why the government want to bring up only the Speaker's chair; why in that debate they had in the opposition party room was there never any discussion about bringing up the President's chair? I do not know whether the reason for that could be that the President's chair was given to us by the Canadian parliament—and those opposite are not all that interested in the Canadians.

        But the House of Representatives Speaker's chair was given to Australia by a now defunct body. What was that body? When you work out why the English monarch's crest is on it, it makes you twig what the body was: it was the Dominion Parliamentary Association, a body that does not exist any more. The Dominion Parliamentary Association was made up of all those little unfree countries that finally got away from the motherland and became the Commonwealth. That chair has a little sign on it saying it was given to us by the 1,200&amp;hyphen;odd parliamentarians who made up—I am sorry, it was not the Dominion; I was wrong. It was worse! It was the Empire Parliamentary Association and it was not even the poor old Dominion that gave it to us; it was the United Kingdom branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association.

There is a certain symmetry in that of course because that was also a period when John Howard was responsible for the economy.

         That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville.

         This proposal seeks approval for the Townsville army aviation works project. The 5 Aviation Regiment provides air mobility, medium lift and aerial fire support to army units. Its main customer is 3rd Brigade located at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, which provides a ready deployment force for the ADF through air mobile, air portable operations. Under restructuring, the Australian Army's 5 Aviation Regiment will continue to be based at RAAF base Townsville to provide helicopter support to land force units located in northern Australia.

         Since the introduction of the Black Hawk, unexpected corrosion has been identified in the helicopters based at 5 Aviation Regiment. The level of corrosion is such that maintenance costs associated with corrosion are expected to exceed sustainable funding levels. In addition, the capacity to operate the helicopters through to life of type is diminished. To ensure that the Black Hawk can be operated through to life of type, the Department of Defence has instigated a corrosion control program.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To support the corrosion control program, it is proposed to construct a number of additional facilities at 5 Aviation Regiment. These facilities will reduce corrosion caused by operation and storage of the helicopters in the humid, salt laden atmospheric conditions and will include helicopter environmental protection shelters, a helicopter wash facility and dehumidification equipment for Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. Degradation of the helicopters from high temperatures and ultraviolet radiation will also be reduced.

         The existing 5 Aviation Regiment transport compound and some technical workshop facilities are inappropriately located remote from the 5 Aviation Regiment precinct. The facilities are inadequate and their locations present an ongoing cost to unit efficiency.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="8359" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          The works proposed include the construction of a purpose built transport compound and workshop complex for vehicle maintenance and general engineering. Other ancillary works to correct existing deficiencies at 5 Aviation Regiment include the relocation of the small arms repair section and the refur bishment of the gunship helicopter loading point known as ordnance loading area No. 6.

         Subject to parliamentary approval, works are planned to commence in March 1997 with construction to be completed by December 1998. The preliminary estimate for the proposed construction works is $19.1 million at December 1996 prices. The outturn cost is $21.332 million. The Public Works Committee in its report tabled on 11 December concluded in part that the proposed environmental protection shelters, the provision of dehumidification equipment and the helicopter wash facility can be justified as providing the necessary facilities for the successful and economic implementation of the corrosion control plan.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scope of works for the transport compound and workshop facilities can be justified on the basis of considerably improved working conditions and improved shelter and security for the extensive fleet of vehicles, resulting in improved efficiency. The extent of proposed ancillary work will improve the small arms repair section and ordinance loading aprons. The committee recommends the development of facilities for 5 Aviation Regiment at RAAF Base Townsville at an outturn cost of $21.332 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House.

          —I just want to make a few brief remarks about this proposal. I certainly would not oppose it. Members of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade have had the opportunity to visit 5 Aviation Regiment at Townsville. Many members have said in this House that they have been impressed by the way the regiment have gone about their business after this most recent tragedy. But that is not the purpose of my remarks.

         The minister in his statement—and I would be grateful if he might elaborate—said that this was required and was part of the restructure of the army. It is true that there has been a ministerial statement, with one speaker on each side, about Army 21. I have to say that the main committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          pleased to receive its first briefing on the matter.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is a sore point with me for two reasons. The ministerial statement on restructuring was very brief and gave few details. Although some may feel that is an unfair criticism, no documentation was presented with the report. The briefing yesterday has posed as many questions as it has provided answers. I am not coming at it as someone who is opposed to Army 21.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I am really interested to know whether the minister can assure the House that the Public Works Committee has been adequately briefed on the restructure of the army. Certainly, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade would not consider it has been adequately briefed. If the minister cannot provide that assurance to the House, how then can he move this motion? I think that all members of the House, particularly those that take an interest in defence, should be given the opportunity to come to grips with and understand what underpins the most radical restructuring of the army in 50 years.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not want to labour the point. I just want to put my concerns on the record. They are not negative; they are to seek information. But, with the minister stating to honourable members in the House that this is part of the army's restructure, and my knowledge that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has not adequately been briefed, how can he assure the House that the Public Works Committee has? I do not oppose the motion.

         The Department of Defence proposes to develop the Townsville field training area to allow subunits, units and formations to conduct collective training in manoeuvre and live fire training activities. This proposal will allow army to develop the area to improve training and to ease the environmental pressure on the currently used training area. The proposal will provide fencing and warning signs; office accommodation for the range control organisation; communications facilities and access road; basic infrastructure for a 350&amp;hyphen;man camp; crossing points for creeks, roads and railways; and vehicle washpoints. The estimated outturn cost is $18.694 million. It is anticipated the construction will start in March 1997 and be completed by May 1999.

         The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 11 December 1996, concluded that, firstly, a need exists to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable elements of the  Australian Defence Force to undertake collective and joint training in live firing and manoeuvre at brigade level in the Townsville field training area. Secondly, of development options examined, the preferred option is the provision of infrastructure to support training at brigade level which will allow the range to be developed close to its maximum potential and provide training benefits within a realistic time frame and at realistic costs. Thirdly, the extent of the proposed development can be justified on the grounds of public safety, effective management and maximum use of the range in accordance with the user requirements and concepts for manoeuvre operations. Fourthly, the committee supports the use of army engineers on elements of the project which would provide training benefits and not directly compete with the private sector. Fifthly, design standards will conform with relevant codes, statutes and operational manuals and procedures, Sixthly, the committee recommends the development of infrastructure on the Townsville field training area at an estimated outturn cost of $18.694 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support and I commend the motion to the House.

        These are amendments to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 made by the Senate last night. The Senate made 17 amendments which have been circulated to honourable members this morning. These amendments in effect make six key policy changes

        Amendment No. 1 relates to the commencement provisions for the bill. Clause 2 of the bill as introduced provided for commencement on royal assent, with the exception of item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill, which would commence on the first day after the minority interest sale time. Amendment No. 1 substitutes a new clause 2, which provides for, firstly, the amendments to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to commence on 1 May 1997 and, secondly, the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to commence on royal assent.

New clause 2 also removes the special commencement provisions in clause 2 of the bill in relation to item 25 of schedule 1.

        Amendment No. 17, the last one, omits item 25 of schedule 1 of the bill, thereby retaining the power of the direction in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act. This statutory power has never been exercised. It is the government's expectation that any public interest controls would be exercised through regulatory mechanisms which apply to all carriers and that, if the Commonwealth sought to exercise any control over Telstra in its capacity as a shareholder, it would do so by exercising the rights attaching to the two-thirds of the shares which it owned not by exercising the power of direction. As I mentioned at the commencement of remarks, the government is prepared to accept the amendments made by the Senate and hopes for speedy passage in this place.

         —The Labor Party will be supporting each of the 17 amendments made by the Senate. In particular, we were pleased that amendment No. 17 was carried in the Senate and we are pleased to support it in the House of Representatives. As the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) has just mentioned, amendment No. 17 relates to the power to give ministerial directives to the board of Telstra. The Labor Party sees that power as an essential third tier in the safety net, guarding public interest concerns about the operation of Telstra—particularly with regard to regional Australia.
        </para>

       <para first-indent="16">
        The first tier of the safety net for regional Australia is public ownership. One of the very sad aspects of the government's decision to privatise one-third of Telstra is that the people of Australia are losing their full public ownership of the great telecommunications company of this land. Nothing is sadder than the loss
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of public ownership of the infrastructure for the information superhighway.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If there is one aspect of Telstra that should absolutely be held in public hands, it is the cables and the pipes of Telstra, because they are the essential infrastructure for the information superhighway. As our society moves more and more towards an information society, it is essential that public ownership of the pipes and cables be maintained.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second tier of the safety net for regional Australia is section 183, something that was used effectively, interpreted as such by the former minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). The interpretation of the new government has changed, because they are reading section 183 in tandem with section 185. Two days ago the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, in the MPI debate, said this:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . section 183 fundamentally says there shall not be a price discrimination except in certain circumstances under the exemptions, and 185A is one of the exemptions—that is, where a carrier can show that there are cost justification reasons for doing so. Quite clearly, it costs a lot more to provide call systems in remote or regional areas than it does in some closely populated urban areas, and that is why the exemption is there.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a statement of laissez&amp;hyphen;faire. That is a statement of the government's determination to see Telstra operate according to solely commercial grounds in private ownership and disregard the universal service obligations that have been put in place to protect regional Australia and regional telephone consumers. In tandem with the government's determination, initially, to abolish the ministerial directives, the Howard government was wiping out each of the three tiers of the safety net for regional Australia in telecommunications: public ownership—gone; 183—reinterpreted to read as a charter for laissez&amp;hyphen;faire operations for Telstra; and ministerial directives—gone. Each of the three tiers of the safety net, carefully constructed by the former Labor government, was going to be abolished by this government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Out of the terrible decision of the Senate and the terrible sell&amp;hyphen;out by the Independent senators in that place, one thing at least has been salvaged; that is, the third tier of the
        <break page="8363" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         safety net—the ministerial directives and how they will need to be applied under the new ownership arrangements for Telstra. As this government moves towards the commercial charter, those ministerial directives will need to be applied to safeguard the public interest, to safeguard the idea of universal service provision in regional Australia.

        We all understand how there is pressure now for a differential local call rate in Australia. Optus have moved to the 20c local call in the elite affluent parts of Sydney, and is planning to do so for the same types of suburbs in Melbourne. But under this government that is not an opportunity which will be made available to regional Australia. This government is basically saying that the policy guideline for adoption is user pays. If there is an extra cost for regional Australia, a cost not experienced on the north shore of Sydney, then that cost for regional Australia should be covered with a user&amp;hyphen;pays philosophy. That is a shameful reversal of the principles of universal service obligation and access that the former government had in place. The ministerial directives need to be maintained.

         I am not a lawyer—I am an engineer—but I do know that when judges have to make decisions on legislation that is passed by the parliament, they sometimes take account of what ministers say. Given the fact that this minister, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), and this government have tried to frustrate our at tempts to retain that power of direction in the hands of the minister, I hope that any judge that is making a future decision about the legality of these issues will take account of the views not just of the government and this minister but also of the parliament.

        The fact that the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government is at the dispatch box this morning accepting this amendment means that their party and their government is accepting that the minister for communications will retain that right, that power of direction. There is no point in the minister for sport trying to use some weasel words—as he did in his earlier remarks this morning—by saying that in some way the government is only going to be entitled to the rights that they are entitled to as the owners of certain shares in the company. Minister, there is no point in trying to use your words in this debate to in some way undermine the amendment that you are accepting. What this amendment does is give the minister for communications the power to issue a direction to Telstra.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we had not been successful in the Senate, the minister for communications could not have issued directions, because that would have been oppressing the minority shareholders. Even though the government has two-thirds of the shares, you cannot oppress the minority shareholders. If this government allows Telstra—whether it is one-third privatised or not—to take certain decisions, here are a few examples where we would be calling on the minister to use that power of direction.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If Telstra tried to introduce charging for directory assistance, that would be a breach of the undertakings given by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber earlier this year. We would be in here calling as loudly as we could for the government to issue a directive to Telstra to stop the introduction of such charges. If the power of direction were not there, the public could not rely on the government to use its two&amp;hyphen;third shares to ensure that there would be no charge for directory assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second example is the one we have been talking about this week. If there were an
        <break page="8364" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         attempt to introduce differential local call charges across the country, we would demand that the minister issue a directive to Telstra. After 1 July 1997, under the government's new legislative regime, if the government does away with section 183 in the act that prohibits discriminatory pricing, and if the government tried to allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls only in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne where Optus is competing, we think that would be against the public interest.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We think it would be wrong for the people who live in the other suburbs of Sydney to also not get access to a 20c local call. It would be wrong for them to be paying 25c if the residents of Chatswood, Hunters Hill and other places in the Prime Minister's electorate were to get 20c local call rates. It would be wrong for the residents of Launceston, in the minister's own electorate, to keep paying 25c if Telstra customers in the affluent suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne had the benefit of that lower charge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They are just two examples of why we think it is imperative that even a part&amp;hyphen;privatised Telstra operates in a regime where the minister for communications retains the power to direct. The minister can only use that directive after he follows certain procedures, so the minister has to be accountable to this parliament.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point I want to make is that, in accepting these amendments, the government are accepting that they are going to have this responsibility in future years. There is no point in the minister in his contribution today trying to argue in some way that the power of the minister is limited to the power of the representative shareholder who owns that two-thirds share. That is something I would appreciate the minister conceding in his future remarks in this debate.

         —It does not surprise me that the member for Dobell should take a point of order because this cuts right to the heart. The member for Dobell realises that this is yet another example of the tentacles of the Left infiltrating the fair and forthright tentacles of the Right within the Labor Party—those tentacles that are saying, `Listen, let's have a responsible commercial approach to this sale.' But no, they have to retain the discretion on the part of the minister, which has absolutely zero effect, because they know, as we know, that the discretionary power has never been used. Yet when it comes to the float of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra, the tentacles of the ALP will cost the Australian taxpayers

        The most important point is that we are going to support this amendment because, in the broader interests of the Australian people, one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra has to be sold. It is not because the enterprise can do with some private sector interest. It is not just because governments should not be in the business of running telecommunications companies. It is because we want to make a $1.2 billion commitment to the environment. It is the Labor Party that is continually talking up the environment and then undermining it, talking up telecommunications, getting services out to the bush and getting services to the people in most need, and then taking the rug out from underneath them.

        As the member for Dobell knows, the ALP has done absolutely nothing for the people in most need in terms of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas of Australia. Yet the hypocrisy which has filled this chamber and the Senate over the last few months whilst the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill has been debated has been overwhelming when it comes to the lack of commitment by the Australian Labor Party to, firstly, a commercial enterprise and, secondly, getting services to those most in need.

        The member for Dobell talked about cheaper phone calls for the city and the people in the bush not getting the opportunity for cheaper phone calls. As part of the overall telecommunications package which was introduced by my colleague the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), people in the bush are going to get a fair go, and they are going to get a fair go through competition.

        It is worth looking at this whole issue in the way that these people opposite are trying to portray it. To back up their arguments, they got their majority with the socialists of the Democrats and others to put up a second report on cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy  and all the problems

        Whatever the accounting difficulties, the Committee still supports the present cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is crucial to distinguish between `cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy' and `profitability'. Telecom customers in high&amp;hyphen;cost areas are not necessarily unprofitable for Telecom. They contribute less per service than users in low&amp;hyphen;cost districts but their contribution to Telecom's revenue is still positive. Non&amp;hyphen;metropolitan customers of Telecom in 1984&amp;hyphen;85 paid for all the direct costs incurred in their districts as well as for $433.8 million of Telecom's total indirect costs.

        A further benefit to the system provided by urban and remote users which may be offset against the costs of their service lies in what economists call an `access externality'. Put simply, this means that the value of telecommunications systems to any particular user will increase as the total number of users with whom he or she can communicate increases.

        In other words, it takes two phones to make a telephone call and a lot of people would not buy a metropolitan service if they could not ring people in the country. They are not my words.

         Then we have this problem that we have to have ministerial control because of jobs. I see that the matter of public importance yesterday was, `If you privatise National Rail there'll be a loss of jobs.' That raises one simple question: if a private operator is going to reduce the number of employees on the grounds of efficiency in the national interest, in the taxpayer's interest, why has it not happened already? Why are you, as the representatives of the taxpayer, demanding unnecessary jobs?

I really did not believe all those stories I had heard about the Australian Labor Party saying one thing in this House and then going out into the electorate and saying something else. I really did not believe it. But, gee whiz, have I had a rude shock.

         —The member for Werriwa was talking about the fact that Telstra would be worth more some time in the future if it were to be sold. Can I give the member for Werriwa a little tip? The all&amp;hyphen;ordinaries index of the share market is travelling at somewhere around 2,150 points. When the ALP sold the Commonwealth Bank, the initial tranche was around 1,600; when they sold Qantas into the market, it was probably around 1,800.

         understand—usually the market continues to grow. It is a good idea to sell into a rising market. It is only the ALP that tends to sell into falling markets. Initiatives such as the amendment—an amendment which makes it uncommercial—to give a power of direction to the minister do have a detrimental effect on the share price. But this government will even address the problem that has been given to us by the Australian Labor Party.

        Firstly, we have said that, if we are to try to have some direction on Telstra, we will use the regulatory powers to do so, in the same way that we would have that effect on Optus or any other provider that comes into play after 1 July next year. Secondly, we will not do what the ALP does: we will not be abject hypocrites. We will not come into this chamber and say, `Listen, we're not going to tell you about anything we do not do.' We are saying that we are selling one-third of Telstra now, and we will go back and make a pledge to the Australian people about further sales down the track.

        Before I put a few questions to the minister, perhaps I could respond to some of the provocative remarks that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), who seeks to describe our attempts to retain the minister's power to direct Telstra as—to quote his words—`the tentacles of socialism'. It is
        <break page="8371" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the tentacles of socialism to allow the Minister for Communications to block Telstra if they want to introduce a charge for directory assistance.

        It is the tentacles of socialism if we try to help the constituents of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and make sure that his constituents do not pay more for a local call than the residents of Chatswood. It is a terrible thing, this tentacles of socialism, isn't it? We could almost imagine Jack McEwen being one of the greatest devotees of the tentacles of socialism as described by the honourable member for North Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is just ridiculous for the honourable member for North Sydney to try to describe an amendment that his own minister and his own party are accepting as the tentacles of socialism here today. He seeks to say that the issues we are raising can, in some way, be dealt with through the normal regulatory powers. He nods his head in agreement with that. He is agreeing with himself.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The problem he has not yet understood is that the telecommunications competition regime that his government has announced does not protect the subscribers in the way that they should. His government's telecommunications regime will allow Telstra to drop the price of local calls in his electorate, and Telstra will not be forced to drop the price of local calls in Bathurst in the electorate of Calare, or in Gladstone in the electorate of Hinkler, or even in Launceston in the electorate of the minister at the table. That is what the government's regulatory powers do not cover. That is why we say that, ultimately, the minister should be held accountable.

        In case people think that, in some way, the Labor Party is exaggerating the risk, let me remind the House that 10 days ago the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) also thought these protections were there. The Prime Minister misled his own party room when he gave this pledge, according to the

        First of all, if Telstra does seek to introduce a charge for directory assistance, will the government use the minister's power of direction to stop them?

Thirdly, will the minister also give us an assurance that, if Telstra acts in any way that is against the public interest, the minister will issue a direction?

        That is the sort of hypocrisy we have in the establishment of this fraud. I have argued strongly, as did Senator Kernot when she took up this argument, that we should have established a $250 million per year quarantined fund for the environment if we had any real commitment to the environment. I have argued for the retention of Telstra on a jobs basis in regional Australia, as a community service obligation and as a cross-subsidisation factor to the telephony services which will not be delivered in a private market and will not be delivered by market forces because the profit margin is just not out there.

        I think the export earnings we could have earned from a publicly retained Telstra are obvious.

But, unfortunately, the Australian shareholders, those who own those shares now in that publicly owned corporation will not enjoy that. That is the price. That is what we have given away and that is why I am so impassioned not only about the destruction of this publicly owned institution but also that the billion dollar fund is a fraud.

In believing in the sale of Telstra they are wrong because they are ripping away the tiers of the safety net that provide protection for people in regional Australia in the basic service of telecommunications. They are ripping away the first tier of the safety net—public ownership—and ripping away the second tier by talking down instead of talking up the provisions and use of section 183.

         —In winding up my presentation on the Flags Amendment Bill, I would just like to retrace what I have said. Flags have been around since 1122BC and have always been the insignia of leadership. We have talked about
         <break page="8377" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the development of the Australian flag from its earliest manifestations in the era of 1606—I traced it from then right through to today. I point out too that that has carried with it the development of our legal and parliamentary codes, and for that reason the flag has a very important position in our democracy.

        There is one aspect that I have not spoken about that I would like to touch on briefly before I finish. That is, the flag, as an insignia of leadership, as the embodiment of the history and the character of the nation, is the thing that we carry into battle. Although the flag perhaps does not have the same significance in this mechanised and atomic age that it might have had in the past, it is still very much an important symbol to those who have served in the Australian forces.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The flag was always used as a symbol of identifying friend or foe. It was a rallying point—was it not?—in battles. Even as recently as the Second World War, there were a number of occasions where battles were turned with some young soldier racing forward with the national flag, a banner, and using that as a rallying point for troops. For that reason, one can understand that the many RSL sub-branches around Australia have a great affection for this flag. The people they represent have played a significant part in defending that flag not just with words and not just with deeds but with their sheer physical effort, many times with their imprisonment and still, more importantly, on many occasions with their lives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Last year during the Australia Remembers activities I met with RSL clubs in little communities like Eidsvold, Monto, Childers, Gin Gin, Miriam Vale, Calliope, Biloela, even those in little mining towns like Moura and those in the bigger centres like Bundaberg and Gladstone. I noticed that wherever I went there was a universality of affection for our flag and what it represented. Therefore, if we are planning to change the flag, we need to have mechanisms in place that ensure that the Australian population as a whole has a say in how that would happen.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         has been the way many people, including the former Prime Minister, have made light of our symbols, criticised them overseas and played with them in the parliament. With this Flags Amendment Bill 1996, we have laid down very clearly once and for all that this flag can be changed only by a majority of the electors in the states and territories and that they must be given a choice between the current Australian flag—the one that is viewed with so much affection—and other flags, and that whichever flag is chosen will become the flag of this country. It also provides the mechanisms whereby such a referendum would occur, and they appear under proposed subsection 3(2) and proposed subsection 3(3) of the bill.

        Finally, although I have a great affection for this flag—I recognise the price in blood that has been paid to defend it, I recognise the history that it contains, I recognise the character that it embodies—if under this bill a majority of Australians decide they do want to change it, I will be satisfied that it is a full and frank expression of the national will, and that is something that I would readily embrace. In the meantime, I believe that we have been well served by this flag and that it should be retained and be recognised with a place of honour in this nation.

Following on from the comments of the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in which he displayed his affection for the flag, I too concur with those comments that the Australian flag—although it has been officially with us in terms of being proclaimed only since 1953—is a flag which has certainly touched the hearts and won the affection of all Australians.

What happened in 1953 was merely a formalisation of what had taken place in previous years. The current Australian flag flew over the site for the national capital as early as 1908, on the first ships of the new navy in 1910 and at the first Australian base on the Antarctic continent—that white expanse to our south—in 1911. Since 1953, it has been flown continuously by all our territories and states, including the Australian Antarctic bases.

        It is fair to say that all Australians will now have a chance to decide on the change to one of the most important national symbols—our flag. The history of the flag must also be recognised and mentioned in this debate. I would like to refer in part to it. When six Australian colonies federated to form a single Commonwealth on 1 January 1901, a new nation was born and a new century was heralded. At that time there was an urgent demand for a new emblem. An official competition was arranged for a design which attracted 32,823 entries. Five of these, which submitted almost identical designs, were placed equal first. Apart from later changes in the magnitudes of the stars and the number of points, they produced the present Australian flag. The new flag heralded Australia's entry into nationhood.

        The flag is an important symbol that has been flown in this country for many years. One of the most symbolic displays of the Australian flag is often attributed to sporting events and, in particular, to the Olympic games. It is interesting to note that since 1908 it has been raised for medal winners at every Olympic Games—a long tradition with this nation and a tradition that must be upheld.

When you unfurl the flag to have a photo taken, you can see the beam on their faces. They have great pride at being Australian and in being able to take this symbol overseas. The students that I presented with flags have gone to countries such as Germany, the United States, Italy, Spain and Portugal—some have gone to the Paralympics. They have all had the flag to take with them as a reminder of their nation, their culture and their identity. The exchange students have used the flag as a gift for their host families.

        I have spoken about the symbolism of the flag in the past. As we are becoming more global and opening up our borders—we see this in Europe and with the various trade pacts with NAFTA and APEC—we are becoming a more unified world. It tends to make us want to revert to some of the more tribal and more traditional ties that we have. We see this taking place in Europe. I refer particularly to the regionality that is taking place, whether in Italy, Spain, Holland or eastern Europe. As the borders are coming down people are looking for symbols and ties and they say, `Yes, I am European or Australian or American.' They can then say that they are from a particularly territory. In Spain they are Catalonians. In northern Italy we are starting to see the emergence of the Northern

As someone who does not come from Ireland, Scotland or England and does not have any ancestors from that particular part of the world, but whose ancestors are from Europe, I look at the flag as an entire entity. I do not consider the flag to be broken up into three separate components. I consider the flag in its entirety. I look at it and say, `That is my flag.' I am proud of that flag. I do not say, `There is the Union Jack in the corner. I cannot have that because I am not British.' That is an absurd argument. It reflects on where we have come from.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          people. They had in the past made various changes to national symbols and national colours without proper reference to the people. While I did not disagree with many of those decisions, I believe that the people should always be consulted on these matters.

        There has been a tactic around to denigrate the Union Jack, as it is sometimes called, taking up a quarter of the flag in the top-left hand corner. It has been a symbol ridiculed by some.

        We are basically still an Anglo&amp;hyphen;Celtic country, though that is changing, and there is nothing wrong with that. But the system of justice that we have in this country that has served us so well, for all its faults, comes from the United Kingdom. Our system of democracy, which I will admit we sometimes take too much for granted in this country, largely comes from that part of the world. Our system of education, for all its faults, comes from that part of the world. The language that we predominantly speak in this country, our official language—the English language—comes from that part of the world.

        Some people think it means that we are somehow subservient or still tied to the apron strings of England, that it is a thing of shame, that it represents a cultural cringe in this country. While I can see some validity in that argument, I think it means quite the reverse. It should show, if it does not, that we are a mature society, that we are very confident in ourselves and that we are Australians.

        I would also like to comment on the fact that it is a very beautiful flag. I had not fully appreciated that, I have to say, until this debate sprang up in the last decade or so and I looked at some of the suggestions that have been put forward if we are going to change our flag to another flag. For the first time in my life I realised how difficult it is to design a flag which is acceptable to everyone and, at the same time, pleasing to the eye.

        Some of the suggestions put up, for example, by the Ausflag competition are quite ludicrous. Most countries in the world—I have only just consciously come to realise—have only two or three stripes running horizontally, vertically or, sometimes, diagonally across their flag. With the odd exception, such as France, which is well known because of the Tricolour—the red, white and blue—you would not have the faintest idea which country those flags represent. It is very confusing indeed. They seem to have every combination of colour running in every possible direction for no particular reason.

         Ours is a very distinctive flag. There are not that many countries in the world that have very distinctive flags with symbols on them which actually mean something, which represent the people who live in the country and their traditions. One of the latest flags to be designed is the present flag of South Africa, which is very distinctive. It is a very complex flag, but it represents the many peoples who live in that country and the things that that country stands for. I think that is a very good flag. It is an example where a flag that has been changed with very good reason seems to be working very well.

It is a valid point, but I do not necessarily think we should change our flag because it is similar to the flag of some other country.

         Before I finish my speech, I would like to make some comments on another phenomenon that is sometimes associated with our flag—that is, the fact that some people, on occasion, choose to desecrate our flag.

         If they are doing it because they do not like the flag, I think that they should lobby legitimately in a democratic country to change the flag in a proper and a mature way. If they are doing it because they are championing some other cause, then I believe that they should not use the flag in this way, because it offends many people. We should respect the flag, whatever else we might think of it, and we should respect the thoughts of others. Some say it is just a piece of cloth. If you say that it is just a piece of cloth, you have not got a soul. It represents much more than that.

For example, Mexico's flag includes the red of Spain, France's flag includes white for its monarchy, and the state of Hawaii's flag also features the Union Jack despite America's independence from England more than 200 years ago. We cannot ignore our history while, at the same time, we cannot be restrained by it.

        A flag is the symbol of a nation. It is meant to unite a nation and last throughout the centuries. It is not meant to be a reflection of a country in its present state and change according to the trends of the time. What if another flag were chosen and in 100 years it too was deemed irrelevant. Would it too be cast aside in favour of a more trendy alternative?

         —I wish to enter the debate briefly. I want to make a number of points in relation to the matters that have been raised in the course of the debate on the Flags Amendment Bill. The question of national emblems is very important. The right of the people of the nation to determine those national emblems is equally important. That is why I am happy to support this bill, but I think it is important that people realise in that context that some of the historical anecdotes that have been raised today tend to be a little selective.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I support this bill. It gives the Australian people the right to vote on the flag, a right which they have never had before. In the history of this country, people have never before had the opportunity to vote to select the flag that we now fly as the national flag;
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         nor, for that matter, to select any other flag that they might prefer in its place.

        The member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) referred to the competition that was run at the turn of the century and the fact that that competition endorsed two flags, a red and a blue ensign. She also referred to the fact that there were five different competitors who basically put forward the same design. One of the interesting things about that is that one of those five was not an Australian at all; he was a New Zealander, a Kiwi. That might explain why our two flags are so similar. As the shadow minister at the table, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), commented to me a little while ago, it has in fact happened in the past at Olympic ceremonies, when Australia has won the medal, that they have hoisted the New Zealand flag. That is a point of confusion which occurs not only at Olympic Games, I might add. Were we to take the New Zealand flag to a number of places in Australia and present it as the Australian flag, I suspect few would be keen enough to notice the difference.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another interesting link that this flag has with New Zealand, arising from that early competition, is this question about a six&amp;hyphen; or a seven&amp;hyphen;pointed star. We refer to that as signifying the states and territories, but on 4 September 1901 the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        reported:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Should it ever happen that the people of New Zealand change their mind and decide to enter the union, a very slight alteration would enable the flag still to stand. It will only be necessary to place a seven&amp;hyphen;pointed star instead of a six&amp;hyphen;pointed one beneath the Union Jack.
       </para>
       <para>
        The simple fact is that the history of the flag and the history of the star identify that people who are not Australian were involved in its creation. In fact, the thought of a seven&amp;hyphen;pointed star at the time of its adoption in 1901 had to do with New Zealand's involvement as part of the Commonwealth of Australia rather than any consideration that is now attributed to the seven&amp;hyphen;pointed star.

        The other thing which I think is important to note is that in the course of the debate a good deal has been said about the flag having been proudly carried by Australian troops in battle, and that is indeed true. But, of course,
        <break page="8388" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         it is not the only flag that Australian troops have carried into battle since Federation. During the First World War it was just as common for Australians to fight under the red ensign as it was to fight under the blue ensign. Indeed, it was just as common for them to fight under the British flag as it was to fight under either of those two Australian flags. Even in the Second World War, many Australian troops fighting in Australian formations fought not under the blue ensign but under the red ensign. My father, who served in New Guinea, served in a unit which fought under the red ensign. There is any number of ex&amp;hyphen;service personnel and records that will attest to that fact.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So why do we have the blue ensign today as our national flag? It is not because the people of Australia had a vote on it. They did not in 1901, and they have not since. The reason we have the Australian flag as a blue ensign is that a group of politicians in the Australian parliament in 1953 legislated to make it so. In other words, the high ground, principled position that I have heard so many members in this chamber, particularly from the government side, espouse about the terrible evil of allowing politicians to determine this matter has glossed over the fact that it was precisely that mechanism that arrived at the current flag as our national flag. The process that has been denigrated is precisely the process which was used in adopting the current flag.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I said at the outset that I support these changes, and I do, because I think it is important that the people of the country do have the right to determine these matters. But let us get some modicum of balance into this debate and let us understand that the flag we have today was never adopted by the Australian people. We are quite properly giving that authority to the Australian people today, but we need to be realistic and honest about the past and we need to be honest about the flag we have today. It is important, and it is an important symbol of our nation, but let us be honest in recounting on the record here in the parliament exactly how it came to be our national emblem. It was not adopted by the people; it was not arrived at by decision of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australians alone. The seven&amp;hyphen;pointed star was not something that was intended to accommodate territories; it was intended to accommodate New Zealand.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The simple fact is that the flag is confusing in other parts of the world when Australians winning a gold medal at the Olympics have stood under the New Zealand flag. As the country moves forward into its second century of nationhood, we as a nation might have a mature debate both about the real history of the development of our emblems but, more importantly, what it is we see for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren as the enduring emblem for them into the future of a unique Australia.

As I travelled with those Vietnam veterans and the widows of veterans who fought in Vietnam, that moment that I stood with them at a service at Nui Dat, where our task force headquarters were, gave me a much greater understanding of the price that was paid by so many hundreds of thousands of Australians who paid the supreme sacrifice defending freedom around the world and fighting for our flag. It just means so much to those people. The price that was paid really struck me as I stood at that small service on 18 August this year at Nui Dat in Vietnam.

        For those who have served this country in times of war and conflict, and for those who stand ready to serve it today—and that is important; they stand to serve it should they be needed—our flag is a very special symbol to them.

It also symbolises where they have come from and where they have been and where they are going, and when we think back through the annals of military history it has never been any other way.

Many young people, Australian and New Zealander backpackers, made their way out of their holidays to Turkey and then to Gallipoli for Anzac Day. To see them waving the Australian flag is another demonstration by the young people of Australia of their support for our Australian flag and what it means to them. They were clearly taking time out of a European holiday to be on Anzac Day at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli.

So often in the sporting arenas we see people linking themselves to the Australian flag because of what the Australian flag means to them. It is a symbol. It is a national symbol. To see athletes at the Olympic Games proudly collecting an Australian flag and draping it around their shoulders and doing a victory lap of an arena or of a swimming stadium clearly demonstrates that it is a national symbol and one that should not be tampered with.

        If I can turn to a point that was raised in the debate by a number of members, particularly by the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) in his speech, where the constitutional validity of this legislation was contested. Some members opposite have suggested that the bill may lack validity because it attempts to construct a different legislative power to section 1 of the constitution. That section, of course, vests legislative power in the federal parliament consisting of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives and they thought this might have happened by the inclusion of the Australian people in the above legislature.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Can I assure members that the government is satisfied that the bill as drafted is constitutionally valid. The member for Reid also—I thought quite mischievously—sought to raise doubts as to whether, if a vote for a new flag does occur, there would be any significance in the way the votes are counted. The explanatory memorandum and the bill are quite clear, and I restate it for the sake of clarity: a new flag can be adopted if and only if a majority of all electors voting nationally vote for a new flag. The government's intention is that any vote on whether to adopt a new flag shall be on the basis of a national vote counted on a national basis. It does not matter how the majority view stacks up in the various states and the territories. The government believes that the choice of a national flag is not one which affects the balance of power between the Commonwealth and the states, as may occur with a change to the constitution. Rather, it goes to the issue of how we express our national identity, which is a decision for the will of the Australian people acting as a whole.

        The member for Reid and the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) drew attention to the fact that the bill makes no provision for variations to the flag should the Northern Territory become a state. The Commonwealth star has consisted of seven points since 1908—one point for each of the states and the seventh point to represent all of Australia's
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         territories. The Commonwealth star is an integral part of the flag. In fact, it is a national symbol of significance in its own right. Its symbolism has been widely adopted in Commonwealth heraldry, as it formed part of the original Commonwealth coat of arms granted in 1908 and the present arms granted in 1912. It is found in the insignia of many of the elements of the Australian system of honours and awards, and one example of this is on the uniforms of the Australian Federal Police. The government's position is quite clear: given the significance of the Commonwealth star, the Australian people should also be consulted before any change is made.

        Another area of concern was raised under section 8 of the Flags Act. Some of the opposition members oppose the retention of section 8 of the Flags Act, which states that nothing in the Flags Act affects the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack. Clause 8 has no bearing on the bill's objective, which is to ensure that the Australian people alone approve a new national flag. There is absolutely nothing in the Flags Act or this bill which prevents people from flying, subject to flag protocol, any Australian flag or, frankly, the flag of any nation.

        In her speech, the member for Prospect suggested that the government had failed to act on the concerns of many Australians that thousands of British subjects who are not yet Australian citizens would be eligible to vote on whether or not to change the flag. She has not, however, urged such a course herself. I think she is probably too experienced for that. In 1981 the Commonwealth and the states agreed that Australian citizenship should be the basis of the right to vote in Australian federal and state elections but that non-Australian citizens who already enjoyed the vote should retain it. These persons included citizens not only of the United Kingdom but of nearly 50 members of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Republic of Ireland.

        This bill is about enfranchising all elements of the Australian community in decisions about the national flag. Frankly, the government is not interested in proposals to disenfranchise certain groups of people from this decision. The government believes that all

         —This migration legislation, as I indicated previously, shows that the government believes that migrants are second&amp;hyphen;class citizens. It is an attack on fundamental family values and a repudiation of the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election commitments. I want to draw the attention of the House to the statements made by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) when he was the opposition spokesman on immigration when amendments were made to the Migration Act to make it plain that a minister could not cap visas. The present immigration minister, when he was opposition spokesman, said:

        They were his words in opposition. Yet what he is proposing with this legislation is precisely that.

        It is little wonder that in the Senate we saw a report concerning the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 which endorsed the many fears and concerns raised in submissions from church groups, from the Human Rights Commissioner, from the Australian Law Reform Commission and from others that what this legislation, amongst other things, would do is, firstly, breach Australia's international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child; secondly, represent a significant withdrawal from Australia's lawful commitment to the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Sex Discrimination; thirdly, increase the potential for corruption; and, finally, it would be an admission that the government's proposed legislation would be discriminatory and would breach Australia's international undertakings. Those are the concerns that have been expressed by people in the community who are aware of the provisions of this bill.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It ought to be said very clearly that this bill is not about levels of migration. We in opposition have made it clear on a number of occasions that we have no argument with the government about the size of the program that it announced for 1996&amp;hyphen;97. The minister went to some pains in his media release at the time he announced the program to say that the size was about the average of the last four years of the Labor government—and, indeed, it is. But that fact makes a lie of the cries that Labor allowed the immigration program to get out of control.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="8393" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         It is also important to note there was no hint of the coalition's cry about Labor allowing the program to get out of control during the election campaign—not at all. In fact, the coalition committed itself specifically in giving priority to family reunion—as com pared with what it is trying to do now—within a program of a similar size to that which Labor had managed.

        Some of the statements made by government members during this and other debates on migrants and race have been described by one commentator in the broader debate as `dog whistling'. That is, the message is coded and pitched at a certain frequency to which a particular audience will be attuned but it can be denied whenever necessary. It is most regrettable that some government members have indulged in this practice, endeavouring to send out what are effectively coded, racist messages to those in the community who are receptive to such messages. I think most members of the House would reject that sort of approach.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It should also be noted that some government members have claimed that the power to cap these visa levels was put in place by the previous government. That is not the case. If that power exists at all under the current legal framework, it would certainly give rise to legal contention and controversy and would require some implementation of regulations to accompany it. We need to put on record that no government previously explored the existence of such a provision or sought to cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted in any one year. So let there be no mistake that capping the spouse visa has nothing to do with immigration as such.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It means that Australians will not have the right to choose to marry the love of their life. That will be restricted by the government setting a number of spouse visas that can be issued each year. So, if you make that decision early in the life of the program and visas are still around, you can be in luck, but too bad if you meet that person or make that decision later in the visa cycle. The answer may well be, `Sorry, no more visas for spouses this year. Try again next year. Better luck next year.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, that right to meet the responsibility of caring for our elderly parents—one which until now we have taken for granted—will be denied as well. The minister wants the power to say to Australians—citizens and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         permanent residents alike—that if their parents happen to live overseas only some will be able to meet that responsibility this year, and the same applies for dependent children.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In his second reading speech on the bill, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said this is crucial to restoring public confidence in immigration which had been greatly eroded under Labor and that Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control; yet when in opposition the same minister said that it would be unconscionable for a government to say midway through the year, `We have enough spouses in now. We will close off that category. No&amp;hyphen;one else will be allowed in this year.' So the minister's comments in opposition and his comments now are absolutely inconsistent and ought to be shown up as hypocrisy and pre&amp;hyphen;election rhetoric.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me also add our strong opposition to the introduction of the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill to roll the existing migration charges into one. The visa application fee will rise by over 250 per cent, the English education charge will go up by nearly 250 per cent—and there is the health services charge.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In particular, the English education charge increases are not acceptable to the opposition. Learning English is very much a part of the resettlement process. It is absolutely essential for people who have been granted the right to make this country their home under the claim of our non-discriminatory migration policy to be able to learn English. I draw the attention of the House to the coalition's policy description of English as `the glue of a cohesive nation'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But what are the coalition doing here? They want to raise the charge to $5,500 per person, thereby making it unaffordable to many. This plainly will discriminate against non-English speaking applicants. Also, it is completely inconsistent with that survey to which I have previously pointed that indicates most coalition MPs, most coalition candidates, regard the ability or capacity to speak English as an essential part of being truly Australian.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Therefore, the opposition opposes the increases to the English education charge. The
        <break page="8394" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government has rolled all these into one bill. They have refused to separate them out to enable the opposition to support those parts of this bill which we do not disagree with. It seems to me that, in so doing, they are playing politics with this issue.

        Let me further draw the attention of the House to what has happened in my own electorate as a result of the government's mismanagement of the migration program. A constituent who is a permanent resident engaged to a woman from Pakistan applied for a visa under the prospective spouse category. The government's decision to require sponsors to be Australian citizens rather than permanent residents saw that application rejected. But the Senate, in turn, defeated that unfair measure with the result that the constituent's fiancee can apply again, more certain that the application will be approved, but another application fee must be coughed up.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, a constituent who is a permanent resident seeking to bring her 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old Fijian son to Australia submitted her application, along with the necessary fee for which she had saved. She was quite confused and angry when told by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that her application had failed because she is not an Australian citizen. Before June and after October this would not have been a problem. But the bungled manner in which the government sought to amend the provision means that she too will have to line up with another application and another application fee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the government has done in relation to migration and what it is doing with the bill before the House do this nation's reputation no good in the eyes of prospective migrants who are confused and angry and who deserve a better explanation. This is typical of the way in which the Liberal Party has been treating migrants.

        The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki accords assert a universal right of immigration. However, there is no international disagreement about a government's right to determine who should be admitted to their country, at what rate, who should be granted citizenship and how many. There are fundamental moral and human rights issues associated with any immigration policy, true; and, yes, it is a fact that an individual's opportunities in life are profoundly affected by the lottery of their birth. Quite obviously, an infant born today in Zaire will have an entirely different life experience compared with that of an infant born on this same day in Canberra—and, of course, we would have to agree that that sounds unfair.

        But we cannot and do not live in an ideal world. All resources of every nation are finite. The argument in favour of national sovereignty control over immigration is commonsense. Anything else threatens the wellbeing of the host population and, in particular, the most vulnerable—the most recently arrived, the immigrants in the host nation. It is not surprising then that all governments carefully try to formulate and implement migration policies in an effort to protect their border security, economic wellbeing, political stability and cultural identity.

        Therefore, these amendments are important in that they give to our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs the ability to control our incoming numbers to ensure that the future economic and social wellbeing of all Australians is protected. The tools are necessary as a part of our forward planning so that we can deliver on our migrant intake policies. Australia, along with other countries like the USA and Israel, has been built on wave upon wave of migration.

        But whatever may be the interpretations that either side of politics would seek to place on these figures, can I make a couple of points. The first is that, if we want intelligent debate on unemployment in this country, we should stop making exaggerated claims in either direction about particular figures. I did not give a doom and gloom response to the figures a month ago. I am not today going to make an exaggerated claim because there has been a pleasing break in the other direction—it is a break, I must say, that was against some of the predictions. It does show a very solid employment growth. I mean, 24,000 at this time of the year is solid growth and I hope it can be continued. But, as the honourable member for Batman will know, these figures are notoriously unpredictable.

        I also take the opportunity to remind the House of a number of measures taken by the government which we believe will strengthen the employment outlook for Australians. We have put in place a fiscal consolidation strategy. We have seen significant reductions in interest rates. The combination of a cut in interest rates and better than expected employment figures on the eve of Christmas will boost consumer confidence. Boosting consumer confidence is a good thing for the economy because there is a psychological element involved in economic recovery. It is not all statistics. There is an element of psychology.

        We believe that the passage of the workplace relations bill will create more productive workplaces with higher productivity underpinning higher real wages. We have introduced a number of measures to help small business: the provisional tax uplift factor; the very generous changes to the fringe benefits tax regime; the abolition of the unfair dismissal law; and the injection from 1 January next year of an additional $1 billion of spending via the family tax initiative—all of these things together will work to produce a higher level of confidence and a greater disposition on the part of consumers to spend. I believe the lower interest rate climate will induce a greater desire on the part of people to invest.

        Can I finish the answer by saying, again, that I welcome these figures. They are good figures; they are not bad figures. They are a cause of feeling positive. But I say, as I did with figures that were commensurately less welcoming a month ago, nobody with any real understanding of this situation should place too much reliance on one month's figures. On both sides of the House I think there should be an absence of extravagant language and a willingness to understand that only over time can employment be boosted and unemployment reduced.

What is going to happen is that tens of thousands of Australians, for the first time, are going to have an opportunity to invest in Telstra. I can predict now that they will, I believe, support the sale of one-third of Telstra very strongly. This is going to generate enormous public interest.

Telstra has already been made fully aware of this employee share ownership plan which was announced by the coalition before the election and which I confirm today.

I also expressed concern to the members of the board—although I do not profess to have an instant answer to the problem—about the continuing high level of deaths in custody. This is an issue that I think concerns all Australians. It is a direct consequence of the high incarceration rate of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         indigenous people which, in turn, I think everybody will agree is a consequence of their deprived social circumstances, the absence of sound family and community structures and the alienation that many young people, black and white, feel within our community.

        As I say, I did not pretend to the ATSIC board that I had an instant solution to that—I do not think anybody does—but I did undertake that that would be something that would concern and preoccupy the government. I hope that over time some proposals to which the government is giving consideration can be put forth in that area, which I hope will be of some benefit. I very warmly welcome Mr Djerrkura to the board of ATSIC. I wish him and the other members of the ATSIC board well. I again assure him and the indigenous people of Australia of the goodwill of the government and our desire to work in a very constructive fashion with the members of the ATSIC board, naturally doing things differently from our predecessors but no less steadfastly pursuing the goal of greater justice, better treatment and certainly greater economic independence for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia.

        The difficulty with having two governments involved is that you get problems at the boundaries and you do not get sensible decisions being made. A very good example is what happens in Western Australia with palliative care. Western Australia probably has the best home based care service anywhere in Australia, provided by a group called Silver Chain. Silver Chain can provide palliative care for an average cost of about $50 per person per day in the last weeks of someone's life, even applying up to six hours of one&amp;hyphen;on&amp;hyphen;one care.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some 80 per cent of people who are dying would prefer to die at home. You have to ask yourself: if the majority of people who are dying would like to die at home, and if that can be provided for about $50 a day, why on earth are people still dying in state public hospitals? The simple answer is that the states pay for hospital care and the Commonwealth pays for palliative care, largely through the home and community care program—and the two cannot get together. In fact, in 1994 Silver Chain found 4,500 public hospital bed days where the only reason someone had gone to die in a public hospital at $500 a day was that the amount of money they were allowed to spend on palliative care had run out.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the sort of thing that happens when you have two levels of government that do not have any capacity for flexibility in boundary programs. So trying to sort out roles and responsibilities between the Commonwealth and state is driven by no more than trying to provide better and more flexible services to the public. Another good example is aged care, where we can give someone a nursing home bed at $32,000 a year but we cannot give someone $2,500 of continence aids to help their family keep them at home. This is very significant when so many people who
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        They are the sorts of things that drive the issue of trying to rationalise the roles and responsibilities in health, no more than that. Things can go wrong, as you found when you handed over immunisation to the states in 1987. That was a disaster. What went wrong then was that it was handed over without any responsibility. It was handed over without any monitoring. It was handed over and forgotten. I can assure you that anything we do in terms of roles and responsibilities will not be our just vacating the field; it will be our trying to rationalise how we can do things better and meet people's needs better.

That is an attitude that needs to be changed and I would imagine—in fact, I am confident—that there would be bipartisan support in this parliament for such a statement of attitude.

        Some comments have been made, both by way of interjection and in news reports this morning, that decisions that the federal government has taken in respect of legal aid sit oddly with any concern about the incidence of violence against women. Can I say a couple of things in relation to that, firstly to point out the respective roles of the Commonwealth and state governments when it comes to the provision of legal aid and that violence against the person is a crime punishable under state law.

        The Minister for Trade asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to review the issue to ensure our policies were still appropriate. Over a period of nearly two decades, China has clearly undergone profound economic reform and structural change in its transition from a centrally planned economy to a more market based system. Two cases which have come up recently—one concerning laminated glass and the other glyphosate acid—have provided an opportunity to scrutinise the prevailing market situation for those industries in China.

        Australian Customs officials visited China in October to undertake two in&amp;hyphen;country investigations on these products.

Their investigations do not mean that we have made a decision to change Australia's position with regard to China as a centrally planned economy or non-market economy. Such a specific determination is not in fact required under the Customs Act.

Previously, a number of operators were altering their engines so that they could run on light crude, thus evading the duty for those sorts of engines.

        The provision you sought advice on in regard to the mining industry is specific to the mining industry. The diesel fuel rebate covers a number of categories in the mining industry. It is a scheme designed to assist the international competitiveness of Australia's mining industry. If, in any case, a mining company were to sell their power generation and the power generation company sold power to a town site of any sort, that would not fit the category of eligible rebate criteria.

        It also means that the government can deliver on its three original aims of this legislation. The first is that we want to have better qualified GPs, which is in the Australian public's interest. Secondly, we want to have more doctors in country areas, which has been a chronic feature of the Australian health system in the past. Rural people have the right to have access to medical services. Thirdly, it contains growth in expenditure on MBS items.

        This fits in with what we undertook to do before the last election—that is, to improve the position of general practice. There have been a number of reports in recent years that have shown the parlous and difficult state that general practice in Australia is in. Peter Baume concluded in a work force study that general practice has been progressively
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         deskilled over the last 30 years. Bob Douglas from the ANU showed in research last year that a third of Australia's doctors would leave work tomorrow if there was something else they could do. This is very disturbing news for our basic, primary health care delivery service in Australia.

        This package will help the status and quality of general practice. It will mean that general practice no longer has to be the dumping ground for the entire medical profession. It builds on our budget initiatives whereby we reversed a decision prior to the election to take $400 million out of the better practice program. It builds on a decision whereby we have made general practice the centrepiece of coordinated care. As a result of that, 14 trials are now under way around Australia with the full support of divisions of general practice. It also builds on our decision to change referral mechanisms whereby general practitioners have to be the persons to whom specialists come back to so that someone can be the focus of patient care. All in all, it is good for the bush, it is good for general practice and it is good for the Australian public.

This is an improvement over previous years. In 1985 there were nearly 3,000 people killed on our roads. So we have been able to make some improvement to the road toll.

        It is important to us as well that we have IP which is owned in Australia so that we can enhance our exports.

The intellectual property on the submarines is owned by the Swedes, on the Anzac frigates it is owned by the Germans and on the minehunters it is owned by the Italians. Accordingly, we require R&amp;D to be done here in the development of indigenous intellectual property. Further in the line of personnel, we have had a completely difficult philosophical shift.

This family qualifies to receive only $8.70 per week from the government's tax package con, but the government's cuts to child care mean they will pay an extra $40 per week for child care.

          First of all, in relation to the family tax package, the Department of Social Security analysis does show that 80 per cent of families with dependent children will benefit from the family tax package. This is such a negative view. This is a person who says the glass is half empty instead of looking at it and saying it is half full. Our package is clearly aimed at benefiting families with dependent children in their vital role of raising their families.

His question of course goes to the heart of the major initiatives for which the employment, education and training portfolio has been responsible this year. The portfolio had the challenge, following the election, of addressing the major failures of the Labor government—a government which persisted in putting

          unemployed young people through demoralising programs which locked tens of thousands of qualified young people out of university places, which denied many thousands of young people jobs because they were unable to put into effect effective literacy and numeracy programs and denied many thousands of young people apprenticeship opportunities. The Labor Party failed in this area because they were always pursuing industrial and short&amp;hyphen;term political objectives.

Lastly, as time permits, we would propose—we will discuss this during the day with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean)—a grievance debate and 90-second statements, again, emphasising as time permits.

        In terms of the schedule for the Senate tomorrow, we understand that the Senate could sit as late as midnight tomorrow night or the very early hours of Saturday morning, which means that we will keep the House sitting until the Senate has completed and after the completion or adjournment of the Senate, because there may be a time lag between when matters finish in the Senate and then have to be transmitted to the lower house for completion. I cannot otherwise give members an indication of the likely completion and adjournment of the House but at this stage I do expect that it could easily be 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or even later on Saturday morning.

       I point out these things. The opportunity to vote on Telstra has come up three times in the last month in the Senate and only recently has the government chosen to take advantage of the fact to put it down. The second point is that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) is today moving an unprecedented guillotine of Senate business to ensure that Senate business is completed.

       This contrasts extraordinarily with the way in which we, when in government, were massively disrupted in the Senate by the other side. I also point out that this comes on top of extended evening sittings of the Senate, on top of extended days in the Senate and on top of two extra weeks in the Senate for consideration of government legislation, virtually all of which has arrived—including their budget legislation—in the latter stages.

        It is not a matter of the opposition doomsaying or a matter of point scoring; just a matter of stating the simple truth. The evidence is all around us. It is evident in the job figures, it is evident in the growth figures, it is evident in the consumption and retail sales figures and it is evident in about a dozen other indicators presently around. In particular, it is evident in what business leaders are presently saying about this government.

        I hope Mr Costello, the Treasurer, who—yes—is coming into the chamber, will have had the opportunity by now to read the full survey in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Business Review Weekly
        </emphasis>
        from which he partially quoted today. I think a little bit of that cinemascope smirk, that Panavision smirk, that Imax smirk, will be wiped off his face when he sees what the survey says about what 1,000 CEOs in this country think of the government's handling of the economy and of its economic performance.

        In the September quarter, with the triumph of optimism still overexperienced, you had 52 per cent of CEOs saying that the government's performance was good or very good. In the latest quarter survey reported in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         BRW
        </emphasis>
        this week, you have just 29 per cent of CEOs prepared to give the government and the Treasurer their endorsement for the management of the economy. As the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         BRW
        </emphasis>
        comments in the accompanying article, this is characterisable as nothing else than `a collapse of support in the business community for this government's economic management'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Treasurer will no doubt say, `How can you say all this in the context of today's
        <break page="8417" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         figures? Don't they tell a different, more optimistic story?' The short answer is they do nothing of the kind. The government has been a little bit inclined, as one would expect, to be triumphalist today about these figures and, on the face of it, improvement in the unemployment rate from 8.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent does give us all something to be reasonably pleased about. Whether it is enough to justify Senator Vanstone, the minister for employment, saying that we are beginning to see the benefits of the government's policy to bring about fundamental changes to the economy to create real jobs, however, is a marker she might well later regret having put down at this stage.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The truth of the matter is that, if there were signs in all of this that the economy was back on a growth path, that  unemployment was on the way down again and that the human misery associated with it was being reduced, we would all be delighted—not least those of us in the Labor Party because it is primarily our people, the people whom we support and stand for, who are affected by this. But there are still nearly 800,000 Australians unemployed; there are still 15,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were at the time of the budget.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is simply no foundation for optimism in today's figures. Let me say why. It is not a matter of taking the seasonally adjusted figures and attributing great significance to them, because they do jump around. The more appropriate figures to have regard to, as the Treasurer ought to be aware because his own minister for employment and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have acknowledged it, are the trend figures. Senator Vanstone has been saying all year—she first said it back in April—that not too much weight should be placed on month to month fluctuations in such a volatile series. The important thing is the underlying trend.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When you look at the trend figures for unemployment and employment you see a much less sanguine, less happy, story from that which the government is inclined to tell about the condition of the economy. Trend unemployment is rising and is at its worst level for two years—since 1994. The government appears on all the available evidence to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         have no chance whatsoever of achieving even its very modest budget forecast of a reduction in unemployment to 8¼ per cent by June next year. The Treasurer conceded as much in a speech he made earlier this week.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, when you look at trend employment you find it crawling along at 0.08 per cent a month. That is equal to annualised employment growth of just one per cent at the moment, just half the government's forecast for employment creation. More generally—and I hope the Treasurer will acknowledge this—labour force figures follow current economic activity with a lag. The current economic activity is very flat and there is nothing going on at the moment in the economy that can possibly give anyone any hope of a strong acceleration in employment growth this coming year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What do we know about current activity in the economy as a whole? What else do the statistics tell us about growth in the economy? Growth in the economy is running now at around two per cent. Last week's national accounts make that perfectly clear when you look at the trend figures and the recent quarters and extrapolate from them. Compare that two per cent with the 3&amp;half; per cent that was forecast in the budget and the four per cent growth that was averaged by the Labor Party in government over the last three years, the five per cent that was achieved by the Labor Party government in the year to March, and also the four to five per cent growth which your current leader, Prime Minister John Howard, last year said had to be achieved and sustained over the rest of the decade and beyond—four to five per cent—if we are to `make lasting inroads into unemployment.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        You are not getting four to five per cent; you are not getting 3&amp;half; per cent at the moment. You are getting not much better than just two per cent. The consequences of that for the condition of the economy and, in particular, the plight of the unemployed and those who fear they will be unemployed in the future are immense. The government says, and we will no doubt hear it again from the Treasurer, `It is not the right figure; the right figure is 3.8 per cent. Look at what the national accounts actually said.' But that is
        <break page="8418" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         3.8 per cent in the year through to the current quarter—the last quarter reported. Of that 3.8 per cent, 2.9 per cent was achieved as growth under Labor. The last two quarters have generated respectively just 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent for a grand total of 0.9 per cent.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Treasurer might be heard to say, as I think he was again in question time today, `Well, 0.8 per cent is really pretty good, isn't it? If we can multiply that over the next three quarters of this financial year we won't be doing real bad.' Well, you won't be doing real good because even if you were able to extrapolate in that way, that only gets you to 3.2 per cent which is still less than the miserly 3.5 per cent that you have hung your hat on for the budget. It is not enough to generate any kind of significant reduction in unemployment; it is just not a good enough performance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, there is every reason to believe that that 0.8 per cent will not be sustained. It is based, as you ought to be prepared to acknowledge, on a very high stocks build&amp;hyphen;up in this last quarter. Stock to sale ratios are the highest since December 1993 and, given what we know about private consumption at the moment, that stock build&amp;hyphen;up is not going to be drawn down in any significant way and these figures about growth are not going to be sustained. It is a gloomy picture so far as growth is concerned.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly with private consumption, the national accounts figures showed almost no consumption growth over the last quarter. Retail sales figures from the ABS a couple of weeks ago showed them falling for an utterly unprecedented three months in a row. Yesterday you did not know about it in question time when you were sprung with it. You dissimulated, you fudged and fiddled, but the Westpac&amp;hyphen;Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index showed consumer confidence falling a full 6.7 per cent—back below where it was at budget time and back below consumer confidence when the Labor Party was in office, before you came into government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is a devastating indictment of your management, given in particular that private consumption constitutes around 60 per cent of national expenditure. It makes a huge impact
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         on the economy. What about business investment? Is that going to make any difference? Does that tell a different story? The truth is that business investment has been holding up reasonably well in the aggregate. We acknowledge that. It may meet, alone of all these other figures—

         —Exactly, because when you look at it more closely you see it is being concentrated in those areas of the economy which we all know are not and never will be major employment generators. It is also the case that such investment as is occurring at the moment, as distinct from that which is contemplated, is a function by and large of the degree of confidence that was around at the beginning of the year when the Labor Party was still in office. You are residual beneficiaries of that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Moreover, because of the worries which presently do exist about private consumption being so weak and about company profitability having declined as much as it has, there is every reason to be concerned as to whether those predicted or expected levels of future investment will hold up. Again, in terms of its impact on the entire economy, it is around only 10 or 11 per cent of the total economic expenditure. Overwhelmingly, the muscle has to come from private consumption and that may well swamp any positive impact that business investment has to contribute.

        The interest rate cut which occurred yesterday was extremely welcomed, and it will do something—I hope, something significant—to redress the situation I have been describing. That is why we argued for it; that is why we have very warmly welcomed it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the point about it is that interest rate reduction confirms exactly what we have been saying about the economy: it is not a reward for good management of the economy by this government; rather, it is an overdue bail&amp;hyphen;out by the Reserve Bank for an economy which is manifestly in increasing distress.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are always two questions that have to be answered in the affirmative if you are going to justify an interest rate cut: does the
        <break page="8419" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         condition of the economy make it desirable; and, is the inflation environment or outlook such as to make it possible? Here, the answer was yes on both counts, because the inflation legacy of the Labor Party government is manifestly holding up—helped, it has to be said, by the stagnation of the economy at large. But everything else about the economy is flat, making it absolutely desirable—in fact, unavoidable—that that particular change should occur.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Everyone ought to be acutely aware—it is a simple truth of economic management—that you cannot rescue the economy, you cannot generate employment growth, by monetary or interest rate policy alone. You have to have a complementary budget and fiscal strategy. We in the Labor Party would say more than that; that you have to have a wages policy, a sensible approach to that part of the tripod of actions and policy responses.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government has not done that. The government's budget strategy has been totally misconceived in terms of the real problems of this economy at this stage. The slash and burn, fast track deficit reduction that has been adopted basically involves the government in saying, `Hang the consequences of all this for growth, hang the consequences for employment. Leave that to labour market deregulation, leave that to the IR legislation. That will solve that particular problem for us.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government now has the IR legislation that it says it wanted, and it will become evident very quickly to the Australian public that any suggestion that it will make any difference to the employment situation is simply illusory. Here, as elsewhere, the electorate has been sold a very large and scraggy pup—by the `dog' on this particular occasion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ALP's budget strategy, the opposition's budget strategy, is very different indeed. We make no bones about stating with confidence what an alternative approach should be. We acknowledge the importance of reducing the deficit, and we want to contribute to a reduction in budget deficit, to improve national savings by that means as well as by actions in the private sector. But we say, and will continue to say, that this is not the highest
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         priority for the Australian economy at the moment. It should not be regarded as a priority which completely outstrips the much greater need at the moment, which is to do something sensible and serious about unemployment.

        Australia does not have the kind of deficit or public debt problem that afflicts most other industrialised countries in the world, particularly in Europe. We do not have to take drastic action because of runaway current account or inflation problems. We can afford to take a moderate and balanced approach which does not add to unemployment, which does not involve sacking public servants, taking half a percent off growth.

        The irony, as we continue to assert, is that you can do all those things by an approach which gets you there but without any of the pain that this government seems determined to perpetrate. There is a high cut road to balance; there is a low cut road to balance. You take the high cut road, we will take the low cut road, and we say that we can get there before you with a much more sane and humane balance being achieved in public expenditure and fiscal achievement as a result.

         —That was the wrong spokesman, wrong day, wrong analysis. It occurred to me that perhaps the reason the opposition had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) get up today to do the MPI is that it might be his last occasion here as a spokesman on economic matters. I cannot imagine
         <break page="8420" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          why they would have chosen the day when the labour force figures showed a 24,000 increase in jobs for the month to run an MPI on the stagnating economy. All I can think of is that earlier in the week they sat around and said, `Look, Gareth has had a bad year; we'd better give him the last debate of the year. What will we do it on? We will do it on stagnation.'

        The only trouble is that at 11.30 this morning this `stagnating economy' produced 24,400 jobs. I do not know if they told the shadow Treasurer that and he went ahead in ignorance, or whether they gave him the shortest straw and said, `We've got nothing else to do today; you'd better hop up there and run your line on the stagnating economy.' Perhaps the most prescient explanation is the one I give, and it will be very interesting to see whether the deputy leader is back here next year or whether he is still a spokesman on the economy.

        It has not been a happy entry into the House of Representatives for him. We understand that it is a different place from the Senate, but it would have been easier for him if his party had allowed him to actually run an economic position. Clearly, the Labor Party has been at sixes and sevens with itself on economic policy. I take that into account as one of the difficulties that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has faced.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Party started off by saying that there was no deficit. That was the first claim after the election: there was no deficit. Don't you remember? At that point, the deputy leader was sent in here to say that it was all a con, that it had been concocted. That was the first economic proposition that the Labor Party was putting: there was no deficit. If that were right, no deficit reduction strategy was required.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), had to maintain that line because he had been assuring everybody during the election that the accounts were balanced. Once the accounts were disclosed and released to us, we knew what he had every wit of knowing during the election campaign, that we were
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         facing up to a $8 billion deficit at that stage and a $8 billion deficit the year after.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the accounts finally came in, it had worsened. Far from this deficit having been engineered or somehow put into place by the government, the fact was the outcome was a $10 billion deficit. Do you not recall coming into this House after March—and I think I would ask my advisers, if I were you, for an explanation as to why they put this proposition up—saying that there was no deficit, it was all a con—in fact, there was nothing to be balanced? That was the position you were running on behalf of the Labor Party in the aftermath of the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Once the accounts were disclosed and the Labor Party could not maintain that myth any further, it then said, `We will agree to a deficit reduction strategy and we will agree to balancing the budget.' Your argument at that point, you may recall, was that, again, it would be too much to balance this deficit over two years; what should be done was a balance over three years. That was your argument in the run-up to the August budget; in fact, that was your argument the day after the budget.

        Then we had the Labor Party, in its pre- and post-August budget incantation, saying that what it would do differently is that it would balance the budget and it would balance it over three years. Of course, never having an eye for consistency or credibility in relation to policy, what that eventually meant was that it would balance the budget over three years by opposing all expenditure cuts, which meant either one of two things: it really had a tax agenda—since it is in opposition and did not move any taxes that could not have been its position—or it had no comprehension that to close a deficit you have to reduce spending.

        Where do you think all of these things flow from? Where do you think the reductions in interest rates flow from? Has it ever occurred to anybody in the Labor Party to ask this question: in late 1994, official interest rates went up 2¾ per cent—if it were so easy to reduce official interest rates, since you were going to an election in March 1996, why didn't you reduce them? If it were just a matter of doing nothing, why weren't the official interest rates reduced between late 1994 and March 1996? That is when the Labor Party knew it was going to an election. Obviously, home buyers and business would have benefited from interest rate reductions. Why didn't it occur? The reason was the Labor Party couldn't do two things, and these are the two policy responses that have enabled this situation to be set up: one was to lock low inflation and low inflation expectations in—and that was done by the statement of monetary policy and the position we are taking in relation to wages—and the second was to address the fiscal problem.

It was necessary to put that budget strategy into place in order to make fiscal policy consistent with monetary policy. The truth cannot be faced, because the truth of the matter is that dealing with fiscal policy and getting the benefit in relation to interest rates exposes where Labor really stand. They are against putting the fiscal accounts back into balance, which means they are in favour of higher interest rates.

The problem for our children—and I have two: young Benjamin, who is 13 and in the gallery today, and Clare, who is 11—is that, unlike the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday, they do not have the opportunity to write their own school report.

        That is the real question the Australian community ought to be posing at the moment. Has this government performed to its expectations, to the best of its ability, since it was elected on 2 March? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, when responding to the Prime Minister's own report card yesterday entitled `The 1996 progress report to the people', that it was big on rhetoric and little on achievement. If you have any doubts about that, the Australian community ought to objectively examine the performance of the Howard government today with respect to the all&amp;hyphen;important issue of unemployment. I know it is not of concern to the Treasurer, who is leaving the chamber at the moment, because he comes from a well&amp;hyphen;heeled section of the Australian community and he is capable, unlike many Australians, of purchasing his children's way, irrespective of their ability, into a university place.

        I take the view that all Australians are entitled to equal opportunities in life. That requires that in examining this government's performance—its report card—today we critically examine its performance on the question of jobs. I'll tell you what: it is a pretty miserable performance. The Treasurer suggested today that Australia ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, said yet again today that she is a friend of the trend—the 8.7 per cent rate.

        The Treasurer had the hide to come in here today and say that as we get closer to Christmas Australian families ought to be relaxed and secure in the knowledge that the trend rate of unemployment is 8.7 per cent. Do you know what that trend rate of unemployment 8.7 per cent means? It is not only the same trend rate as last month but also the worst trend rate of unemployment for 18 months.

         the ropes when it comes to achieving their very moderate budget objective of 8.5 per cent unemployment. Compare that to the target we were prepared to set at the start of this term of government. I think our target of five per cent was realisable. The government has set a moderate target of 8.25 per cent.

        When questioned today, the minister for employment was not prepared to commit herself to the capacity of this government to achieve the moderate unemployment rate of 8.25 per cent. I would have expected, with the establishment of that all&amp;hyphen;important unemployment committee, that the Howard government coming up to Christmas could have come up with a few new ideas about how to assist industry, to build confidence in the Australian community and to ensure that we can do something about making substantial progress to reduce unemployment in Australia.

Housing interest rates rose above 17 per cent. In fact, many small businesses were paying interest rates of around 23 per cent. Proof of that item on that report card can be seen, if you drive through many country towns like the ones in my electorate, in the number of vacant shops and the number of families who have lost their businesses—testimony to the very bad economic management of the former Labor government.

        Living standards is another item on their report card. Our world ranking, based on per capita income, fell from tenth to 22nd in the 10 years from 1983 to 1993. National savings were lower than at the depth of the 1982-83 recession. Household savings were at a record low level. Is it any wonder that they were at such a low level when, over the past decade, it has taken two family incomes just to meet mortgage payments and household expenditures and keep families together? It has been so tough for many families in my electorate that they have not even been able to afford to send their children on school camps.

        During the 1982-83 recession, investment fell to 22.6 per cent of GDP. It recovered slightly to 25.7 per cent and then plummeted to 20.5 per cent in Keating's recession of 1993. At the end of the Keating era, it had only risen to 21.7 per cent of GDP. As is the case with unemployment, the damage done was greater and the recovery has been so much weaker.

Those figures, while they are evidence of the failure of the previous Labor government, do not show the pain, the suffering, the pressure, the tension and stress felt by so many Australian families. Our current account was the worst in the OECD. For 13 years Labor fiddled around with the tax system, and every time they fiddled with that tax system they created an even greater

In the six years from July 1990, the beginning of Labor's recession, to March of this year, only 7,100 full-time jobs were created. Between July 1990 and November 1992, 433,000 full-time jobs had been destroyed. Once again, those figures do not show the pain and the suffering that those families and those who have lost their jobs have gone through.

        This bill implements the government's election commitment to provide rollover relief for the disposal of active assets used by small businesses. Rollover relief has been eagerly awaited by thousands of small business operators that potentially faced a capital gains tax bill when they sold an asset and sought to invest the capital in a new one. The capital gains tax acted as an impediment to small business growth and jobs in the small business sector.

         The genesis of this scheme lies in providing relief from excise on diesel fuel used `off road'. This link, which hypothecated excise for road funding, was terminated in 1959. The rebate scheme introduced in 1982 was more restrictive than the previous exemption scheme. Subsequent amendments mean that it is now highly focused on activities which contribute directly to the competitiveness of the mining and primary production sectors. It is no longer appropriate to consider the scheme in its historic context. Excise and customs duties raised on diesel fuel are general taxation measures.

          The amendments to the definitions, particularly beneficiation, make it clear that the physical act of mining or beneficiation is eligible for rebate.

          Several other recent decisions addressed what might essentially be categorised as transport activities. The only transport activities intended to be covered are the transport of minerals and ores for beneficiation at facilities remote from the place at which mining activity is carried out, and certain activities specifically provided for.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Amendments were made to the act in 1995 and 1996 to ensure that activities `connected with' mining were no longer eligible for rebate. The interpretation of the so&amp;hyphen;called `sweeper clauses' had been a source of contention over the years and generated most of the litigation under the scheme. These clauses were replaced with an objective list of activities that are eligible for rebate.

          In the decision of Dyno&amp;hyphen;Westfarmers the AAT found that driving explosive trucks over an average distance of 150 kilometres each way between the explosives depot and the mine sites was either `mining for minerals' or `the preparation of a site to enable mining for minerals to commence', as those long journeys were `an integral part of this activity'.

          <para first-indent="16">
           The government considers that it is wrong to apply the concept that an activity is eligible for rebate because it is integral to another eligible activity. It is the intent of the diesel fuel rebate scheme to pay rebate only on those activities that are explicitly mentioned in the legislation and not to activities that are said to be integral to, associated with or connected with these activities.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The amendments are necessary to put the intent of the scheme beyond doubt. The approach adopted by the AAT in the Dyno&amp;hyphen;Westfarmers case would defeat the purpose of the amendments made in 1995 which removed the `connected with' sweeper clauses.

          <para first-indent="16">
           Similarly the AAT and Federal Court have considered the question of transport of materials&amp;hyphen;inputs to mining operations and beneficiation in recent times. Rebate is intended to be paid for beneficiation of minerals and ores, including transport where such beneficiation occurs at a place removed from the actual place of mining operations. Rebate is not intended to be paid for the transport of goods&amp;hyphen;materials&amp;hyphen;inputs for mining operations or beneficiation.

           In the Westrail matter, the Federal Court found that transporting coal to a place of beneficiation by rail was part of beneficiation itself, because the transport was `integral' to having the bauxite beneficiated. This logic was comprehensively reviewed and rejected by the AAT in the Queensland Rail matter. The two decisions cannot stand together. This bill therefore amends the diesel fuel rebate scheme to ensure that only the transport of the minerals and ores to be actually beneficiated receives rebate.

           Under amendments made in 1993, a provision was inserted to restrict payment of rebate to fuel purchased within three years before the application was received. To ensure that claimants were not disadvantaged, this provision allowed for claimants to give notice prior to 1 July 1994 of an intention to make an application in relation to purchases back to 1986. The effect of that notice was to preserve a claimant's entitlement and not have it constrained by the three&amp;hyphen;year provision.

Those who lodged notices of intention have had over two years to lodge claims, and it is intended by the bill to only allow another six months for this to occur.

         With regard to cargo terminal operations, during the inquiry the committee inspected the cargo terminals at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Evidence suggested that competition should be encouraged in the cargo terminal operations sector to provide choice to airlines and forwarders, to encourage improvements in service and because competition has the potential to lower prices. The committee has recommended that the government and Federal Airports Corporation facilitate effective competition in the CTO sector and that the FAC should allow off&amp;hyphen;airport CTOs as long as Customs and AQIS standards are met.

         On the issue of freight capacity, the committee found Australian air freight rates for exports are some of the lowest in the world. They are sustained by passenger services and inbound freight rates. This has allowed low value products to continue to be exported.

         The amount of capacity available to exporters will be determined by the demand for passenger services and inbound freight.

         There needs to be a change in culture from those who are aspiring to the export market and the use of international air freight services. Air freight is the most expensive form of freight in the world. It is not something that can be developed on the basis that you can get a back&amp;hyphen;haul rate from imports, enjoy a cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy from imports across to exports, and then expect the capacity that is available to you to develop and expand based on the back&amp;hyphen;haul rate. When additional capacity has to be utilised, has to be brought in, it has to earn its keep. It has to bear the full cost of the placement on that route and in both directions. That is the message that really has not been understood by many people aspiring to the export market and to the use of air freight services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Paragraph 2.11 of the report makes the point that if producers of perishable products want to export successfully then they need to produce high value goods, and they need to produce goods that are delivered on time and that are of consistent quality. That message has to be developed. The market in which we are competing is a market in which there are many players, and many established players. We have Israel developing crops in Australia for export out of Australia. We have New Zealand, to our east, which has done much better than Australia.

        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the unexpected points that came out of the inquiry was that New Zealand is utilising Australian air freight capacity. New
         <break page="8435" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Zealand has developed a high quality product, a stronger market, better product identification, reliable delivery and consistent quality. For those who are interested, if they look to paragraph 3.55, table 2.1, of the report they will see that New Zealand can get a better rate out of Australia than they can from New Zealand. For instance, the rate to Hong Kong is $A2.78 per kilo ex&amp;hyphen;New Zealand. But ex&amp;hyphen;New Zealand via Sydney to Hong Kong is only $A2.06. Similarly, the rate to Tokyo is 16c per kilo cheaper exporting from New Zealand via Australia than it is exporting directly from New Zealand into Tokyo. It is the same with Singapore.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         New Zealanders are always hungrier, go harder and develop these more prestige quality markets and are utilising our freight capacity and getting a better and cheaper rate for it. That was a surprise to the chairman, to me and to all of us associated with the inquiry. As we work through that, we need to get the message across to those in the potential producer side of the industry that they need to go out and develop their market, develop a quality product and develop product identification.

This was a point made by Peter Pokorny, National Merchandise Manager Produce with Woolworths.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Producers need to go out and talk to their potential customers, identify the product they want, the quality they want, when they want it, what volumes they want and then go for it rather than saying, as we have in the past when there has been a bit of surplus production in Australia, `We'll see what we can do in respect of export.' New Zealand is the model. There are people in the industry who are very skilled at exploiting and developing that export market utilising air freight services. We need to follow through on what they are doing.

          Coming back to the costs that the chairman referred to, because there is a substantial and effective cross&amp;hyphen;subsidy from imports to ex ports utilising air freight, we need to recognise that the scale of capacity available and the frequency of capacity available is a function of existing passenger services and a few dedicated freight services. Where the passenger services are is where the capacity is. The capacity can be drawn to where it is needed if the exporters develop that premium product with proper identification, a product that is able to bear the additional rate that is needed to justify the provision of air freight service in and out.

         The thing that kept coming up all the time was that it was a case of exaggerated expectations, that it was always the transport costs that were the barrier rather than the exporter having sought out a market or selling a product that was able to bear the cost of the freight involved. The conclusion in 4.130 of the committee's report adequately deals with it, saying:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         . . . that the impediments to the export of perishable and time sensitive products do not lie primarily with the transport sector. While . . . some participants in the freight chain may be seeking to blame other participants for poor service, the committee considers it is more important to address the underlying reasons and to move forward—
        </para>
        <para>
         I believe there is considerable potential there to be exploited but the exporters have to go out, pick and identify their market, and go for that premium price and get it. As Vanessa Fanning from TNT said, `If you have got the product and you are able to pay for the service, the service will be made available.' I commend the report to the House.

I also commend the chairman of the committee, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) for his work in producing what is, as has been noted, a unanimous report to the House. I echo the words of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) that one of the things that emerges from this report is that, although there are some problems in the transport chain with respect to air freight of perishable produce from Australia, by and large the prob

         There is no one big problem in this area; there are significant small problems or medium&amp;hyphen;sized problems in various parts of the chain but there is no one big bang sort of problem that can be addressed. There are structural issues that are hard to get around, for example the fact that Australia is not in a hub position as a transport operator but is largely at the end of the line. There are some significant and important suggestions and recommendations in the report such as the proposals for more competition in the container terminal operator area and more assistance to exporters to develop greater skills in marketing and promotion for their products—particularly a greater export focus, which I think is clearly the major difference between New Zealand and Australia and is the area where we have to improve. Another important recommendation is to establish industry freight export groups, giving the capacity for a market driven and industry driven strategy which should improve our performance in this area.

         I would like to comment finally on the question of the feasibility of an inland freight airport, be it at Parkes, Narrandera, Wentworth or any one of a number of locations that have been suggested. As the chairman of the committee indicated, the recommendation from the committee is that the government should not make a decision to establish and fund such an airport without extensive further investigation of that proposition. The committee was of the view that such an airport would be unlikely to be viable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The great problem is that we cannot put the cart before the horse. The demand for freight services, in my view, is not at this stage sufficient for the establishment of such an airport and the expenditure of large sums of taxpayers' money to establish such an airport. The critical mass is not there at the moment. It could well be in the future; one would hope that that will be the case but certainly at the
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          moment it would be unlikely to be economically viable.

         It is important to emphasise, however, that we had only relatively limited evidence before us. We were not the feasibility study into these proposals and should not be considered as such. The finding of the committee on this issue should only really be considered as an indicative or interim finding. It is up to the government to give further consideration to this proposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As I indicated, my view—as was the unanimous view of the committee members—is that at this point it is unlikely to be viable. But it is something that Australia and the government should continue to keep in mind for the future as something that may become viable at some point. It is something that certainly requires further examination. I thank again the members of the secretariat and the chairman for their great contributions. I commend the report to the House.

The community development employment projects scheme is of enormous benefit to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout this country. It provides a form of employment where there are few or no alternative employment opportunities, and it delivers services to the communities themselves.

         Australian communities live with a variety of hazards, both natural and man-made. The hazards include those arising from technology, human fault and hostile action. Some major natural disasters, such as cyclones and bushfires, are seasonal and regional, but other types of hazards, particularly those made by man, are less predictable and could occur anywhere. As far as natural hazards are con cerned, I refer members to the giant hailstone storms that were experienced in the Hunter Valley yesterday.

        The State Emergency Service has two primary functions under the State Emergency Act 1987: firstly, to act as a combat agency for dealing with floods, including the establishment of flood warnings, and to coordinate the evacuation of affected communities; and, secondly, to act as a combat agency for damage control for storms and tempest and to coordinate the evacuation and welfare of affected communities.

        The Sydney western division comprises of 14 local headquarters ranging from Ashfield through to the Blue Mountains. Last month I had the honour of attending the annual end of year presentation day of the Blacktown State Emergency Service. As part of the proceedings on that day, the controller of the Blacktown service, Mr Gary Fry, gave a detailed report of the services over the preceding 12 months. Gary detailed numerous calls for assistance from distressed residents because of damage caused by gale force winds, lightning, flash flooding and motor vehicle accidents. Assistance was also given by the SES in relation to a number of chemical spills and also to various community organisations such as the Smith Family, school displays, fun runs and RSL marches.

        The most hectic period this service experienced commenced in the early hours of Saturday morning, 31 August when a vicious gale struck the Sydney metropolitan area causing damage totalling over $50 million. Over the next seven days, from 31 August to 6 September, the service responded to over 212 requests for assistance across almost

        To cap all this activity, the most important role carried out by the service was its involvement on three separate occasions in searches for lost children. I am pleased to advise that on each occasion the children were found safe and sound. You can gather from these brief remarks the valuable service provided by the Blacktown State Emergency Service.

        To achieve these results, the SES—like the Defence Force—has to devote an enormous amount of time to training and planning for any possible major disaster. There may be tendencies by some people to regard the SES volunteers as unskilled and amateurish, but this is far from the truth. SES members today are required to achieve a high level of skills to achieve their objectives and, as such, are highly trained, multiskilled, unpaid professionals. On this particular presentation day, Mr Barry Wademan, the unit rescue officer, received a national medal for 17 years of dedicated service to the SES. Other certificates were received by volunteers completing training from first aid, radio communication and map reading courses.

        The Blacktown unit is also responsible for a wide range of engineering and heavy duty four&amp;hyphen;wheel drive vehicles, flood boats and a communication van, and all require a high level of skill to maintain and operate. The Blacktown SES has a long history of service to the wider community and has assisted in such major disasters as the Granville train disaster in 1977.

         —In 1990 the World Summit for Children adopted the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and a plan of action for implementation in the 1990s. For the first time, the global community agreed, at the highest critical level, upon international goals to reduce rates of mortality and disease, malnutrition and illiteracy and to reach specific targets by the year 2000. As a result of the plan of action, UNICEF has a number of important achievements to its credit.

         A million fewer children under the age of five will die this year than in 1990, in spite of unprecedented population growth. Every year about 80 per cent of the world's children are immunised against the major childhood diseases before their first birthday. Polio is well on its way to eradication. Guinea worm, which afflicted millions in Africa and South Asia until five years ago, is now on the verge of elimination. In just five years, an additional 1&amp;half; billion people are now using iodised salt, striking a major blow against iodine deficiency disorders and preventing mental retardation in some 12 million infants every year. More people have access to safe drinking water. Some 50 million more children are now enrolled in primary school than in 1990. Oral rehydration treatment, which prevents or treats the dehydration caused by diarrhoeal disease—the major killer of children under the age of two—has now reached 60 per cent coverage.

         Today the Parliamentary Association of UNICEF was pleased to host the launch by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) of the 1997 `State of the world's children' report here at Parliament House. This report, which is published annually by UNICEF, is one of the world's most respected summaries on the progress made against major specific threats to the health, education and protection of children in the developing world.

         Children do a variety of work in widely divergent conditions. At one end is child labour, which is exploitative, life threatening and harmful to the child's development. Extreme forms of child labour include the slavery suffered by children in bonded labour and prostitution. At the other end many children are involved in work that may be beneficial, enhancing learning skills, self&amp;hyphen; esteem and a sense of responsibility, and which does not interfere with schooling, leisure or rest. The impact of child labour on

         Drawing largely on ILO data, the UNICEF report estimates some 250 million children aged five to 14 are involved in child labour in the developing world. This estimate is a sharp revision by ILO from its earlier estimate of 73 million child workers between 10 and 14 years. The majority of child labourers—153 million—live in Asia. It is estimated that 80 million children work in Africa and 17&amp;half; million in Latin America. Many child workers are hidden from view, particularly girls doing domestic work. Their numbers push the total even higher.

         As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today, this issue must be attacked from all sides. There must be increased awareness of the problem both nationally and internationally, enforcement of existing legislation, the adoption of international law, cooperation between national governments and their police forces, extension of voluntary labour programs, the existence of strong local women's groups and NGOs and, above all, increasing access to basic education.

         As an Australian legislator, I am proud that Australian governments, both present and previous, have taken an active approach in this region towards assisting countries of the region in working towards the elimination of child labour. As the `State of the world's children' report says, it is time morality prevailed. As we step into the next millennium, hazardous child labour must be left behind, consigned to history as completely as those other forms of slavery that it so closely resembles.

         —As Christmas approaches, I suggest to Australian families they have no cause to be relaxed and secure about the question of employment. If you have any doubts about that, you ought to really examine the job figures of today. That is not just my view. It is also the view of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, who, when questioned today, refused on a number of occasions to nominate a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        If Australians at large ought not to be relaxed and secure about their job prospects, it is women who ought to be most concerned. The participation rate for women has dropped more this month than the rate among men. This seems to reflect a very deliberate endeavour by the government to put in place policy parameters aimed at forcing women out of the work force. I dare suggest that they are deliberate strategies, such as changes to child&amp;hyphen;care costs. It is really about social engineering and political correctness in the mind of the government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ABS labour force figures suggest that employment growth today is stagnant. Until the ABS data shows a more positive trend in jobs and that we lock it in, Australians cannot be relaxed and secure about their job prospects. As the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs said today, she is a friend of the trend. She ought to be concerned—and I agree with her refusal to set a time frame for a possible fall in unemployment—because the trend rate of unemployment is locked in at 8.7 per cent, the worst trend rate for almost two years. That is nothing that the government should gloat about. I know why the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has his head down at the moment. He knows that the economic strategy of this government has created economic chaos out there and a lack of confidence in the performance of this government.

        Over recent months we have had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying, `When we fix industrial relations and we get our budget

         strategy through, all will be right on the jobs front.' Time and time again, the Prime Minister has said that to the House of Representatives. For example, on 12 September he said:
        </break>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reality is that unemployment in this country will not be turned around until the policies of the new government are allowed to operate. Those policies include the passage of the budget and the passage of the industrial relations legislation.
       </para>

        The problem for the Prime Minister is that he now has his industrial relations and economic agenda in place and all of a sudden, over the last couple of days, we have started to see the new excuse.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Treasurer (Mr Costello) ran out the new excuse earlier this week. He started to suggest that the participation rate is the cause of high unemployment in Australia. When you talk about the participation rate, it is really code for the fact that women now feel as though they have a right to participate on an equal basis in the Australian workplace. One of the real achievements of the last decade has been that women have really felt confident enough, because there was a government in place that supported their aspirations and desires, to actually go out into the workplace. If this government has a problem with the participation rate, all I can say is that we were prepared to cope with that problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the information of the House, if the participation rate were the same now as it was when John Howard was last the Treasurer, Australia's unemployment rate would be 3.3 per cent. So code for participation rate is opportunity being withdrawn from women. It is making it hard to get access to child care and is saying to women that, because of the increase in the cost of access to nursing homes, your job is now back to being a carer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         It is a 1950s concept. It is a concept embraced and supported by the Prime Minister. It is not about choice. It is about conscription back into the home. It is about the withdrawal of opportunities for women. When the Treasurer raises the participation rate it is code for saying to women, `You are no longer wel come in the Australian workplace. Your job is as a carer in the home. We do not regard you as equal participants in the Australian workplace. We are going to attack your industrial rights.'

         —I wish to bring to the attention of this House a matter which depicts the conflict between ordinary Australians and the bureaucratic structures which increasingly govern our lives. The matter raises questions of paternalism in regard to the treatment of aged and vulnerable people. The Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care, which lies just south of Waterfall within my electorate of Hughes, was initially built in 1907 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. The architecture and approaches to care depicted those of the 19th century and reflected a need to separate people with this affliction from main society.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Although the purposes for its use changed from tuberculosis to aged care in the 1960s, no significant capital works occurred over the years and neither have they occurred since. Within this system, a culture of paternalism, lack of privacy and overcrowding persisted until the last decade. In fact, the culture was more akin to that of a 19th century poorhouse than that of a modern aged care facility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why did different governments and state health bureaucracies allow this to persist? Perhaps it was because its residents were basically asset poor and suffered from conditions—such as frailty, dementia and chronic physical impairments mixed with increasing age—which made advocacy virtually impossible. Through these times the staff gave care of the highest order, but in conditions which prevented anything but the basic needs being satisfied.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        During the enlightened term of the previous Fahey and Greiner state governments, it appeared that a new era was dawning in this institution. Capital development plans were drawn up, a new village complex was proposed and advanced to the procurement phase and a commitment to the care of people with a dementing illness was strongly indicated.

        <para first-indent="16">
         With a change in the area health board and state government in New South Wales, all of these proposals were aborted and a downsizing process commenced. This process occurred under the guise of the Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state agreement in regard to state government nursing homes. It appears that the process was initiated with some secrecy and to those involved at the grassroots level the process has not been transparent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Let me document the facts. From an initial 280 bed nursing home complex associated with a 28 bed hostel, the centre has now been reduced to 250 beds. Under the new proposals, it will be reduced to 120 beds. The hostel will be phased out. One hundred of these beds are to be allocated to the Illawarra area which leaves the Sutherland shire, with its 200,000&amp;hyphen;plus population and a rapidly expanding aged sector, left in a deficit position with regard to the stringent Commonwealth nursing home ratio of 40 beds per 1,000 residents 70 years and over.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The situation will be even more devastating as the centre has developed programs for those persons who have severe challenging behaviours associated with dementia. The residents from this category have been accepted from both the Sutherland and the Illawarra areas because of the extenuating circumstances which preclude them from being placed in traditional nursing homes. There are 80 such persons in the Garrawarra Centre which gives some indication of the magnitude of the problem being discussed. The centre has also initiated nursing development units dealing especially with the palliation of long&amp;hyphen;term dementia sufferers once they are less mobile.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The changes being pursued in regard to this Commonwealth&amp;hyphen;state agreement have occurred in the absence of any resident, carer or consumer consultation. This is almost inconceivable in 1996. In fact, if this had occurred in the non-government or profit sector, the Commonwealth or state bureaucracies would have unleashed their wrath and power to prevent such actions being taken.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Compounding the situation is the fact that there is no guarantee that the money saved will be redirected into aged care or that
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          promised capital rebuilding for dementia care will actually be pursued. Given the track record of these matters, it might be predicted that the alternative will happen. Although the analogy is odious, the process being observed here is very similar to that which was experienced by the Scots in the clearances of the last century. This act allowed disempowered people being moved and relocated for economic ends without consultation or guarantees.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These people who are affected are among the most disadvantaged and powerless in our society. These are our elders. They deserve better and in this proposal they appear to have been betrayed by bureaucratic double speak. My concern is not that the conditions of accommodation and care at the Garrawarra Centre should be improved. It is that under these governmental agreements the specialised care given at Garrawarra will disappear altogether, that money saved will disappear into the abyss of state Treasury and the citizens of my electorate will be seriously disadvantaged by these processes.

There is a notice of motion relating to question time which seeks to limit the time for a question and the time for the answer. We have not even been permitted to have a debate on that. I would have thought that the notice of motion relating to gagging the debate on a dissent from the Speaker's ruling would have at least merited discussion in this place.

        There is the proposal—I have said that it is not mine—to have a staffing and appropriations committee.

It is well known that the overseas travel by the President and the Speaker, because they are in the Department of the House of Representatives, which is not scrutinised, can be buried. The staffing and appropriations committee would have far more functions than just dealing with that matter. I say to Speaker Halverson—I reproach his predecessors—that we really do need a staffing and appropriations committee, the need for which was no more evident than when we were hacking and slashing the committees.

        The point I want to make is this: it is no good talking about the higher standards required in the parliament and not living up to them, whether that refers to ministerial conduct—it is a matter of pity that the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, would not have hesitated; you would have seen more ministers go—or whether it refers to the issues that I have raised by way of notice of motion. I think it is a condemnation of the government and Mr Howard's advice of higher standards that not one of these notices has been debated or discussed in this parliament or in this House, picked up by the Leader of the House or, indeed, referred to the Procedure Committee.

         —I wish to bring to the attention of the House a matter of grave concern for the small business sector of Australia and the community at large. It concerns the harsh, unconscionable and deceptive conduct of a publicly listed company, Berklee Ltd, an exhaust component manufacturer from Ballarat Victoria.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Early in 1988 Mr Sid O'Toole, now a constituent in the Capricornia electorate, decided to investigate the possibility of going into small business. During a meeting with the national marketing manager of Berklee Retail, Mr O'Toole was told the Rockhampton store, which he was contemplating buying, was the most successful in Australia and that it was one of a few yet to be converted to their franchise. The marketing manager also told Mr O'Toole that there were 120 franchised stores Australia-wide and that not one of them had ever gone bankrupt. In addition to this, he told Mr O'Toole that 50 per cent of the royalty payments made by the franchisees would be spent on advertising, promotion and marketing, demographic surveys, store assistance and staff training. It all sounded good so Mr O'Toole made the commitment and purchased the store and its assets to operate as a Berklee franchise.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1989, in support of what management was saying verbally, Berklee Retail issued a
        <break page="8447" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         booklet on their franchise system titled `The Berklee way—making money'. This booklet stated that over 100 Berklee Australia exhaust centres operated across the nation. The booklet went on to say what franchising involved and how it operated. Then, in March 1990, the company issued a company video which stated they had 120 franchised outlets across Australia. Both the booklet and the video promoted the same information management was telling Mr O'Toole to convince him to take the Rockhampton business. As it turned out, the company had only 25 franchised stores at the time and failed to meet any of the commitments and promises they had made. These were all blatant untruths.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is now evident that Berklee Retail, under the auspices Berklee Ltd, deceived and induced people through its management and its promotional literature to become franchisees on the pretext that they were experienced franchisors; that there were more franchisees than were actually operating; and, that big profits were there for the taking.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As honourable members would be aware, section 52 of the Trade Practices Act precludes misleading and deceptive conduct. The misrepresentations made by Berklee to its dozens of franchisees and potential franchisees clearly breach this section. There were a number of other promises Berklee made that can be proved to be misleading and deceptive conduct and a breach of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. Berklee promised franchisees the exclusive right to distribute Berklee products. This only lasted about 18 months before they removed their embossed name off their product from 1 July 1989, and began to flood independent stores—not, I might add, with a different product but with the same product. This action alone destroyed their own franchise operation completely and took with it almost every one of the 40 franchise operators and their investment.

        Further breaches of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act are as follows.

There was no back-up and support for these franchisees,

        I move this motion so as to ensure that the House can proceed with the business before it today and so that we can conclude matters in a timely and orderly manner. Members may not know this but today we are celebrating, so I am reliably informed, the 21st parliamentary birthday of the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the member for Ryan ((Mr Moore). I know I speak on behalf of all members—including, I am sure, those on the opposite side—when we congratulate them on their wonderful parliamentary contribution in the last 21 years.

        This also allows me to say that probably in the last 21 years neither member has ever seen an opposition as feral as the opposition that today occupies the other side of the House. There are a number of examples of this but, just as one example, members would be interested to know what has just transpired in the last hour and a half, which has been entirely at the instigation of the other side. In fact, it is normal practice for an opposition on the last day of a sitting—and today is, technically, an extended sitting from yesterday—

You responded in the traditional way, and that was the end of the matter. So it was, as I am sure members would be interested to know, that at the conclusion of that first attempt to suspend standing orders I had my usual discussion with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). I must be a mug. I confess that I am a slow learner, because I believed him. I must be mad. I said to him, `Do you think this will be the last of the suspensions today?

         Literally, by the time we had finished the divisions and I had sat down, he had the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) moving yet another suspension, simply as a tactic to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          disrupt the order and proceedings of the House. This sort of feral behaviour, unfortunately, is typical of this opposition that cannot accept the result of the election on 2 March. To me they their trivia is slightly exasperating, but it is typical of the way they operated.

        <para first-indent="16">
         On Tuesday, for example, we had a motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the United Nations and anti-discrimination and the like. We had an agreement—5, 5 and 5 minutes for the three speakers on each side. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) went for 15 minutes. At the ten&amp;hyphen;minute mark, I said, `We had an agreement. Why don't you keep the agreement?' He said, `Oh, there was no agreement.' The fact of the matter is that there was an agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So the next day we got another motion up. This time it was on a statement by the Prime Minister discussing the wonderful achievements of the coalition government since 2 March. So we had an agreement that the Leader of the Opposition would speak for no longer than the time provided to the Prime Minister—a perfectly reasonable, fair arrangement. I said, `Look, I was a mug for agreeing yesterday to a time arrangement with you, but please don't breach the agreement again the next day.' What happens? They breach the agreement the next day. I have an understanding about how we will manage business today. What does the Manager of Opposition Business do? He tears the agreement up before the hour is over.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fact is that, if you look at the way in which the divisions were conducted this morning, the normal arrangement is that a person moves the suspension, and we move that the member be not further heard. The seconder then stands to speak to the motion, and we move that the member be not further heard. Then the person in the chair states the motion and, usually, the motion is then put.

        <para first-indent="16">
         These people are so feral that, first of all, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay)—who prides himself on his understanding of the standing orders—just to delay the tactic, at his sort of lowest best, requires under the standing orders for the question to be actually stated. This is another little tactic. Then, just to delay people even further, instead of going
         <break page="8458" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          straight to the division, which would have been the third division—and they know they are going to lose all three, so why have three in the first place?—they simply present the Manager of Opposition Business so that we have to have another put motion. That means four divisions, which wastes even more time.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The House Procedure Committee has examined the matter of divisions. We are discussing it with the opposition parties. Contained within that report is an interesting evaluation and analysis of the number of divisions that we have had this year since 2 March. These people, as a result of their feral disruptive tactics, have doubled the average number of divisions for the House. That achieves absolutely nothing. It has forced us to sit longer than is necessary. It imposes additional costs for absolutely no possible imaginable reason whatsoever. I just hope that in the new year, after they have had themselves a holiday and a bit of a break, there is some return to semblance of order.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For example—to show you how they have absolutely no understanding of what is going on—their only policy, dictated by the member for Watson, is to have a division on absolutely everything. I said to them, `If the member for Jagajaga wants to have her say, we'll have two speakers a side on the 399 motion, but on the basis that we don't waste time with a whole lot more divisions.' What did they do? As soon as the next division opportunity came up, they called a division. When I said, `The deal is off,' they said, `We seek leave to call off the division so we can have the deal that you have just offered us.' We gave you the opportunity. We could not have been more reasonable. As soon as we are reasonable, you deliberately throw it back in our face because this is part of your tactics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) is a new member. I am sure she is a half&amp;hyphen;reasonable person. She has tried to weigh up in her mind whether or not what I say is reasonable and has any glimmer of truth in it. Before she is entirely lost to the wily, cunning and seductive persuasion of the member for Watson, there might be a glimmer of appreciation on her part that, if these people had any idea what they were doing at any point in
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          time, she could have picked up that offer I made. That is why, when that division was called—just so that it is quite clear with you people—we dealt with you fairly and firmly. But do not think we are going to give you an inch, because if we give you an inch you take a mile. Our experience of dealing with you is that as soon as we try to deal with you reasonably we get exactly that sort of reaction.

         All jokes aside, it is just absolutely ridiculous. We have no choice. I was not going to move in respect of standing order 399. You know I was not going to move it; I said it to you. As far as standing order 399 is concerned, let me put on the record that of course this is standard procedure.

          —`Jackboots' is the interjection from the short-memoried member for Watson. For example, on 19 August 1993 the then member for Swan and Leader of the House, the now Leader of the Opposition, in fact moved this motion. As governments are wont to do, he blamed the previous government for setting the precedent. I am glad the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is here because Mr Beazley, the then Leader of the House, said:
         </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This standing order was not invented by the Australian Labor Party. I think it was invented by the right honourable member for New England . . . It was certainly utilised first by the former member for Hume, Mr Fife, who is no longer in this place. It represents a reaction by the executive to a situation which, from its point of view, means that the business, if it is to be effectively transacted, has to be capable of being transacted without interruption.
        </para>
        <para>
         He went on to say:

        <para font-size="-=2">
         This is a country that has to legislate.
        </para>
        <para>
         That is actually a rather bold statement, given that reform fatigue and paralysis had totally set in at that point in time under the previous government. He said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         We have to legislate because we have a constitution which is not necessarily based on higher principle—
        </para>
        <para>
         this is a classic statement, actually—

         </break>
        </para>
        <para>
         If someone is as articulate as that, they deserve to be the Leader of the Opposition! That was the precedent in 1993. I will go back a bit further. On 19 December 1991 the then Leader of the House, now opposition leader, said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         This will help facilitate the business of the House for the rest of the day and ensure that what is an extremely tight program is gone through. This is the first time since we have been in office that we have moved this motion; as a precedent, we have the shining example of the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), who I believe was the last Minister to move this motion, no doubt for similar reasons . . .
        </para>
        <para>
         So it is with good precedent that we move the motion. In the debate then ensuing, the then opposition said that they appreciated it had been done in the past but that particular circumstances on that occasion should have been used to distinguish those circumstances in 1991 from the time that Mr Fife had moved the motion. In particular, in December 1991 the reason he thought it was inappropriate to move that motion was that the Labor Party was in the process of losing its Prime Minister on that very day and he felt it appropriate that the opposition should be able to move a motion for the suspension of standing orders—a not unreasonable argument, given the circumstances.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It also should be noted that these are two occasions on which the motion has been used or the standing order has been suspended. You will also note in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Hansard
         </emphasis>
         that on a number of occasions notice has been given so as to put the other side on warning that if they do unreasonably play up then that motion can be brought to bear. Of course, on a number of occasions Mr Beazley, in his capacity as the Leader of the House, did in fact give notice. I have records of notice being given on 6 May 1971, on 26 September 1979 and on a number of occasions through the 1990s—30 May 1991, 19 December 1991, 4 March 1992 and 19 August 1993.

          about the wasting of time. Let me just say this: had he allowed the motion that we were seeking to move to get the minister to come in and apologise to proceed, it would have taken 25 minutes. That is what is allowed under the standing orders. So the debate would have been finished no later than five to 11, or it could have been finished in two seconds if she had got up and said, `I apologise.'

        So let us have none of this about the wastage of time. Twenty-five minutes versus the fact that we now are into the second hour, heading into the third hour—and why? Because they want to defend the indefensible. They want to use every procedural trick in the book to prevent us getting to our feet to demonstrate where the minister has misled the House and getting her to apologise. A waste of time indeed!

        But this is not the first occasion on which we have had the Leader of the House wanting to stop the opposition moving things. We have had the situation with the euthanasia bill where, by the sham of moving it up into the Main Committee and preventing that debate occurring in the main chamber, it backfired on him eventually, because we ended up with a debate in the main chamber that took most of Monday. Had that been agreed to right from the beginning, it should have taken place in this place. It only happened because the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) moved a procedural motion that sought to put some sense back into the issues that we were debating, and we finally had a debate—but not because the Leader of the House would allow it. He did the best he could to keep it out.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But it does not stop there. The Leader of the House has for the first time gagged the appropriation bills in the detail stage, he has gagged the workplace relations bill in the detail stage—and do you know why? Their argument is that we have given sufficient time on the second reading. But the second reading speech, as everyone knows, is the generality of debate. What we have been saying and trying to point out time and time again is that, so far as this government is concerned, the devil is in the detail.

       <break page="8462" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The only way in which you get to the detail procedurally in this parliament is to allow debate on the detail—and that comes in the consideration in detail stage, it comes after the second reading. But time and time again we have had this government gag that very debate. The Telstra debate, the workplace relations debate, the budget bills—all of them have been gagged in the detail. And they say that they are in here lifting the standards of the place, making the parliament more accountable.
        </para>

         These were the words, the pious words, of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his first speech in this parliament after having been elected: `The one thing that we will do is lift the standards of the parliament to allow open debate, to allow accountability'—and they have debased them. They have prevented debate; they have cut the committee system; they have cut the resources to the committee system; they have had a procedural motion that went forever and that prevented the committees being set up in time.

         Again, the importance of the committees is to address the detail work of the parliament. But this is a government not interested in the detail.

         Let me just say that we are in this debate at the moment in this place because we sought to move a censure against the Minister for Family Services. Let us just go through the circumstances surrounding what those opposite are protecting in the actions of the Minister for Family Services. She came into this parliament yesterday and implied that the member for Jagajaga had been misleading people in the electorate about the impact of their measures in the budget, particularly as they related to child care. That was the assertion, and it was also the understanding that everyone who listened in this parliament got yesterday. Regardless of your attempt to go back and look at the detail of the words, there is a clear understanding of what was said.

         The trouble is that, when she used the line, she directly implicated the minister. When you got up in this place and after the interjection said that the member has put the decimal point in the wrong place, you misled.

        I am delighted to rise today to introduce this Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the accompanying bills, which give substance to a core commitment given by the government to the Australian people on 2 March. These bills reflect the government's faith in an Australian health care system which recognises both public and private providers and in which the private health sector actively complements the public services funded
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         largely through Medicare and grants to the states and territories under Medicare agreements.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The private health insurance incentive scheme, which this bill will implement, is the centrepiece of the government's strategy to assist Medicare from collapsing under the weight of demand for publicly funded hospital and medical services. The scheme does so by recognising the value of the private sector as an indispensable complement to the public sector and acknowledges that by making the fullest use of the sum of our hospital resources we will be able to ensure that Australians have reasonable access to the full range of public and private services.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The private health insurance incentives are not simply a commitment to private health insurance in their own right. Rather, they reflect that private health insurance is the way most favoured by Australians to gain access to the hospitals and doctors of their choice, when and where they need them. The scheme this bill implements is an essential part of restoring the necessary balance between the use of public and private health systems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This package of bills will give effect to the government's incentives to assist people to purchase private health insurance. They come not a moment too soon. It is a matter of record that, when our predecessors took office in March 1983, private health insurance covered 65.1 per cent of Australians. In June 1996, this coverage had fallen to just 33.6 per cent, with the burden of this exodus falling squarely on our public hospitals. Most particularly, the effect of the drop-out has been felt very heavily on public hospital waiting lists for elective procedures.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our predecessors chose to neglect the contribution private health insurance made to health financing, and deliberately allowed private health fund membership to slowly wither. It was seen as a boast by those responsible for our health care system that they personally disdain making any private provision for their health care. This government's election has ended that policy of neglect.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Medicare is a successful and popular part of this country's health system, the support of which is a key government commitment.
        <break page="8466" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Medicare, however, was never designed to stand alone. It was originally devised as Medibank by John Deeble and Richard Scotton in the context of being complemented by a robust private health care system, primarily funded through a private health insurance system partially assisted by government through measures such as the private hospital bed day subsidy and Commonwealth contributions to the private health insurance fund reinsurance pool. These supports were taken away by our predecessors.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result, the ongoing and increasingly precipitous decline in health fund membership threatens the financial stability of the entire health care system. The private health insurance incentive scheme, and the addition to the Medicare levy—to be known as the surcharge—for people on higher incomes who have chosen not to insure themselves privately, are essential measures designed to arrest the catastrophic decline in the level of participation in private health insurance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The available evidence suggests that the biggest concern Australians have about private health insurance is the cost of premiums. The government's private health insurance incentives scheme provides assistance to people who purchase private health insurance by giving them incentive payments to assist in lowering the cost of their insurance either directly through lowered premiums or indirectly through taxation rebates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The incentives provided will make private health insurance a more financially attractive option to ordinary Australians, especially in providing much needed assistance to the one-third of Australians already providing substantially for their own health care. For if we can, as a start, stop the exodus from private funds, health care providers—both public and private—can better plan for the future health care needs of our nation, and a time of likely increasing demand for health services, with confidence based on real stability.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will now outline the main elements of the incentives scheme. The government has honoured its commitment to provide private health insurance membership incentives for singles, couples, and families. From 1 July 1997, single people earning not more than
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         $35,000 a year may receive up to $125 each year towards the cost of their private health insurance premiums, and couples earning not more than $70,000 may receive up to $250.

        Eligible people will be able to choose the way in which they receive their incentive amount. They may either have the incentive paid directly to their health fund in return for a guaranteed reduction in premiums or they may receive the payment as a taxation rebate after the end of the financial year. This choice recognises that many Australians who have private health insurance are pensioners and self-funded retirees who no longer pay personal tax. Aged pensioners with appropriate health cover will clearly be eligible for the incentives. Health funds wishing to participate in the scheme will register with the Health Insurance Commission.

        The private health insurance incentives scheme will cost an estimated total of $8 million in 1996-97, $491 million in 1997-98, $609 million in 1998-99 and $616 million in 1999-2000. These estimates include both amounts paid to the funds in return for lower premiums being charged to eligible members and taxation rebates direct to claimants, as well as expected running costs. It is estimated that about 2.5 million memberships of health insurance funds, covering more than five million people, will potentially be eligible for these incentive payments. These costings are based on the assumption that the private health insurance participation rate will stabilise at just under a third of the population by 1 July 1997, and will then increase by two percentage points over time.

        This legislation will make private health insurance more affordable for the many Australians on lower and middle incomes. Those who have maintained private cover in the face of the premium rises largely driven by the previous government's policy will be rewarded for their perseverance. This is particularly so for those older Australians, many on very low fixed incomes, who have scrimped and saved against great odds to keep their cover. Those who have had to make the decision to let their membership go, and those who want to purchase health insurance for the first time, but have been unable to afford it, will also be able to benefit from the incentives.

        Another beneficiary will be the Australian health system. By providing this assistance, the government will restore $600 million a year of the funding that was deliberately and systematically cut out of the private health system when it removed bed day subsidies and payments to the reinsurance pool. It was on the basis of the private sector having this infrastructure that Medicare was introduced. These incentives will provide the injection of funds and public confidence into a private health system which for too long has been neglected, while our public hospitals are straining at the seams to cope with demand.

        The bill complements the private health insurance incentives being made available to lower income earners by providing encouragement to high income earners who can afford to take out private health insurance to do so. The bill provides for a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for individuals with taxable incomes greater than $50,000 or families with combined taxable incomes greater than $100,000 who do not have private patient hospital cover for themselves and all family members. Married and de facto couples and

        Trustees of trust estates who are assessed under section 98 of the assessment act—that is, a trustee who pays tax on behalf of a beneficiary who is under a legal disability—will also be liable for the surcharge if the beneficiary would have been liable. The required private patient hospital cover is cover under a private health insurance policy which provides benefits in relation to fees and charges for hospital treatment. This includes `front&amp;hyphen;end deductibles', or excess, cover. Cover merely for treatment provided by a medical professional in a hospital—ancillary cover—does not avoid the surcharge.

        The amendments imposing the surcharge will apply from 1 July 1997, in respect of the 1997&amp;hyphen;98 and subsequent years of income. This parallels the introduction of the private health insurance incentives scheme. The surcharge will generally be payable when income tax for a year is assessed and is payable. However, provision is to be made for PAYE taxpayers to provide for their liability for the additional amount through the tax instalment deduction system.

        The bill amends the proposed Income Tax Assessment Act 1996 to provide for a tax offset as an incentive for persons to take out or maintain private health insurance.

        The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to make changes in connection with the Medicare levy surcharge that applies to high income earners without private health insurance from 1997&amp;hyphen;98.

          —by leave—The report refers to one of the more exciting of all those areas of the Australian economy in our interrelationship with other countries. The services area is one which obviously has been expanding both domestically and in our export trade, and it is one which has become more notable as time and circumstance vary.

         The definition of services was a matter of some conflict. In the report we have referred to some of the alternative ways by which it

          can be identified. The ABS identifies services as:

         . . . everything other than goods, income and unrequited transfers—according to the international statistical standards. It is very much a residual category. We do not try to identify any services that might be bundled in with goods; they are covered in our merchandise trade statistics.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is the ABS definition that this report essentially relates to. The real problem we found, however, in preparing the report was the lack of information and the degree to which we found it hard to identify where and in what direction statistics were available to look at the whole array of service exports. The first four recommendations of the committee specifically identify what we see as a requirement. The report states:

         For example, relevant service statistics can be collected in the field of law, where there are many legal firms operating abroad; in the field of health, where we know that there are many health services provided; in the field of education and so on. To the degree to which each of the departments with specific areas of interest can provide data, it would be a great help in trying to identify not only what is happening but something of the future in that area.

         The rapidity of the growth in service exports is again apparent from tables that have been prepared. In spite of the lack of specific information and although I am about to quote from some of those, there is a problem because in so many areas the data is embedded in statistics for other factors. For example, in
         <break page="8471" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          major corporations, one cannot be sure when they are talking about trade in a particular commodity—for example, coal, iron ore or any of the other base metals—whether the service component has been included within that or whether they are separately identified. Certainly, in the figures available, we are relying on only the bald data so far as we are able to establish it.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         To give members an idea, according to the ABS, Australia's exports in services have risen from $5,836 million in 1984-85 to $20,373 million in 1994-95. So there has been an incredible increase in the volume of exports and that has more than offset the level of increase in imports. It means that service exports are at this stage contributing significantly to offset our balance of payments problem. In the report there are a good many other details, so far as we have been able to acquire them, looking at the data and identifying something of the measure to which services contribute to the whole field of the Australian trade pattern.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The report also looked at a range of countries. We decided that, in identifying Australian service exports, it would not be possible for us to deal with them in general, so we picked two economies: Hong Kong, which we saw as a fairly sophisticated and advanced economy, and Indonesia, which is a rapidly developing country. Even in the statistics which reflect both of those countries, again the increase in the value of Australia's service exports to them has been quite remarkable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are, inevitably, problems in competition. In trying to identify these service exports, we have looked at some of the impediments as well as some of the advantages. Chapter 3, for example, looks at the taxation element. There is little doubt that, when one looks at the complexity of the problems of tax, part of the problem still lies in the extent to which compliance costs do impose a burden on those involved in export.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Our fifth recommendation picks up some of the problems that exporters have seen in terms of the compliance costs and recommends that the Australian Taxation Office should undertake a more comprehensive ongoing sampling of the views of individual businesses to
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          ensure its actions are based on an accurate and realistic understanding of business problems and requirements.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the difficulties has really been inadequate knowledge of international tax law. Again, in the information and evidence given, we felt that more needs to be done to ensure that there is a better understanding of the complexities of international tax law. We see this as one of the areas where, no doubt, there is need in the business and academic world to advance knowledge beyond that which is presently available. The committee believes that an understanding of all tax issues involved in the export of services is important in any analysis of that service trade contribution to the Australian economy. Of course, it is even more important for those who seek to become involved in the export of services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to other impediments, advantages and disadvantages, we have analysed everything from telecommunications to problems in transport and in visas. In that respect, the committee has drawn on the recommendations that have flowed from the most recent Philippine discussions where there has been a new type of business visa settled between the Philippines, Korea and Australia. They call it the APEC business travel card.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I think the APEC business travel card is a wonderful concept if we can develop that with other countries. Although this report relates to Hong Kong and to Indonesia, the business travel card, which is based on an agreement with Korea and the Philippines, is a very good way by which travel between these countries in this region can be facilitated in future.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I want to pay particular attention to that section of the report relating to evidence received from Mr Norman Fisher of Australian TAFE International. There is little doubt that there are wonderful opportunities not just at the tertiary level but also at the TAFE level for providing an educational input into countries in our region. We found, particularly in the Indonesia and Hong Kong areas, there is enormous potential and great opportunity for Australia.

          One of the difficulties in service exports is the extent to which finance is available. Quite a number of exporters mentioned the problems of finance. The report has dealt with that, identified some of the problems and made some recommendations. In all, the report has 32 recommendations. We have looked at both the general and the particular.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          As I remarked, the report does concentrate on both Hong Kong and Indonesia. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, I think we need to understand that, with the change in sovereignty in its passage to China as of 1 July 1997, the pattern of trade with Hong Kong may well change. We identified a number of factors that have given us a competitive advantage in the past: English language, close proximity, the same time zone, recognition of a good overall standard if not a world leader in quality and a safe destination.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          All those advantages for Australia in its trade with Hong Kong will remain after 1 July next year, but the problem is that it is possible that, with the introduction of Mandarin as the language of government, some of the English language advantage of the past may go. We have looked at some of the problems that there are for the future, identified them and made recommendations with respect to them.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We know that there has been quite a degree of discussion between the British government and the Chinese government on the basic law. The committee has made a number of observations of our hope that, in the changes after 1 July, Australia will maintain a high profile in ensuring that the principles of the joint declaration and the basic law are upheld in Hong Kong to enable trade and investment to continue with confidence. We see that as one of the question marks after 1 July if change is implemented.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          With Indonesia there are wonderful opportunities. Again, the data is in the report. We have made a number of recommendations regarding the opening of markets there. We have certainly recognised that there are a number of problems in the way in which the law and the identification of practices within Indonesia complicate dealing with that country. We have also set down in paragraph 6.66
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           on page 118 of the report a number of factors which we believe will contribute to the success of exporters in the Indonesian market. To those interested in trading with Indonesia, I would commend those points to them.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee concludes that, although Australia is a small player in the large and expanding Indonesian service market, there are certainly great opportunities in the Indonesian market for us. Entry into the market is difficult, and the raft of regulations and licences, costs and cultural and business nuances to be dealt with should not be underestimated. The impact of these regulatory restrictions can clearly be contrasted with those in Hong Kong. No evidence was presented to the committee to suggest the current activities of the Indonesian government, in revising and updating its regulatory framework, are leading to more formalised nor more restricted market access conditions. In fact, some businesses consider life is easier as the systems are developed to a higher level of sophistication.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I believe the report does contribute quite significantly to a better understanding of the wonderful opportunities there are for Australia's services exporters. It is a report which began in the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade under the chairmanship of Michael Duffy, and I would like to commend him on the work he undertook in the early days of the inquiry.

In the last few months, in spite of her commitment to other committees, Bev has made herself available to ensure that the report is available for members of the House and for others so that it can be a reference point.

          —by leave—The seventh report is the result of a reference from the Senate in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 and, in particular, issues raised by the minority report, which I believe was mostly put together by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). The minority report does dissent in some ways from the recommendations of the committee in that it argues that the alterations to the amendments could in some way be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act 1993. The committee looked fairly closely at the argument put forward in the minority report. The committee has had some advice from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department as to their readings of how the amendments might affect the Racial Discrimination Act 1993.

         I know that, in the minority report, the member for Banks and other members are arguing a point but I, as a simple layman, think the point possibly is a little pedantic. It is probably a political position for them.

         I think that the sixth report certainly identified that the act is not working as well as it should be. The act is not clear in some instances. I think that needs to be addressed for the sake of both sides—the Aboriginal people and also those who might have other interests in the land that is under claim. It certainly needs to be addressed quickly so that tensions do not build up. I think there are indications at the present time that that could be occurring.

         I believe that this issue has been carefully canvassed. The seventh report that has now been tabled looks very closely at the argument put forward by the minority report. It certainly addresses the points that have been made clear by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this House. He has said on several occasions that, when he puts forward the amendments to the Native Title Act, he has no intention to in any way transgress the Racial Discrimination Act. He has also made it very clear that he would ensure that the integrity of the Mabo act remained.

         Having looking closely at this, the committee agrees that the amendments are in fact the wishes of the parliament and, as such, do not transgress the Racial Discrimination Act.

           is now a pivotal matter in the parliament's consideration of the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. It is unfortunate that history will record the race debate as having been one of the more significant aspects of Australian politics in 1996. For Australians of conscience and goodwill, however, the race debate will have confirmed the necessity to respect the varying rights enjoyed across the nation. This is not just an admirable principle; it is a moral imperative.

         Indigenous Australians who are native title holders enjoy common law status for those rights and, potentially, statutory recognition under the Native Title Act.

         The first minority report has led the committee to examine the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act through the prism of the Racial Discrimination Act. The second minority report, tabled today, dissents from the majority view taken on this question.

         The right to negotiate is a common law native title right. To this point it has been protected under the right to negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act. However, by virtue of the government's amendment proposals, that right is now under significant threat. In certain circumstances it will be lost altogether for some native title holders; for many others it will be grossly impaired. The impairment of these rights would amount to racial discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act because the rights are possessed only by a particular racial group.

This can be done by the government agreeing to the recommendation to insert a clause in the Native Title Amendment Bill providing for the Racial Discrimination Act to take precedence over the amendment bill. That clause would simply honour the government's election commitment and commitments that the Prime Minister has made to this parliament and to a number of forums which I will read out. In the current climate, we believe it is important for this clause to be inserted into the Native Title Act.

         However, to amend the act in such a way as to subvert rather than clarify and expedite its original intention would be both unjust and foolish. Any move that will see claimants lose faith in the processes contained in the act and revert to a myriad of expensive, lengthy and sometimes conflicting civil actions serves the best interests of nobody—not the native title claimants, not the miners, not the pastoralists and certainly not the majority of the people of Australia.

         The old legal dictum that justice delayed is justice denied is entirely applicable to this act. All interested parties are best served by delivering swifter certainty, but it must be a certainty based on justice and equity. Without this, the Native Title Act will rapidly become irrelevant as parties to numerous actions swamp the courts for years to come and resource development grinds to a halt. I repeat: resource development will grind to a halt if native title claimants are forced to resort to their common law rights and to the civil courts.

         What we want to see is a workable Native Title Act. I repeat the commitment I have given at the outset. I know that when the Prime Minister answered the first question that I put to him in this House on 6 May, he
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          called for the Democrats and the Labor Party to support amendments. I am sure that we can work our way through this maze. But 161 pages of amendments to a 127&amp;hyphen;page act does not lead, on its present analysis, to a more workable Native Title Act. It is coming down very heavily against indigenous people and taking away existing rights that indigenous people have won within the courts and have been given in the act. This government says it wants indigenous people to be economically independent; it has a new approach to indigenous affairs. Well, you cannot have that philosophy and then bring in these amendments to this act, a number of which are basically taking away from indigenous people gains that they have received in recent Federal Court and High Court decisions.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I look forward to sitting down with all the stakeholders in a constructive fashion, not in a political partisan way, so that we can hold the government to their promise. The devil is in the detail. It is one thing to go out and give the rhetoric; it is another thing when you look at the details of these amendments. We do not want a dispute between lawyers. That does not give certainty to the mineral industry, to the pastoralists or to indigenous people. We do not want this to be a lawyers' picnic.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I commend the report to the parliament. I think it is part of that process of consultation that the government undertook to involve itself in. But consultation is more than just talking to indigenous people. You cannot say it is consultation if you go and talk to them and you do not listen and do not respond to their genuine concerns.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The parliamentary delegation which visited Poland and Hungary in September and October 1996 was led by the President of the Senate, Senator Margaret Reid. I had the privilege to be the deputy leader of that delegation. Other members of the delegation included Mr Neil Andrew, the member for Wakefield in this chamber, Senator Alan Ferguson, a senator from South Australia, and Senator Michael Forshaw, a senator from New South Wales. So it is apparent that the delegation was well balanced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The delegation consisted of members from both chambers of parliament. It consisted of members from both the major parties within the parliament. The delegates represented two Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory. In addition, the composition of the delegation indicates clearly that it contained people with diverse interests who could, in a balanced and diverse way, contribute to the purposes and the objectives of the delegation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I pay special tribute to the President of the Senate, Senator Margaret Reid, for the great dignity and competence that she brought to her leadership of the delegation. My feelings were shared by the other delegates and by the people who accompanied us. We were proud to be led on that delegation by Madam President. The way in which she was received at all levels and in every place reflected great credit on her and also indicated the degree of appreciation of the people with whom we spoke in the places that we visited. This was the first official delegation that Senator Reid has led since becoming President of the Senate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I also sincerely congratulate the other members of the delegation, whom I have already identified by position and name. If the parliament needs confirmation of the commitment of members of parliament from all parties and from both chambers when they represent the interests of the parliament and of Australia overseas, let me assure them absolutely that that delegation showed such commitment.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The first priority of all delegates on all occasions was to serve the interests and objectives of the delegation, the parliament and Australia. They carried out those responsibilities admirably. They were dedicated. It was obvious from the response of the people we met that they were also very impressed with the quality of the delegation and the way in which issues were raised.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also wish to record a very special thanks from the delegation as a whole to the delegation secretary, Evelyn Kearns, and the senior adviser to the President, Mr Fred Peppinck, both of whom accompanied the delegation. Their assistance was outstanding. In the case of the secretary, the arrangements that Evelyn Kearns made and that she ensured were in place contributed in a very major way to the successful conclusion of the delegation. Her assistance, and the assistance of Mr Peppinck, in the drafting of the report which I have now presented to the parliament were also of very great value.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The extent to which and the way in which the delegation was received, and the importance which was placed on the delegation in Hungary, Poland and Potsdam in Germany, is indicated by the level of people who were able to meet with the delegation. For example, we met at some length with the following people: the President of Poland, the Prime Minister of Poland and the President of Hungary.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We met with members of the parliaments in those countries, with ministers and bureaucrats, and with leaders of the private sectors in each of those areas, as well as with officers in our overseas posts and private citizens. The hospitality and the courtesies that were extended to us as representatives of the Australian parliament were simply outstanding.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I also make a special reference to the spouses who accompanied the delegation. In particular, I mention Tom Reid, the husband of Madam President. This was the first time I had had a chance to get to know Tom Reid well, and I am pleased I did. He is a great fellow, and the other spouses who accompanied the delegation were great company and outstandingly supportive. While the spouses probably had a greater opportunity than the
         <break page="8477" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          delegates to look at the areas of Poland, Hungary and Germany that we had the privilege of visiting, their first commitment—absolutely, on all occasions, everywhere—was to the delegation and to the purposes of the delegation. I thank each of them, and I thank them collectively for the level of their commitment.

         The delegation to Poland and Hungary took place within the context of Australia's need to refine the development of the relationships between Australia and those countries in the wake of the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the old Soviet bloc. Poland and Hungary, as major countries within the old Soviet bloc, have only had about six years in which to undertake what to them has been quite a remarkable transition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I do not want to overemphasise the ease or the facility with which that transition has taken place. For example, the fact that recently Lech Walesa, who was the leader of the revolution in Poland and became its first president, was defeated by the young Aleksander Kwasniewski, who had been a member of the previous Communist Party government, indicates that there is a great deal of concern about some of the traumas associated with the nature of that transition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was no attempt on their part to conceal from us some of the difficulties involved. For example, in answer to a specific question which was asked frequently, they said that the main difference between the material and living circumstances of the people of Central Europe in 1986 compared with 1996 is that they are worse off. There is unemployment. Living standards have fallen. There have been shortages. There have been difficulties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are problems as a result of the breakdown in the traditional, historic, recognised discipline associated with centrally planned economies. As the discipline and social cohesion associated with those types of circumstances have gradually broken down, there has been an increase in serious crime and street crime. They are matters of importance to those countries because they are a result of the transition through which they have gone.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Many people would be of the opinion that a different model could have been adopted for the transition, but it is now a matter of historic reality that the model which those countries adopted was a model of their choosing. The problems associated with it are among the problems which they now face.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The development of Australia's continuing relations with those countries will depend upon the extent to which and the way in which we can develop our trading relations and the way in which Australia can find investment opportunities in those countries as those countries look for investment. It is not just a matter of Australia, for example, taking an interest in those countries in an exploitative way. They are seeking investment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The process of privatisation, in Hungary, for example, has been more on the basis of finding private sector buyers for existing industries. In Poland it has been more on a voucher type basis for the sharing and disbursement of public sector enterprises. In Hungary, for example, 30 Australian firms are now involved in joint ventures, with a total investment value of something in excess of $A400 million. So important opportunities exist. Both countries were very pleased with the extent to which Australia had shown an interest in developing investment in those countries, but they were disappointed that we had not yet been able to develop our trading relations to the same extent.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          One simple example which was developed by members of the delegation who have rural backgrounds, rural interests, was the recognition of the opposed weather and seasonal patterns between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Surely, that would lend itself to some type of integration as far as our rural industries are concerned. It would ensure a continuing supply, both to them and to us, of many of those products throughout the whole of the year. I understand that consideration is being given to those types of issues.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The fact that they are now moving very strongly towards market based economies has necessitated an interest in the possibility of developing investment. They are concerned about growth, about some of the obvious
          <break page="8478" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           inadequacies and problems that have arisen in the process of that transition. But, overall, there is a very clear determination on the part of those countries to pursue and to secure a much closer integration with the West.

         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          To a very large extent, that is historical. Both Hungary and Poland are members of the OECD. They are two of the more recent member countries to join the OECD. They are now looking towards membership of the European Union, the EU—originally known as the Common Market—and they are also seeking membership of NATO. They are looking to the West for their economies and their future defence arrangements—their security arrangements.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          By the turn of the century or shortly afterwards they will become members of the European Union. That means that they must necessarily at this stage take the opportunity to adjust their economies so that they are more in accord with the economies of the European Union. By doing that, when the time comes for them to join the EU the transition will be simple. They will just move in in a legal sense rather than seek to adjust their economies to move in in an integrated economic sense. They are in the process of doing that now.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not want to take up too much time but there are a couple of things that I do want to mention in relation to those two countries. Everyone knows that the position which they occupy in Central Europe has placed them in a sense at the crossroads of many of the great historic traumas that have taken place in European history. For example, as a result of the agreements that were reached after World War I, Hungary finished up with only about 30 per cent of its previous territory. The old Austro-Hungarian Empire had been a political, military and economic entity in Europe of enormous importance. Today's Hungary has a population of about 10 million and Poland has a population of about 40 million.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          However, the determination of the people of those countries to retain their identity and to forge their way into the future is inspiring. For example, when I saw Old Warsaw rebuilt, I realised the amount of destruction which had been wrought on Warsaw by the Nazi war
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           machine during World War II. I had no idea of the extent of the devastation. When the people of Warsaw were under siege, Nazi Germany urged them to capitulate but they refused to do so. Nazi Germany then said they would destroy the city. In effect, the people of Warsaw had said, `Do your darnedest'—and the Nazi war machine did destroy the city.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The people of Warsaw, the Polish people, said, `We will rebuild Old Warsaw as it was'—out of the rubble that they salvaged from its destruction. Old Warsaw stands there today—what a remarkable monument to the courage, the sacrifice, the determination and the pride of those people—as a symbol of the finest elements of the human spirit.

          In Hungary, we had the great pleasure and privilege of visiting the Hungarian parliament. It was designed to be completed in 1896, which was the 1,000th anniversary of Hungary as a nation. We were there at a time when they were celebrating their 1,100th anniversary at that magnificent parliament house in Hungary, on the shores of the Danube. This is a beautiful parliament house and a parliament house that Australia is proud of, as it should be, because it is ours. I have always said to people that the Australian Parliament House is the best parliament house in the world. But in terms of the adornment and the sheer beauty of a parliament house, that parliament house in Budapest must be without equal.

        In the last few decades, Asian migration added substantially to the economic development of our major cities. This is not the first time that we have had waves of Asian migration to Australia. In the gold rush era of the 1800s, especially in Victoria, some 20 per cent of the Victorian population was made up of Chinese people. That was unplanned, out&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;control migration of course, and a lot of those people did not intend to stay for generations in the country. The repercussions of the head&amp;hyphen;on competition for limited resources in the young colonies—colonies that lacked the social and physical infrastructure to cope with those waves—produced rampant racism and ethnic prejudice. The legacy of that era—our intolerance of other races—influenced our migration policy into the next century and, in fact, for over 100 years. References to our old White Australia policy are still wheeled out to shame us in the region every now and then.

        There can be no doubt that migration intakes must be carefully paced and planned to match the state of the economy. We need to give each new wave of immigrants the optimal chance to find work, accommodation, language skills and the comfort and security that they seek in their new home. If we have no ability to forward plan and deliver an agreed number of visas, for example, then we are not protecting the interests of the latest wave of newcomers who are always the most vulnerable to population pressures and competition for resources. It is the most recently arrived who experience the pressures.

There are

In the USA, there is a belief that any citizen can, by their own efforts, work their way up from the log cabin to the White House. But in Australia, on the other hand, we believe that the cabin dweller is as good as the President in the White House any day. You can only sustain our particular brand of egalitarianism if most Australians have a genuine egalitarian experience.

        To assist the government to forward plan for the infrastructure and the human resources needed to help settle our new Australians we need to give all of our newcomers access to all that is good in Australia.

        Under Labor, the immigration program did not give the minister those sorts of controls.

In 1995&amp;hyphen;96, the family stream had come to represent almost 70 per cent of the immigration program, a growth of 27 per cent. The spouse category had grown by 32 per cent and the number of parents by 74 per cent. This blow&amp;hyphen;out occurred because, under the present legislation, the preferential family category is exempt from the quota maximums placed on other categories announced for each annual Australian migration program.

         The previous government could not prevent a visa being granted to a person who applied for it on the grounds that he or she was a spouse, dependent child or aged parent of an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident of Australia. This bill allows the minister to determine the number of people to come in under the family schemes and, where the numbers are exceeded in any one year, to hold those applications over so they can head up the queues for the next year. This means that we can deliver a planned, orderly, bal anced, paced and equitable migration program.

        The measures contained within the bill are also necessary if we are to efficiently manage the migration program. We must aim to increase the cost recovery and simplify the administration. There is no excuse for heavy&amp;hyphen;handed bureaucracy and time wasting paper shuffling in the public sector. There are currently three different fees collected under three different pieces of legislation which require not only a visa fee but a health services charge and an English education charge if the applicant does not have functional English. This bill introduces a global visa application fee that will be set at a level which tries to recover the costs associated with these service deliveries. While the visa application fee will be set, the regulations allow for exemptions and concessions for certain categories of people—for example, those coming in under humanitarian and preferential family categories. So, as is always the way with our Liberal ideals, we have a safety net for those who cannot pay.

         These amendments also implement a legislative exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period in respect of applicants who apply offshore for migration on the basis of a de facto or interdependency relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident. Married couples will not have to meet this requirement. The reason for this piece of legislation is that there is great concern among the wider Australian community that those who apply to come to Australia under the family categories do have legitimate long&amp;hyphen;term relationships. For exam ple, we have quite a bit of evidence where de facto relationships, cited as the reason for a couple coming together in Australia, break down even during the visa process period. These de facto relationships are twice as likely as marriages to break down very soon after the arrivals take place. The government considers that a two&amp;hyphen;year period of living together is not too much to expect of a couple to demonstrate a relationship which is likely to continue. We are asking for evidence of a two&amp;hyphen;year relationship before the visa is granted.

        This particular amendment is aimed at helping to reduce abuses which threaten the integrity of the migration program.

When they wait legitimately to be reunited with their marriage partners or long&amp;hyphen;term de facto partners, they will not experience the sneers and jeers of people suggesting that they are simply trying to rort the system. This particular amendment will stop people from taking places in the migration program which might otherwise have been granted to people who do satisfy the criteria for other visa classes.

         —Today we are debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996, the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. In the course of several days—dare I say weeks now—of debate on this particular package of legislation we have tended to allow debate to run fairly wide and to canvass a number of issues concerning Australia's broad migration program and policies associated with immigration. I would similarly like to make some comments about that, but before I do so I again would like to indicate to the House where the opposition stands in respect of these three bills and some of the reasons for opposing some of the initiatives which are contained within them.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no doubt that anyone reasonably expects that any government should have the right, and indeed has the responsibility, to establish appropriate targets in terms of levels of immigration into their own country and they should do so armed with appropriate knowledge. They should do so based on previous patterns of immigration to Australia; they should do so on the basis of compassion and they certainly should do so on the basis of economic need in the country. This particular piece of legislation, in terms of the principal bill, tries to roll together a number of charges which will apply now to individuals that wish to migrate to Australia. They are, in fact, looking to roll together the migration health service charge, the English education charge and the visa application fee into the one all&amp;hyphen;embracing charge. The opposition has already indicated that we will oppose the increase in the English education charge but we will certainly not oppose the other elements that are rolled into this area.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The interesting thing is that, in the budget, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) announced that there should be a two-stage increase to the charge. He said that the first would come into effect on 1 October, taking the charge from $2,205
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to $4,405, and this was to be done by amendments to the migration regulations. I am sure honourable members will recall that the opposition, with the support of the minor parties and the Independents in the Senate, succeeded in disallowing that particular regulation amendment. The second stage was to take the charge to $5,500 per person and this required legislative amendment. That is why this bill is before the House.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is unfortunate the government continues to choose not to separate the English education charge element of the bill so that we could do what we have indicated we would like to do, and that is to oppose just that element. The manner in which this bill has been drafted unfortunately makes that approach impossible. Also, it is fair to say that we on this side of the House believe that we would be inconsistent and not true to policies which we have always believed in not to proceed with opposing this particular part, because it would obviously supersede what was done in the Senate in respect of the disallowance motion. The issue really is the need for these sorts of charges. The issue goes to this government's philosophical belief in user pays and recouping costs, indeed with a slight margin on those costs, of any applications whether they be for visas, learning English or whatever.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The broader concept associated with the English language element of this particular part of the bill goes to a need to give full recognition to why newly arrived migrants, many of them from non-English speaking backgrounds, need to be assured that their ability to learn English or at least to get a working knowledge of English will not be impeded in any way. This has been an element which has been raised on a number of occasions. Indeed, I well remember in government writing to successive ministers for immigration about the work of the adult migrant education service in Wollongong and stating to ministers, on behalf of that organisation and various community groups in the Illawarra, that the number of hours of English language training made available to people who met the requirements, once they had migrated to this country, was believed to be
        <break page="8484" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         not an appropriate level; they thought it was a number of hours which did not get them to a working knowledge of English.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There were always approaches being made to try to remedy that situation. I am afraid one of the great failures of our government was that we were never able, certainly those of us that were making representations to relevant ministers, to change that attitude. The bureaucrats always had the view that 510 hours was all you needed and that, if you came to Australia from a country of a non-English speaking background, 510 hours would fix you up and you would be right to take your place in the work force and live a normal life in Australia. Obviously at the time it had an impact on budgetary considerations, just as will rolling into one charge this particular amendment to the bill. But I am not sure necessarily whether, as in this case, economics should always drive some of the policy prescriptions of governments—I do not care whether it involves those that presently occupy the treasury bench or indeed us when in government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second element of the legislation goes to repealing section 87 of the Migration Act 1958 to enable the minister, among other things, to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted each year. We on this side have already indicated that we will oppose the capping of these visas, because we believe it is not an immigration issue per se. We believe that this particular measure violates the right of every Australian—whether such an Australian has been a citizen for a day or six generations—to marry the person of their choosing, to be with their dependent children and to meet the responsibility of caring for their aged parents.

        A little bit of history often comes back to bite people. In June 1989, amendments were moved and agreed to by the then minister to make it absolutely plain that no interpretation could be construed that these same visas could be capped under the Migration Act. Interestingly at the time—1 June 1989—the now minister for immigration, in

I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.

         I was interested in some of the arguments being put by the honourable member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in her contribution with regard to this. She was talking from a family party perspective—from the perspective of the Liberal and National parties, who trumpeted themselves during the last election campaign as being a family friendly party. This was going to be the party that was going to right the wrongs that the dreadful Labor Party had done. If you were a good family person, you would be looked after. The only trouble is that, if you happen to be a family person living in Australia but your spouse is overseas, this particular element of the legislative proposal is going to mean that you may not necessarily get your spouse, or your dependent children or your aged parents into Australia straightaway. The member for Murray says, `They might have to wait an extra few months.'

        <para first-indent="16">
         What if the situation were reversed? I have often asked this of people in my electorate in the Illawarra—and if there is one area of Australia where you have such a diverse ethnic background of people, it is the Illawarra. The city of Wollongong has something like 86 different ethnic nationalities represented within it, and we are proud of that fact because they make a tremendous contribution to our local community in all sorts of ways. Many of them are leading business people. Many of them have contributed in a whole range of cultural activities. Many of them, through the festivals and other things that
         <break page="8485" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         But what we are seeing now is this family friendly party, the government, coming along and saying to these people, `If you happen to have a parent that is overseas or you happen to have children that are overseas or even your wife or husband is there, there is no guarantee for a period of time that they are going to be able to come into Australia.' As I say, put yourself in the reverse situation. If you were an Australian citizen who migrated to another country and the government of that country said, `You're going to have to wait until you bring your wife over or your kids over,' how would you respond to that? I do not think you would be too happy. I know I certainly would not be. I find it quite extraordinary that we get these sorts of comments coming back.

         There are two major elements to this legislative change, the first one being implementing the legislative exemption to the Migration Act 1958 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency—that is, same sex—relationships. We have already indicated, I believe, that we will be opposing this measure as it is singling out these categories for especially harsh treatment. We believe that stricter screening and a two&amp;hyphen;year provisional visa as would apply to spouse visas would be a proper check on the bona fides of these relationships.

         We have supported all the government's measures designed to tighten compliance. So I do not think anybody could rightly come into this place and say that the Labor opposition has in any way diminished the government's responsibility or has not given support to the government in tightening up measures in terms of compliance. But we are concerned that this measure does seem to be somewhat discriminatory, and we would like to see the government treat it in a different way.

It is rather interesting—I know many speakers in this debate have commented on this—that, if you trace the history of immigration into this country, you see a distinct set of waves of people coming from particular geographic areas, and that has often been based on policies of the government of the day. Of course, much has been said about the White Australia policy and the restrictions that applied there.

         If one takes the opportunity to look at some of the statistics available on sources of immigration, one can see very readily how that has changed. For example, in a publication by the Department of the Parliamentary Library entitled

         a table on page 4 headed `Settler arrivals: Top 10 source countries of birth, 1965&amp;hyphen;66 to 1995-96' clearly shows changes that have occurred. For example, back in 1965&amp;hyphen;66 the major contributor to levels of immigration to this country were people from the UK and Ireland, running at about 51.9 per cent. Greece contributed 10.5 per cent; Italy, 7.9 per cent; Yugoslavia, 5.6 per cent, and so it goes on. Coming as I do from Wollongong, it was interesting to find
         <break page="8486" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          that out because that is exactly right. People were actively recruiting people in southern Europe to come to Wollongong to work in the steelworks. They offered houses, jobs and all the rest of it to people from villages, and these people are still making a tremendous contribution in the Illawarra.

        <para first-indent="16">
         When we go through the table, we find that in 1975-76 certain people start moving up the table. The UK and Ireland were still at the top, but they had dropped to 32.9 per cent. People from Chile, Lebanon and Malaysia were coming to Australia. In 1985-86 the UK contributed only 15.9 per cent of the migrants coming to this country. We see that Vietnamese, Filipinos, mainland Chinese and people from South Africa, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Malaysia and India were starting to make an impact. In 1995-96 we find that the UK had slipped into second position on the table, with its contribution down to 11.4 per cent, and New Zealand was in front. Then we had a variety of contributors from China, Hong Kong, India, Vietnam, the former Yugoslavia, the Philippines, South Africa and Iraq. This demonstrates again that this is because world circumstances change, we have taken in a lot more refugees and so on.

We're being overrun by people from the north; we're being overrun by Asian hordes.

         —She has left the building? Quite possibly so, as usual. I would like to contribute to this debate on the migration legislation today in recognition of the many migrants who live in my electorate, particularly people from Asian nations who have come to Australia by choice. They have come here to live and invest to ensure their children have a better future than the one they had. This is a very basic tenet of so many of the different Asian cultures and the Chinese culture: to work hard and provide a better future for your children is a worthy aim. Hand in hand with this very basic tenet goes a great respect for the contributions which their parents made for their own wellbeing. So there is a very wonderful inter&amp;hyphen;generational support mechanism which I think, without any worry about the generalisation, typifies so many people who have a Chinese heritage.

        I think this happened with the Greeks and the Italians after World War II, after the great southern European migration commenced to this country.

        I submit, until recent months, all people in my area have lived quite happily together. There has been no question, no discussion about ethnic background. Racial intolerance had been buried sufficiently beneath the surface to ensure we have had good conduct in my local area. As I have told this House before, in recent months we have seen people spat upon and told to go home. I do not want to embellish those comments any more because I do not want a headline about it tomorrow. I would like these good people in my area and others across the country to settle down and have a good Christmas, working in harmony, as they once did.

        But some in my area also point to the signs which exist in shopping centres around the Sunnybank area. Part of these bills deals with matters relating to English language skills. I think it is worth pointing out to those who are critical of seeing Chinese writing displayed so publicly in parts of my electorate to remember it is basic marketing. If you run a restaurant, if you run the ANZ Bank or the National Australia Bank or the Westpac Bank or the Commonwealth Bank or any of the other banks which are in the area, you are naturally going to put Chinese script there to explain to customers in more familiar terms what they need to know about what they are doing in the building and how they can invest their funds.

         my community, like Peter Low and the Cathay Club, who work very hard to ensure English is taught.

        One of the great satisfactions to come out of this whole messy debate is it will settle down, matters will be better for the next generation, which is, in itself, satisfying to members of my local Chinese community. They are prepared to struggle to make sure their kids are in a better situation and education comes their way. Hand in hand with all of this is the fact migrants coming to this country from another nation accept it is our sovereign right to make changes to our policies as a nation to address, in a finetuning sense, matters which come to light and other matters which need addressing.

        So, for all of those reasons, I am pleased to speak in support of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is the principal bill in a package of three bills to improve and simplify our current legislation regarding immigration and multicultural affairs. The two other bills are the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996 and the Immigration (Education) Charge Amendment Bill 1996. Through all of these bills, the government proposes to improve and simplify current legislation by amending the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991, the Immigration (Education) Charge Act 1992, the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 and to merge the health service charge and the English education charge into one visa application fee. This makes it a much more streamlined approach. The incorporated fee will be administered through the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996, which is expected to be proclaimed next year.

        This government will also introduce greater flexibility into setting the upper limits of migrants to Australia under the different categories of the current migration program. This will be done by amending the Migration Act 1958 by repealing section 87. It will provide a better balance. I submit family
        <break page="8489" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         reunion matters have been abused by some, although I do not know of any instance in my electorate. This bill will do something to ensure there is a bit of balance brought back into the system as far as family reunion is concerned.

        The ability to cap various components of the bill will mean a fair and sustainable level of immigration can be set to suit the prevailing conditions from year to year. This will include implementing the legislative exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to enable the minister to set a two-year cohabitation period for intending offshore migrants who are in a defacto or interdependency relationship with an Australian citizen or lawful permanent resident.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We will also see in section 21 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 a lifting of standards expected by Australia of its migrants, and the Migration Act 1958 will be amended to enable the minister to withdraw Australian citizenship from anyone who has fraudulently obtained it. As the member for Cunningham said, I do not believe anybody in this place would dispute this part of the bill.

        As we all know, circumstances change. We live in a dynamic world and a sector of the world which a lot of people want to come to. It is important we are able to make changes to our migration program when they are needed and not be locked into formulas and quotas, which were a hallmark of the previous government's policies and other governments before it. Whatever our migration policy evolves into over the years, it is most important we get the very best people the world has to offer. It is no good restricting people from one part of the world or enhancing people from another. As a country—other countries respect this viewpoint—we have a right and an obligation to ensure the very best of people migrate to Australia.

         —I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 and related bills. I guess the nature of my electorate, which has the sixth greatest concentration of non-English speaking people in the entire country, with 34.2 per cent in my electorate born in non-English speaking countries, does mean that I have a particular interest in these policy areas.

        I do not want to dwell at length on the comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) over a broad expanse of race issues, but she did make a contribution to this particular debate and I think some of those points should be taken up. She made a simplistic comment about ghettos and the concentration of people. One would think that is something new. In actual fact, my own electorate has been characterised by this concentration for over a century.
       </para>

        My predecessor's parliamentary secretary, Val James, once commented to me that when she went to the Granville South public school in fifth grade, that was the first time she had spoken English because she mixed amongst such a tremendous group of Welsh people that they did not speak English at home. Similarly, if you look at the history of my region, the fact that soccer was such a strong sport is clearly related to the presence in the late 19th century of large concentrations of Scottish mechanics and people of other metal trades.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Lidcombe is characterised by the presence of the Kaparty Ukranian Credit Union, by the Ukranian Catholic Church, by the Ukranian nuns, by the Ukranian Club and by the Ukranian Women's Hall. Once again, this is not novel. This is a fact of life. To start saying that somehow people are going to immediately abandon the possibility of living with people from the same homeland is just so naive that it is beyond belief.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, the fact that Ukranians are prevalent in certain parts of my electorate relates very clearly to the presence at Maryland after the Second World War of a migrant hostel. Similarly, in Berala in my electorate there are concentrations of Croatians and Filipinos, which is clearly related, again, to the presence
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         of the Catholic Church there and the fact that there was a degree of catering for those communities by the church.

        This thing about ghettos and people living in ethnic islands is nothing new. It has been a characteristic of this country. It is a characteristic of New York and many European countries these days. To believe that somehow it is just going to disappear tomorrow morning and we are going to be able to shift people out at gunpoint to live at Rockdale or some other suburb is just preposterous.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Secondly, the member for Oxley made a simplistic comment about overseas aid; that we should get rid of overseas aid. If the member for Oxley really wanted to do something about migration pressures on this country and the refugee problem, she would know that the one thing we have to do is make sure that the foreign aid of this country, which is only 0.3 per cent of GDP—that is, three&amp;hyphen;tenths of one per cent—is concentrated in areas that have clear gains for people rather than for authoritarian governments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are certainly a number of categories in which aid can make a major contribution towards the unparalleled movement of people internationally—famines, forced relocations through warfare, et cetera. Foreign aid is crucial to stopping that. At the end of the day, if you analyse it, you see that it can make a major contribution to making sure that Australia is not pressured on refugee intake and is not pressured with regard to people who for economic reasons want to come to this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Anyone who knows anything about foreign aid knows about the clear connection between women's education and decreasing population growth. If the member for Oxley—rather than sloganising and knowing the electorate does not like foreign aid and thinks it is a bad thing, et cetera—really wanted to do something about the pressures we do face in regards to population push and migration she would make sure that this country had a sizeable foreign aid program and it was directed to areas like population control, the education of women, and improving health and living standards in those countries. We all know that internationally western birth rates
        <break page="8493" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         have declined in Japan and Europe, for example, because of the upsurge of those economies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, we have another simplistic notion from her that everyone should leave their problems behind. They should get off the boat and forget they come from Serbia, forget they come from Croatia. They should blithely go on, forgetting their relations who might have been shot dead the previous week in some pogrom in the former Yugoslavia. Once again, that is totally unrealistic. I would pose the view that it would not have been a major contribution to the history of the world if Polish and French refugees fleeing Nazi occupation went to the United Kingdom and said, `Let's forget about what is happening in Poland. Let's forget about what is happening in France.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Quite clearly, to have this kind of view that people can forget about the need for freedom in the country they come from, forget about the fact they came to this country because they would obtain certain rights they did not possess, forget about genocide, pogroms, racial discrimination and somehow merrily go to mass every week and believe that solved the world's problems is simplistic in the extreme. What we have here is a series of very simplistic propositions.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        She then went on to say that we should deport everyone who was born overseas and had committed crimes in this country. Quite frankly, regardless of whether people are born here or their parents have been here 40 years or they gained citizenship five years ago, there is no real difference. These people have the same rights as those who have been here for generations. So to believe for one moment that deporting two people of Chinese extraction because they are involved in the heroin trade is going to do anything whatsoever to overcome a problem where big money is involved, where there is always that option for people regardless of their background, once again is not facing up to problems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, in her contribution the member for Oxley spoke about New Zealand. The point that she makes, that a significant number of people who come into New Zealand under the target migration program are compelled to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         speak English and have to return money if they fail, is accurate. But I think we should, once again, look at this issue on a broader front. She is throwing up to us that New Zealand has the solutions. Quite frankly, if you have a look at migration policy in that country, one would find a number of areas of the concern for the people of this country.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the most blatant areas of concern in recent years—and this has been pushed by our own tourist industry for commercial purposes—is the move by New Zealand to become visa free on a selective basis for a number of countries. One of the things Australia has had for many years is a regime of visas to basically decrease the possibility of illegal overstay and to give the government some control over the people coming here.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        New Zealand, this glorious example that is held up to us, has selectively abolished visas. In the long term that creates some pressure on our country. Similarly, anyone who has followed refugee policy in this country or had any interest in it would know that one of the push factors that we had, particularly after the Rabuka coup in Fiji, was the reality that people were easily winning through the New Zealand refugee intake and thereby a few years later coming here after gaining New Zealand citizenship.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other very clear difference between the two countries is that New Zealand is not a great magnet for permanent migration. It is not an attractive destination for most overseas people. The clear difference between the countries when we start comparing them is the nature of the political population. Australia does have currently a high proportion of people born in non-English speaking countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Whether the member for Oxley likes it or not, in any democratic system they are going to have some say in the process, they are going to have some impact on what kind of migration policy we have. New Zealand does not have that reality. It is very difficult to see a sustained argument as to why this should be the be&amp;hyphen;all and end&amp;hyphen;all for us. In summary, as I say, the contribution of the member was a basic collection of slogans, a collection of appeals to the populist, a collection of broad
        <break page="8493" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         comments that have very little to do with this bill and to do with migration in general.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In speaking to this bill, I do want to canvass the wider issues of migration. I do that, as I say, because my electorate is characterised by a very high proportion of people from non-English speaking backgrounds. I have to say that one of the worst outcomes of the comments of the member for Oxley is that there is great difficulty now in having a legitimate debate about migration and population policy in this country. Unfortunately, on the one side, there has been an element of political opportunism, catering for those elements in the electorate who do have these biases and, on the other side of the fence, there has been an inability to face up to the need for a total review of a number of the rules and regulations.

       Firstly, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to pass on those thanks and good wishes to the Speaker. The Speaker is always celebrated on election by moving to that chair flanked by two of his friends. The original speakers, of course, went into the chair flanked by three or four of their enemies. It is from those times that the tradition extends and, as a factor in that, many speakers did not serve out their full terms. Indeed, they found themselves incarcerated in the Tower of London. Life has got a bit easier for speakers since then, but not much. It is a tough job to do and we thank you for it.

You should know this: there is a rule in the American navy that no warships may be named after living sailors. It must be a real indication of the distinction of your service that at least part of the war&amp;hyphen;fighting activity that goes on over at Foreign Affairs has your name planted on the top of it. As a person who contributes in the policy area, Gareth is absolutely unsurpassed and his leadership qualities in this nation are well known.

       The British tradition of whips is of a person deeply engaged in the political process, not just in a numbers exercise. One of the reasons why we now have chief whips on both sides of the House, which is more in the British tradition, is because of Leo's diligent advocacy against a notable opponent—that is, the previous Prime Minister!—for elevation to that status. But it was the correct position to assume. Grateful for it are your able assistants, Rod and Ted, who also do a terrific job in keeping our end of the Main Committee going, apart from all the other work here, which is a very important thing for them to do.

       The right honourable member for New England did point out to me that leaders of the opposition spend a fair amount of time in the east. That is absolutely correct. What I had not realised when I took this job is that the Labor Party in Western Australia is a weekday party; all its meetings are held on weekdays. In the eastern states it is a weekend party. This has certainly made a difference to my weekends. It is an interesting phenomenon that there should be such a cultural difference in the way in which the weekend is treated. There is therefore a requirement upon my staff in Western Australia probably greater than it has been for a while.

        This provision means that the 20 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket health expenses will not be payable to those who have expenses not less than $1,500. The safety net had been set at $1,000. It is those disabled and chronically ill Australians who most frequently apply for the rebate on their out-of-pocket health expenses.

        It is those chronically ill and disabled Australians who most often have to face the gap payment between what many doctors charge and the official rebate. It is not surprising that their out-of-pocket expenses might exceed $1,000. Now when they exceed $1,000 but do not get beyond $1,500, the Treasurer and the Howard government do not have them eligible for their 20 per cent rebate. This is a government that can find half a million dollars to upgrade Kirribilli House for the convenience of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).

Why the double standard? Why is the political language so different for miners in Western Australia compared to newly arrived migrants? I would have thought the House could understand the point I am making and the House would accept the conclusion I have drawn—that it is about the various buttons that are placed on the keyboard of the government and its political morality.

I am sure that you, amongst others in this place, support what the Labor Party pursued in relation to cooperatives, and that was ensuring that they kept the tax deductibility that kept them in the game. It kept them in the game of value adding, it kept them in the game of the food market to Asia strategy that this government is so proud about and it kept them in the game of being able to expand.

        This is one of the greatest sell&amp;hyphen;outs in the history of the Country and National parties of Australia. It is not an exercise in competitive neutrality. The cooperatives do not distribute profits, so they cannot take advantage of franked dividends. These provisions have been in place for 60 years to make up for that competitive disadvantage. It is a section which levels the playing field. The Treasurer of course is now tilting it against the cooperatives—tilting it against the agricultural marketing cooperatives—and all in the name of foreign ownership. In so much of the Australian food industry there is already too much foreign ownership. The abolition of section 121C will make it very difficult indeed for those Australian owned cooperatives to survive.

        This is the slow death of the Australian cooperative movement, and it is not at all an exercise in competitive neutrality. The neutral thing to do in competition policy is to keep section 121C, the taxation benefits for cooperative companies, in recognition that they cannot take advantage of franked dividends on another part of the taxation ledger. So the Labor Party and the other parties in the Senate have supported competitive neutrality in the true sense and application of that principle and are pleased to support agrarian, small commodity capitalism.

       I reflected yesterday on the fact that we went through an election a few months ago and, without seeking in any way to make a political point about it, it represented the extraordinary phenomenon of democracy that we were able to peacefully transfer power from one side of politics to another through the ballot box after 13 years of one party being in power. We did it without a shot being fired in anger—we did it with plenty of verbal abuse but with a complete absence, as I am aware, of any kind of physical abuse. It is an extraordinary achievement, and we should never, ever take that extraordinary achievement for granted. All of us should work very hard.

There is a levelling quality about Australian politics that you do not find anywhere else in the world. It is still largely the case that political figures in this country can move freely, can talk directly to people and can be in receipt of very direct advice from those people, sometimes profiting from that advice.

It remains our responsibility, according to our views as to how it can best be achieved, to work very hard to see if that disadvantage can be taken away.

I guess it is a little bit late to go into that now, and certainly it has been well enough acknowledged elsewhere, but let me say for the record on this occasion that I—and know this view is certainly shared on our side of the parliament—believe he was the finest parliamentarian of his generation; a great reformer; a great achiever; a great Australian nationalist; and a great internationalist. We shall miss him and this country will miss him.

       John Langmore was, I think, a splendid parliamentarian in this chamber, in the committee process, particularly in his work as chairman and primary author—I know of a number of instances—of major reports, and in his work as a local member. He had a very
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The only disappointment, I guess, in John's political life was that he did not get to be a minister in either the Hawke or the Keating governments. There are all sorts of reasons for that. It is not really appropriate to speculate on them on this occasion, except to say that it had much more to do with the fortuitous dynamics of the political process than anything to do with his ability which is, was and remains immense.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       John Langmore was someone who did arouse very strong emotions because of the strength of his passion, his commitment and persistence with particular ideas. I can recall few emotions being expressed more strongly about him in fact than by our former Prime Minister and Treasurer on a number of  occasions around the halls of this parliament. I think it is interesting to speculate why that is so, John being such a thoroughly nice, decent Christian gentleman. Perhaps the reason was that he took less to heart the nostrum that the `blessed are the meek' than the nostrum that the `blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness'. John certainly hungered and thirsted after righteousness in the conduct of economic policy in particular and was, according to the biblical prescription, duly persecuted for his sins, I think, in that respect.

       It is certainly true that 1996 has been a year that could only be described as momentous. We have had a change of government, followed by rapid movement on many policy fronts. It is, I suppose, not all together surprising that that creates some dynamic tensions at times but, when all is said and done, I think it is a great credit to this parliament and to the way we do things in this country that we have in most cases enjoyed constructive, thoughtful and useful policy debate in the best traditions of a robust Western democracy.

       Among the goals for all of us in 1997 must be a desire to add constructively to good policy ideas and formulation, to help build harmony and goodwill in the Australian community and to help create a better life for this and for future generations of Australians. In the end, government is not simply about administration and about crossing the t's and dotting the i's. It is about more than that. It

       I put forward a plea to all this Christmas to take a responsible, caring attitude towards others, to remember that our Christmas tradition is built on the principle of goodwill towards everyone around us and to seek a reduction, not a rise, in the incidence of violence over the period. I believe that, as a society, we must be strong in applying penalties to those who wantonly engage in such violence. We have seen the release this week of a report into domestic violence, which only serves to underline the seriousness of the matter for us. Christmas, of course, is about more than that. I think it can offer an opportunity this year for us to reflect on how we build into a new millennium, particularly how we seek to make Australia into an even greater society enjoying a greater prominence in world affairs and enjoying greater opportunities in terms of trade opportunities, and those sorts of things.

        —I want to make a few comments of appreciation to those who have assisted my transition into not only this side of the House but the functions associated with it. Adjustment to opposition has not been easy but it is one of those things you have to cop. As I indicated before, just as much as we were able to adapt to this side, we can readily adapt back to the other side. Coming to grips with the new portfolio has been challenging and interesting to me, as indeed has been this

       My only exposure to parliament prior to this year had been on the executive of government and it always seemed parliament was endorsing that which the executive had determined. So to be thrust on this side of the House into learning about all those new standing orders and new forms has been quite exciting. We have found out about standing order 202 and standing order 100. I found out about 304A very early in the piece, Mr Speaker. I even found a way around 304A—that was 304—but that got me out for 24 hours instead of one hour.

       We have embarked on some interesting questioning of what we think goes on in this place. It is very interesting: the more you are involved in this place and the more you know what you heard from the other side, going back to the replays or the

For those who think there have been difficulties staying awake in this place at night, we can always go around to Sound and Vision, pick out the rough tackles when we are trying to get to the dispatch box, pick up the people who move seats after tellers have been appointed and pick up people who move after they have been seated. It means nothing to anyone else outside, but for those who live in this place it has a meaning.

       It brings me, in that context, to particularly thank you, Mr Speaker. I know that you have not found the task easy, although you are enormously proud of the position that the parliament has bestowed upon you. I joined with those at the time in congratulating you. I happen to believe that you are a very good Speaker because I think you have basic decency and commitment to the institution, which are the fundamental qualities that matter so far as a Speaker is concerned. You have an ability to fraternise outside the place and not be criticised for it. We have been to the football together, we tried to get to the cricket together and we have had a drink together—and he still throws me out! He is a totally committed Speaker. I enjoy your company and I thank you for the commitment

       To the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) I would like to extend my best wishes. He has had a good year—the only `A' rating and he is creeping up, and he loves it. We have developed something of a working relationship—I put the emphasis on `something' rather than on `working'. It is not exactly what you would call a close one. It is one that does involve some telephone conversations from time to time. They do not often produce much but they are enjoyable to have, particularly if you get them at the beginning of the day. You know, if he is ringing, that there is something up. It sharpens you up immediately. You have to be prepared.

       I turn to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), who is not here—I know he is on the way back from Singapore. I have a certain affinity with Tim because I inherited his office. When I arrived, he had left a can of Dark and Stormy, which is a combination of Bundaberg rum and Bundaberg ginger beer. I must say I have not drunk it yet. It is still sitting in the fridge—but not because I have not been prepared to try that regional product.

       I also inherited with the office the Fischer files. We had a lot of fun with those. Tim seemed to think that we should return them immediately. I claimed that they came with the territory. In any event, they are still waiting there to be collected. It took us a long time to photocopy all of them, and to return the original copy. Had the parliament been prepared to extend the additional staff, we might have been able to do it quicker.

We shared almost nine years together in the parliament, representing the ACT together. We worked very closely together. It would not be the world's best kept secret that John and I disagreed from time to time, but we were always able to cooperate on behalf of local constituents and local issues of importance—most recently, issues to do with the retention of the Canberra tax office and issues to do with the upsurge of racial intolerance in our community.

       The other thing which motivates me to speak about this today is the splendid irony, which will not be lost on John, that after 12 years of enthusiastic advocacy in the parliament for the National Museum of Australia, he was able, by precipitating a by-election, to convince people to spend money on things which he could never convince by the eloquence of his advocacy. He was a very effective advocate for that and met trenchant opposition from a large number of people.

I took great pride in the fact that, after one day's hearing on the child sex tourism bill, three ministers issued a press release attacking me and the committee because we were not apologists for the government. In a cross-party manner, we vigorously dissected that legislation and I think improved that legislation for the parliament—so much so that it has been used as a model by the New Zealand parliament and by other parliaments around the world.

It is a matter of public record that I did not vote for him on two occasions the leadership of the Labor Party was decided, but I have tremendous respect for him. He served this nation for 26 years in public office—as a backbencher, as a minister and ultimately as Prime Minister. He served with distinction. He is someone whom the people of Bankstown are very proud of. I was proud, honoured and privileged to be a member of his government. History will treat him well, and history will judge the 13 years of Labor government.

       This is my first opportunity to serve on the front bench of the Labor Party. I am the first member for Banks since the seat was created in 1949 to serve on the front bench.

I would like to draw the House's attention to some passing of history today. Many would know that behind the glass over there is a broadcasting box, but many would not know that behind the broadcasting box is an entire television production studio. After the House rises later this day for the final time this session, that television studio will be removed. That television studio, after all these years, is going down into the basement.

We thought we had panic on our hands, but editor and tape operator Ken Cathcart solved the problem. He said, `I can fix it,' and got from another tape three words from the Treasurer and put them on the current tape. To this day nobody has known that the vision and the sound were recorded at different times. So well done, Ken.

        —I take this opportunity to say a couple of things very briefly. This is the first occasion on which valedictories have been delivered since 2 March and the departure from this parliament of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. I appreciate the comments that were made by my good friend and colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in relation to Paul Keating. But I think it would be remiss on my part, at least, if I did not take the opportunity to say something about him.

       I believe, as Daryl Melham believes, that history will treat Paul Keating more than fairly and more than well. He was a person who left school, as we know, at the age of 14 and rose to the position of federal Treasurer and the national Prime Minister. He was a person who was always respected by those who related well to him and supported him; and those people who perhaps did not relate so well to him always recognised him as a man of very great vision and a man who had great ambitions for Australia. I believe it is a pity that Paul Keating was not given sufficient time to realise more of those great and profound objectives and visions that he had, and undoubtedly still has—visions that I believe he was very successful in conveying also to others and to Australia as a nation.

        I also want to congratulate the present Prime Minister (Mr Howard). If anyone deserved to become a Liberal Prime Minister in Australia, it was John Howard. I would emphasise to all of those members of the Liberal Party who are members of this parliament and to members of the Liberal Party in the wider community that John Howard has shown more loyalty to the Liberal Party than the Liberal Party on some occasions has shown to him. In the face of what on some occasions was quite shameful treatment, John Howard persisted in that loyalty. From that point of view, if the Liberal Party had to win—and of course I would prefer that you lost all the time—then John Howard deserved to be Prime Minister.

I know that Kim senior is just so enormously proud of Kim junior, as we all are. I thought that Kim Beazley's off&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;cuff response to Mr Howard's recent speech, the State of the Nation, or his report on the government's achievements over the last nine months since it came into office on 2 March, was outstanding—absolutely outstanding.

       The real thing I wanted to stand to do though was to say to John Howard `Congratulations'. It is a very heady feeling. Leo McLeay was talking about the class of 83. There are not too many in my class, Leo, and I know that over the course of the years it is remarkable the turnover of the chamber. For John Howard, the turnover has been both in the office of leader of his party and in the fluctuation from being in government to out of government, to being back into government. Indeed, with John Moore, there are only the three of us who, in fact, were in the Fraser ministry, which now seems a lifetime ago.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       But for John Howard it is a particularly significant occasion. He made a speech the other day which looked back on the achievements of this first nine months. Really, when you have a look at how this cycle of progress within this democracy of ours moves, it is remarkable how, in the hands of the people of Australia, there is a capacity to change the attitude, the perspective and, indeed, the fundamentals in such a dramatic way. I know that for John Howard it has been a tremendous year. I certainly wish him well and, as several have mentioned, it is wonderful that Jeanette is now well again and back to her normal state.

       It is also worth congratulating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on the elegance of the way in which he is performing. It is a hell of a position to be in. Being in opposition is bad; being Leader of the Opposition is worse. They tell me there is absolutely no worse position to hold than that of Leader of the Opposition of the Labor Party, and several of those who have held that office have explained it that way. I do not doubt that Bill Hayden, perhaps more than most, would feel that to be true.

Particularly when we come into government, we have a whole lot of policies we have prescribed, and it is hard to cut the budget at the same time as implement all those objectives to which many of us had committed ourselves when we stood for parliament.

It has been because of technology and changing patterns of demand within the marketplace.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        hypocritical indeed. The shadow spokesman for immigration has said that the government should not need to cap visa classes to deliver a balanced migration program. He argues that, after all, Labor achieved smaller migration programs in 1992&amp;hyphen;93 through to 1994&amp;hyphen;95 without using such measures.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Let us look at these claims. How did Labor achieve a smaller migration program in these years? A closer examination reveals that Labor achieved a smaller migration program by using two methods. The first was to dramatically reduce numbers in the skilled categories. The skilled categories went from a high of around 52,000 in 1989&amp;hyphen;90 to a low of just over 18,000 in 1993&amp;hyphen;94. In other words, Labor cut back on the very categories that deliver the greatest economic benefits to Australia. They cut back on the categories that are most needed to ensure that the migration program has the support and confidence of the community.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The second means by which Labor was able to achieve a lower migration program was as a result of driving the country into recession. Members will remember the recession that we had to have. It seems that we now know another reason why we had to have the deepest recession in 60 years. It was to enable the Keating Labor government to deliver a lower migration program.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This recession meant that demand for migration to Australia declined significantly. Increasing numbers of potential migrants simply did not want to come to Australia because of the state of our economy. Indeed, demand for migration to Australia declined so far that the previous Minister for Immigration took the extraordinary step of reducing entry standards to historically low levels just to generate additional demand.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As I have indicated on numerous occasions, the government is determined to deliver on our commitments to achieve a program that is clearly in the national interest. It will be a program with high standards of entry in the skilled categories and with high levels of integrity in the family categories.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I therefore would like to outline the new measures required to deliver a fair and balanced program. Research into the employment outcomes of migrants has consistently shown that an ability to use the English language is critical to success in the Australian labour market. It was for this reason that the coalition made a commitment in the election context to introduce points for English in the concessional family category where entry is based mainly on skill and employability factors.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This measure was designed to help address the higher levels of unemployment in this category compared to the independent category which already has points for English in its selection criteria. This measure also provided points for applicants with no English but proficiency in two or more other languages.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was in recognition of Australia's increasing international orientation and the fact that an ability to learn two languages demonstrates that these people would pick up English language skills quickly. The Labor Party has disallowed this sensible measure. This has meant that apart from the anomaly that the spouses of concessional family applicants will be able to obtain points for English—because Labor were clumsy in the drafting of their disallowance motion—I am left with no choice but to use the alternative, less flexible approach of expanding the existing list of occupations requiring English—the ORE list.

         This mechanism, which was originally introduced by Labor and has been in place for the concessional family category since 1992, is more difficult for some to satisfy than the points for English approach that the government favours. It requires applicants with an occupation on the list of occupations requiring English to demonstrate that they have vocational level English, irrespective of any other attributes they may have. This means, for example, that most young and skilled appli cants with no English but fluency in two or more other languages will no longer be successful.

        In 1995&amp;hyphen;96, around 23 per cent of applicants in the concessional family category had an occupation on the list that was in place at the time. However, occupations such as accountants, general managers and chemists are currently not on the list. It is, of course, absurd to suggest that employment in these occupations does not require English. I have therefore decided, based on consultations between my department and the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Industrial Relations, that this list should be expanded to cover these and a number of other occupations.

        The measures proposed by the government to introduce points for English language for the concessional family category would have applied to applications points assessed after 1 November 1996.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In introducing an extended list we want to try to avoid it impacting on people who had had their applications assessed prior to 1 November 1996 and hence have an expectation of success subject to meeting health and character requirements. To do this, I have decided to expand the ORE list to take effect for all visas decided from 1 July 1997. It is expected that most of the applications successfully assessed prior to 1 November will have been decided by then. It is estimated that around 85 per cent of applicants in the concessional family category are likely to have occupations on the expanded list.

        I want to assure the House that just as introduction of points for English would not have been contrary to the Race Discrimination Act, neither is an expanded list of occupations requiring English.

This is needed mainly to deal with the enormous pipeline of applications that the previous government had allowed to build up by holding pass marks at an unsustainably low level. It is also needed because in disallowing the regulations introducing points for English, the opposition omitted to disallow points for English for the spouses of concessional family applicants.

        The measures I announced in July have led to a reduction in applications, particularly in the spouse category.

While at this stage it is difficult to be precise in terms of the preferential family category, it is likely that capping will be required this program year for aged parent and possibly spouse applications. Obviously, it would be

        —by leave—The immigration statement of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) clearly reveals that both Labor and the coalition share the common view that we support lower immigration during periods of high unemployment. Labor, however, says that there is more than one way to skin a cat. The government of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has chosen to make families lose out. Labor won't.

       The Howard government's immigration program for 1996-97 actually plans for a big increase in the number of independent migrants.

This year we are expecting some 2,000 engineers to come through on an untargeted immigration program in the independent category.

       Before the last election the coalition said that "dependents of the family unit must receive priority over annual immigration intakes" and said that the coalition "does not consider that there should be any significant variation of the immigration intake at this time".

Keeping Australian families separated and bringing in, in preference, people with no ties to Australia to try to take their jobs is not the way to restore confidence in the program.

       I turn to some of the statements that are in the ministerial statement because they reveal a complete contrast between what the coalition said immediately preceding the last election and what they are now seeking to do. The Liberal and National Party coalition's immigration policy published on 9 February 1996 is my source document. In the minister's statement today he says:

       The coalition's policy document said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Immigration has varied considerably from its high levels in the late 80's to its lower levels in the early 90's. Given current circumstances, in particular continued unacceptably high levels of unemployment, the immigration intake, in the near term, should remain at around its current levels. The Coalition does not consider there should be any significant variation in the immigration intake at this time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Then the minister attacked the Labor Party for what he says is the family stream taking up 70 per cent of the program. What did the coalition say before the election about the family program? They said:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       The family unit is the foundation of our society, and must be at the core of immigration (and settlement) policy.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       Although the definition of family may differ from one culture to another, for recent settlers the importance of the immediate family unit (husband, wife, dependent children) as the primary organ of support and dependence is paramount.

       Our goal, wherever possible, is to reunite dislocated families. Dependants of the family unit must receive priority in our annual immigration intakes.

       The minister made allegations that the program was widely rorted. In the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election statements, he said, accurately:

      <para font-size="-=2">

       We have always accepted that. There was a film in the United States about people who sought to abuse the green card system there. It will occur.

      <para first-indent="16">
       Turning now to humanitarian and refugee programs, the minister is now going to roll the extended families of people who come here in the humanitarian and refugee program into the program itself. On top of a reduction of the program from a baseline of 13,000 to 10,000, this will mean the program will be reduced by another 30 per cent approximately. So, effectively, the coalition government has halved the humanitarian and refugee program. But what did it say before the election in its own manifesto? It said:

        Contrast the minister's claims about what was the state of the migration program before the coalition took office. On the one hand, he says demand was slowed because of the recession. He said:

        The minister is also obviously seeking to abuse the intent of the Migration Act. Section 51 does allow the minister to consider applications in such order as he considers desirable. This section puts that in context when it says:

The minister cannot do this either. Section 47 of the act says that the minister is obliged to consider a valid application for a visa. The minister knows these things, but he is being sent on an errand now to pursue an agenda other than his own.

        In conclusion, we believe that, if a choice has to be made, if we are going to have low immigration—and both sides of politics agree there is to be low immigration at times when Australia does face high unemployment—the Howard government has chosen to make families lose out; Labor will not.

What is the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) doing by way of support for United Milk? What are the Queensland National Party members doing to support the cooperatives in their electorates—for instance, the electorate of Capricornia? There are two very important cooperatives in the seat of Dickson; the Fairfax electorate has two cooperatives; the Fisher electorate has eight; the Groom electorate has three; the Hinkler electorate has three very important cooperatives, including the large South Johnston Mill; the electorate of Kennedy has seven; the Longman electorate has five, the Maranoa electorate has eight; and the Wide Bay electorate has 14. These cooperatives are the backbone of the agricultural marketing industry in the state of Queensland. It is very distressing that National Party members have given no more than lip&amp;hyphen;service to their support for the cooperative companies.

        The member for Dawson deserves special mention in the House. She has told people in her electorate that she did not vote against this measure because of the pecuniary interest concern. She used a false alibi under standing order 196. Standing order 196 states that the member should only abstain from the vote if this was a matter other than public policy. Of course it is public policy. It is government policy. It is the Treasurer's policy to do in the Mackay Sugar Mills in the electorate of Dawson. There is absolutely no reason under the standing orders of this House why the member for Dawson should properly abstain from the vote. She has set up a false alibi as the only reason she can give people in her electorate for not voting against this particular measure.

        The Labor Party is strongly in support of cooperatives. I mentioned earlier in debate that it is a strange divide that has emerged in 1996 in Australian politics. It is the Labor Party and the other non&amp;hyphen;government groupings in the Senate that are supporting, in the words of Senator Margetts, `Agrarian, small commodity capitalism,' which is a pretty good way to describe the importance of the cooperative movement around Australia.

         —This Senate amendment relates to items 17 and 18 in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. The proposal in the original bill was to remove the tax deduction that cooperatives have long been able to claim for government loans used in the purchase of assets. In order to help these cooperatives gain their place and to add value in regional Australia, these tax arrangements were put in place about 60 years ago. Of course, it is regional Australia which needs to have these opportunities to value add to its dairy products, to its sugar and to its
         <break page="8540" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The opposition here—the Labor Party—has done what the National Party could not do. We actually stepped into the breach and did the job. We have successfully moved an amendment in the Senate to repeal the subsection and replace it. This is a win for the opposition and members in regional areas will benefit from this win.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The National Party has failed its constituency. Once it was a party that went in to bat for regional Australia, now it is a party that is not prepared to stand up for regional Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is rolling through. Liberal members in regional seats have also been rolled over. They won't stand up.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The lack of fight in the present backbench of this government is very frightening for regional Australia. Many farmers and people in rural and regional areas who are just recovering from drought—some, of course, now from flood—would have been affected if these amendments had not been made. But we understand that the Treasurer is basically saying that in the future he will get over these amendments and make the changes to the law that he wants.

        I am concerned that these cooperatives are now under threat from foreign capital that will come into Australia and which will take over these cooperatives in the future. So all the regional areas with co&amp;hyphen;ops will lose that local ownership that exists within their regions and that will be taken over by foreigners. The foreign capital will flow in and take over these co&amp;hyphen;ops. That will be on the heads of the National Party and these regional members of the Liberal Party. They stand condemned, like my colleague from Tasmania the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who really did not stand up for UMT, the 400 workers within that plant in Braddon and some of the farmers who feed into those cooperatives from my electorate.

        Coming from a regional seat, I understand that regions have got real problems. They are in real difficulties.

As I said, I believe that in the future, foreign capital will come in to take over our cooperatives and the Treasurer will assist that in the future.

You know the way he talks when he doesn't like things, when things are going against him, when he has been done, when he has been rolled—he comes in with gritted teeth and simply says, `We have to pass it tonight but wait until next time, because we'll be back next time, we'll move it next time.'

On the night that we debated it last, he was celebrating. He had got his industrial relations legislation through because of the deal with the Democrats. He was out celebrating. He left the management of this affair to the Treasurer to get the issues through the parliament and the Treasurer bungled it as badly as the Leader of the House, rather than allowing debate on this and allowing the free expression of opinion from the cross&amp;hyphen;benches.

During the course of the debate on amendment No. 3 he was invited to clear up the concern that is evident from his earlier comments that, in fact, this is really a ruse to tide him over until next year when he hopes to have the numbers to roll the people in his own party again who do not support his views on this matter and cobble up a majority in the Senate, if he can, so that he can put the matter through the Senate some time during

        I think it is worth recalling what the cooperatives themselves have been saying to the government on this matter. The National Cooperative Council of Australia wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) expressing their concern about what this government was proposing to do. They pointed out that cooperatives are, by definition and structure, locally owned, private Australian business operations who play significant roles in the export of value added primary production. They made some interesting observations about the effects of the government's planned imposition of a new tax on them. They said.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The cooperatives' ability to raise development capital is restricted and has in some instances seen the cooperatives turn to public listing and subsequently multinational ownership. Governments for 66 years have recognised the need for an alternative means for such cooperatives to raise development capital and have supported the maintenance of section 121(c) since its national introduction in 1930.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, everyone except this Treasurer. Everyone except this Treasurer is driven by an ideological commitment to see his view of the private sector imposed upon all in the community. The National Cooperative Council of Australia made another telling observation about the effects of this government's policy when they said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        A number of large cooperatives have had takeover offers from multinational companies in recent years. Those same predator companies are also buying strategic holdings of land and vertically integrated processors for the goods that those cooperatives produce. Directors of the cooperatives would have little alternative at law but to recommend acceptance and sell out regional businesses if the government takes away the incentives for cooperatives to remain as Australian businesses.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the effect of what the Treasurer wanted to do. That is the effect of what he forced through this parliament and what would have occurred but for the intervention of the Labor Party and its amendment in the Senate and the support we received from the minor parties.

         The simple fact is that the policies driven by this government, particularly by this Treasurer, are designed knowingly to see the shift of resources from cooperatives not just into the private sector but inevitably into multinational hands. The evidence is there already, the cases are there already and there is the vertical integration already occurring in areas in which these cooperatives operate. Of course, these cooperatives operate in the primary sector—the primary industry: sugar, dairy products, meat products and fruit products. They operate in the traditional country growing areas—areas which the National Party once took some pride in representing.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Many of those cooperatives that rely upon this benefit are in Queensland. In fact, the overwhelming majority of cooperatives in Australia that are involved in the primary sector are in Queensland. It is more than passing strange that this House is populated with so many Liberal and National Party members from Queensland.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are more Liberal and National Party members from Queensland than there are Liberals from Victoria. All bar two of the federal seats in Queensland are held by Liberal and National Party members. How do they repay that support they got at the March election? They repay it by turning on regional Queensland and inflicting upon them imposts in costs which would inevitably result in the loss of their cooperatives, the loss of the primary producers in ownership of those lands and seeing consumers faced with the prospect not of being able to buy locally owned, locally grown produce put through the farmers' cooperative, but locally grown, foreign owned, foreign processed food and product that would be put through the balance sheets of companies abroad.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is the way in which the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party government has repaid the support it got from regional Queensland. Members in this parliament from Queensland and regional centres have not come into the parliament to even raise a voice against it in this debate.

        This provision will clarify the meaning of section 121(c). There has been confusion. It was expressed no better than by Mr Howard, a Mr Howard who actually supports cooperative companies. He appeared before the Senate legislation committee. He was representing the Cooperative Council of Australia and the Cooperative Federation of Queensland. He had this to say:

        Unfortunately, that has not been an interpretation that the Australian Taxation Office has been placing on 121(c). It has been saying that the cooperative must acquire assets from a government in order to write off a loan from that particular government source. This amendment clarifies the meaning so that the taxation concession will apply to the acquisition of assets from government sources or non&amp;hyphen;government sources. Very clearly, the parliament is making its intention known to the Taxation Office.

        The opposition is pleased that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is supporting this particular Senate amendment. It must be appreciated that it is only under sufferance. It is not a change in government policy; it is only a recognition that the Senate has him over a barrel. On other issues he has tried to beat his chest and make loud noises about his determination to do them over. Now they have got him over a barrel and he is rolling right over. But it does not signify a change in government policy. That is the important thing to understand for all the supporters and employees of cooperative companies around Australia.

All he has recognised is the folly of trying to roll eight unrelated measures into an omnibus bill—the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3)—and the fact that the Senate has made these amendments and has put him over a barrel. He is going to do nothing more than try to secure some of the savings on R&amp;D—savings that the Labor Party has opposed—but has not ruled out a change in government policy on cooperatives. That is a very important thing. Without a change of policy and without a recognition of the importance of cooperative companies to regional Australia, there can be no security for those ventures nor their employees. That is the very important thing.

        The Treasurer should now be announcing a change of government policy. Next year he will not attempt to abolish section 121(c) of the tax act. Not only that, but he will also accept the virtue of a clear definition of its provisions so that the assets can be acquired both from government and non&amp;hyphen;government sources. The Labor Party is doing these things because we believe in the future of cooperative companies. We believe in Australian ownership in the food industry in these cooperative ventures that have been supported by government for some 60 years under the provisions of 121(c).

        We also note that any clarification of the meaning of the clause would be a low cost to the government. We know the cost is not large because the government itself would not be saving a lot of money by its original plan to abolish the provision. The government would be saving no more than $2 million for this financial year by its plan to abolish 121(c)—no more than $6 million in a full year. So for such a small amount of money so much damage would have been done to regional Australia and to the cooperative movement in Australia. They were facing slow death without the rescue action of the Australian Labor Party.

        In essence, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has secured major savings for the Commonwealth through the agreement of the Senate both to abolish syndication and to reduce the rate of deduction under R&amp;D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. We welcome the fact that the Australian Democrats in the Senate supported the Liberal government in closing down rorting under syndication. We also note that the Labor Party, because it had introduced syndication, even though it was aware that it was now leading to rorting, was unwilling to take action to protect the revenue. We give the Labor Party the benefit of the doubt that it made the decision in error. It probably would have liked to reconsider it but, because of the position taken by some of their spokesmen, they were unable to do so.

        The fact is that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has now secured savings to the Commonwealth in relation to R&amp;D matters in the vicinity of $2.2 billion over a period of four years.

        Let us understand the importance of this amendment that has come back to us. The Treasurer talked about the essence of his legislation, but let me tell you what the essence of R&amp;D and syndication is. It is about getting small groups together. It is about recognising that it is not just the big companies that invest in research and development in this country, but small groups that cannot of themselves raise the capital. Nor, because they have just started up in business, can they claim a tax deduction.

        It is for that reason that what syndication does is enable them to use the tax loss and carry it forward through groupings to get into real research and development in this country.

This government has attempted to abolish syndication without any understanding of what it really means.

         This is a government that runs around the country saying, `We are abolishing syndication because they are into rorts.' Yet not one rort has been proven. Not one! The Treasurer put his name to a press release with the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) when these schemes were abolished talking about actual examples of research and development, actual examples of rorts—four examples. Do you remember them, Treasurer? He is not looking. Usually he is the first one to respond to an interjection, but he has got his head buried in something else.

        The serious matter, of course, in amendment No. 5 is making the point that running down R&amp;D is not an answer to Australia's economic problems. Running down the clever country agenda is not an answer to Australia's economic dilemmas. There is no doubt that there are many failings in the government's budget strategy, but running down R&amp;D and running down the clever country agenda is foremost among those failings.

        In a country like ours there are limits on fiscal policy. I think both sides of politics now recognise the limits on fiscal policy. With unacceptable national savings it is very hard for Australia to grow faster than its trading partners without getting a spillover on the external account. You do not necessarily have to drive down spending power, as this government is doing with its budget strategy, but you do want to keep it in a nice balance, understanding the limits of fiscal policy with regard to the external account. So in those circumstances, of course, both sides of politics support higher national savings.

        The one thing that becomes critical in those circumstances is to get the exogenous boost to growth—to get the boost to growth that does not come out of the business cycle; to get the boost to growth that does not come out of spending power; to get the boost to growth that does not come out of the simple

You do not get it from cutting research centres and you do not get it from running down the taxation concessions available for research and development. So this is a dumb thing to do. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) is following dumb policy whenever he runs down R&amp;D, whenever he runs down universities, whenever he runs down research centres and whenever he runs down the opportunity for the Australian economy to enjoy the exogenous boost to growth.

        I know he has problems with these concepts because, when he rolled in as Treasurer on 3 March and the Treasury put all those papers in front of him, it all looked so confusing. They have a very limited model. They have a model that does not really believe in a boost to growth that comes outside the conventional model, a boost to growth that comes from outside, exogenous to the normal economic model. Over at the Treasury they do not have these things factored in, so he is not getting his mind around them. When they present him with the dictum that any cut is a good cut, he forgets that every single cut is different and

So the Treasurer has trouble getting over these concepts; they were not laid out there in that big mass of papers that looked so confusing on 3 March. He has not got his mind around them, and that is why he needs to read up on some of these exogenous growth theories, some of the new economic thinking that he will not find in the Treasury department.

        The exogenous growth theories will highlight that, in Australia's circumstances with the fiscal limits, the possibility of spillover effects on the external account and the issues concerning national saving, the smart thing to do is to be a clever country—to boost R&amp;D, to boost universities, to boost research centres, to get a boost to growth in productivity from outside the conventional economic model, from outside supply and demand and spending power, to get the boost that can only come from being a clever country.

        So why does the Treasurer want to run down R&amp;D? Why doesn't the Treasurer want Australia to be a clever country? What sort of government would cut university funding to the bone, all because of flawed dogma, believing that every cut is a good cut? Some cuts can be very bad and actually be counterproductive to the economy, and this is one of them. It should be reversed.

        My electorate has a copper mine, Mount Lyell at Queenstown, which operated for 100 years with four generations of miners. The company that was there with a lease decided that it was time to leave. They had been
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         putting their tailings in the river for 100 years. It was one of the last rivers in the world, I think, to still have tailings in it. There was an agreement made with the state government that the lease would go. That company left Queenstown, the town that had been dependent on mining for over 100 years.

        But another company had the courage to come in, meet the environmental standards and build new tailing dams. It has taken on mining copper and small quantities of gold from Mount Lyell in the belief that there is still plenty of copper there below the original ore body. To do so they need the opportunity to develop, through their research and development, a new process of obtaining the copper from the ore without having to ship out the ore to other countries. They want to do that. They were in syndication and battling to achieve their goal by using a leaching process—with a bacterium, I believe—to get the copper out of the iron ore. And they were fair dinkum. They were in syndication with several other companies to achieve their goal. They were putting in, and they were paying to do this with the opportunity of claiming their 150 per cent. The project would probably be worth 40 jobs in the longer term to people on the west coast of Tasmania, a place where jobs do not come that easily. In my electorate—the west coast—jobs are hard to come by, and this was an opportunity to generate more jobs.

I note that the significance of this amendment is that it does allow partnerships to effectively get into the cooperation arrangement for research and development. To the extent to which the essence of R&amp;D was getting cooperation, we have been able to preserve an element of it through partnerships.

         I was interested to note that, when the Treasurer was introducing this amendment and saying that they supported it, he said that the government would be making sure through legislation that this provision could not be used to recreate the syndicated proposals of before. What is very interesting in that regard is that the Labor Party moved this amendment in the Senate last night to insert `unless the financing of the proposed research and development expenditure is to be fully at risk and not involve any element of a guaranteed return to any investor', and the govern ment voted against it. Here we have a Treasurer saying that there are rorts which he cannot ever justify while he puts out fraudulent examples. I say `fraudulent examples' because we had Minister Moore the other day saying, when I asked him why he had used `actual examples' when they were not actual:

        The fact remains that you voted against our proposed amendment to ensure that there had to be an `at risk' circumstance and there could not be any element of guaranteed return to any investor.

        The other point I will dwell on is the crowing of the Treasurer, saying how much the government have saved by abolishing research and development syndication. Let us look at what the abolition of syndication saves the budget over four years. Their original proposal was $670 million, but from that has to be deducted the $340 million which has gone into the START program. So at best you have a net $330 million, from which you now have to deduct, as a result of the next amendment that you are going to cop—another one that you have been rolled on—another $160 million for research syndication.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In other words, your great savings from abolishing research and development syndication are, at best, $170 million over four years. You have thrown the baby out with the bathwater for that amount of money. You have tried to argue that there are billions of

        The fact of the matter is that your big savings come from abolishing the 150 per cent tax concession, which you have taken down to 125 per cent. Syndication saves you very little, yet your great railing in public has been the need to abolish syndication. You have failed in that regard and you have fraudulently pursued your case.

        Amendments Nos 6 and 7 relate to the transitional arrangements for the removal of syndicated R&amp;D. The amendments allow those syndicates which had lodged applications for registration with the Industry Research and Development Board before 23 July 1996 to be considered for registration. The government estimates that this will allow approximately 16 syndicates to proceed. A number of other syndicate applications lodged with the IR&amp;D Board before the government's announcement are now being considered under the newly established START program.

Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall question time after question time where the Treasurer has said that syndication was nothing more than Labor rorts, nothing more than rewarding the big end of town—but they, the Liberal Party, would not. There was no consideration given to the fact that in small and medium business you have a real difficulty providing capital to it. In fact, we have a great capital shortage. There was no reference to the fact that syndication had worked as a means of allowing small and medium sized companies to undertake a disproportion amount of research. Sure, the syndicates get a tax advantage but capital was going in to fund the research and development. None of that! No explanation from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who is not even in the chamber, I might add.

The Treasurer time and time again was allowed to get to that dispatch box and say that this was a Labor rort and he was going to end it. Of course, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), with or without quotation, has pointed out, there was not one scintilla of evidence offered to this place at question time, in the debate or in the Senate to sub stantiate a vicious, nasty, mean charge that something that we thought was vitally important—research and development—was nothing more than a Labor rort.

        If we are not owed an apology—and I would argue that we are on this side—then, surely, at least the business associations, small business, medium business and the people of Australia who listened to the Treasurer's charges that he made or these statements that he made and took them to heart, probably believed them, deserve to know what the true position is.

        I cannot invite the minister for industry to come up to the dispatch box and make an explanation or an apology. He has not even shown this House the courtesy of being here. But I think we can ask the Treasurer, who of course was the one at question time making these points. So I invite the Treasurer—and I hope that the Chief Government Whip has encouraged him—to make an apology, to say that he was wrong, and then we can get on and acknowledge the good sense the Senate had to support the amendment which the opposition advocated in the very first instance.

In the presentation of his budget, he tried to say to the working people of Australia that this was a government that was attacking the tax system at the wealthiest extremes, and he has tried to use the argument about syndicated R&amp;D and other parts of his budget to say that the government was trying to shield working families from higher taxes and was trying to place the burden on higher income earners in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The smokescreen has now been blown away. The argument that is sustainable out of the budget is that the great burden of government tax falls on the average working PAYE taxpayer. The great burden of this government's tax policy falls on the average PAYE taxpayer—an 8.3 per cent increase in the taxation collection of gross PAYE. That is, under the last budget of Treasurer Willis, for every $100 paid in the last budget of the former government, they are paying $108.30 in gross PAYE to Treasurer Costello in his first budget—an increase of 8.3 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The great shame of that, of course, is that this is at a time when the Treasurer talks about low inflation: low inflation delivered by the former government. When he talks about stable price settings in Australia, there can be no argument for increasing the gross take on PAYE by 8.3 per cent. And, of course, that just demonstrates the total fraud, the total misrepresentation of the first Costello budget. It is a budget, in its taxation impact, hitting the average Australian working family; hitting average Australians out there in the regions and the suburbs of this country; hitting them
        <break page="8553" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         through PAYE—not hitting them at all through syndicated R&amp;D and allegations of rorts, because you can't hit people unless you have got evidence. You can't hit people unless you have got examples. You can't hit people unless you have got something to sustain your case.
        </break>
       </para>

        The Treasurer, really, has reached the point where he needs to put up or shut up. It is put up tonight about syndicated R&amp;D or it's shut up in the House of Representatives question time. It is put up about all the rhetoric you have been developing over the past couple of months or it's shut up when it comes to question time. And the Treasurer has really been found short. He has been found terribly short in these matters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The thing about the early months of government, of course, is that it looks so easy. You can say things, hoping—almost knowing—that the accountability day is somewhere down the track, that the chickens won't come home to roost; but in this instance they have. And the Treasurer has got himself into a dilemma where in all these things—the mismanagement of fiscal policy, the abolition of wages policy—it will take time for the full accountability to be echoed around Australian pubic opinion, but on this matter of syndicated R&amp;D, the accountability day has arrived. The accountability time is right now in the House of Representatives. The Treasurer has got to do more than just sign his Christmas cards there with a blank look on his face. He has got to match up all that rhetoric with a bit of evidence; and if he doesn't, then this will undoubtedly be justification for the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), justification of all the things he has been saying on the public record, and it will put down all the allegations that the Treasurer has been making as nothing more than a smokescreen—a smokescreen to disguise the true taxation impact of his budget, which is to slug the working family with an 8.3 per cent increase in gross PAYE collections. So, come on, Treasurer, it's put up or shut up.

         —The Treasurer (Mr Costello) owes it not only to the parliament but to the Australian economy to produce the evidence, because how can the private sector have confidence in a Treasurer who makes allegations only to slur; who makes allegations only to score political points at question time? How can the private sector have confidence in a Treasurer who makes allegations only to slur, not to improve the strength of the Australian taxation system, not to improve the strength the Australian economy? That is the way his reputation will stand on this final parliamentary sitting day.

        For a moment we got very excited because the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) rode into the parliament, but he saw the burning wagons and he rode straight out again. The next reinforcement was the member for Makin (Mrs Draper). The government sent in the member for Makin, hoping that in her wide travels around parliament house late at night she might have found some of the evidence of rorted syndicated R&amp;D. But no, it did not come from the member for Makin. So they sent in the next tier of reinforcements. It was the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan).

          Party style, without the courage of fronting up and putting up—after so much debate, after so much consideration. It is like extracting teeth on this side of the House. At last the Labor Party has got a minister on the record who claims that he has the evidence. Perversely enough, it is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training! God only knows how they have been running schools policy if the minister has been looking after the evidence of rorted syndicated R&amp;D. Does this mean that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is actually running schools policy in the government—that they have swapped roles? They wander in and out of the different doors of Parliament House like a Marx brothers movie—they are actually wandering around each other's portfolio.

         —While we are getting it in writing, I rise to second the amendment. This has only become important now because of the intervention across the table by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). We have been trying to get the government all night and all afternoon to produce one item of evidence demonstrating rorting under research and development syndication. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) at least was smart enough, given that he has no evidence—and I think we have demonstrated that, because he scurried out of the chamber after three hours of debate not having responded to any request from us, but at least he had the sense to shut up. Not the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training who could not contain himself! I wonder why. He was the only member of the tactics committee that got an honourable mention today by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). He must be doing really well. I wonder when the promotion to cabinet is coming, Minister? We know how you got dudded on your expectation of it in March of this year. You have been burying away, busying yourself to try to get in there—undermining your senior minister, but at the same time picking up the loose tongue and utilising false statistics.

        But your assertion to me across the table was, `I know where the evidence of the rorts are'—this is the point to me—`and I learnt them by riding around in a Rolls&amp;hyphen;Royce.' If this is the basis upon which the government has made the decision to scrap research and development, let the country know about it! I do not travel around in Rolls&amp;hyphen;Royces, but I do have contacts in the business community. I don't deny that. I keep in touch. But I challenge the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to produce the evidence that he says is so apparent, which he says he knows and which he says that I know.

In fact, this could be the opportunity for the member for Goldstein to present his credentials as an honest minister.

        —On indulgence, a number of members have asked me the likely progress of the evening's affairs—they will be pleased to hear the Senate is still sitting. A number of matters are still before us. The industry research and development matter I think we will return to very shortly; hopefully that can be dealt with more expeditiously than the last matter. We still have social security. Workplace relations No.2 has gone through the Senate, we are waiting for that to come
        <break page="8563" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         through and there will be a debate on that matter. We still have health insurance and child care to go, so it will still be a long night. I am not able to give you as yet an indication of the time—as soon as I am able to do so I will of course. We would appreciate any cooperation as members flit in and out of the opposition Christmas party.

        . . . is mostly a function of which fragments of the public have the incentives and resources to organize around immigration issues. As it turns out, those who benefit from immigration in direct and concrete ways are better placed to organize than are those who bear immigration's costs. Immigration tends to produce concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, giving those who benefit from immigration greater incentives to organize than persons who bear its costs.

        That analysis of international immigration policy and how it is formed in settler countries, such as South Africa, Israel, Canada, Australia et cetera, was of course preceded by comments of a similar nature in this country in the 1988 committee to advise on Australia's immigration policies. In that document that committee—which did have an influence on where the policies were going—made the criticism that, although planning does involve consultation with various interest groups, these groups are unrepresentative and consultation is private. Furthermore, policy involves a consensus of political views around a common ideological position unsupported by general public opinion.

        What those articles are saying is that essentially the immigration debate is largely driven by those with an immediate interest. The general public does not have a very big say in it. I have to say that, even within the major political parties, there has been an unwillingness and a lack of trust in the public to actually discuss these issues. This long preceded the drive by people like Hanson to stir up concerns about this and other related policy areas.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        In 1996 nearly two thirds of Australians think that the intake is too high. One sub&amp;hyphen;group, however, continues to stand apart from this trend: people with a university education, especially those university&amp;hyphen;educated people who have a migrant background themselves.

        She further said:
       </para>

        . . . it seems that many Australians are worried about job competition and about increasing levels of cultural diversity. However, many university&amp;hyphen;educated Australians are relatively immune to these worries. Few among them actively want immigration to be increased, but the proportion saying the numbers are too high is lower among them than among less privileged groups. But the association between education and worries about immigration is not linear. The most worried group are not those with no post&amp;hyphen;school training at all. Rather it is the group with trade and other non&amp;hyphen;tertiary qualifications which shows the most concern.

        I want to emphasise the earlier point I made about the concentration of non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background people in my electorate being related to another crucial statistic regarding the nature of my electorate—that is, in the entire country, whilst my electorate has the eighth highest concentration of non&amp;hyphen;English speaking constituents, it is the sixth highest in regard to unemployment. That is no statistical mistake. That is not an aberration. There is a clear connection. What we are getting at is the clear connection between the need for English and employment. I quote an article by Clive Brooks:
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        Immigrants, especially those from a non&amp;hyphen;English speaking background, do have higher unemployment rates than the Australian born . . . all [studies] are in agreement that unemployed immigrants are less likely to receive unemployment benefits than their Australian born counterparts . . . While the proportion of the unemployed who were receiving unemployment allowances was increased over the 1990&amp;hyphen;92 recession, a higher proportion of the Australian&amp;hyphen;born unemployed were receiving unemployment allowances than the overseas&amp;hyphen;born.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
        It is clear that NESB immigrants, when compared with the Australian&amp;hyphen; born, are less likely to participate in the labour force (partly due to NESB immigrants being more likely to be discouraged in their job search) have higher rates of unemployment and are more likely to be underemployed.

        One of the thrusts of the government's policy in this legislation is to increase the charges by a very massive amount—250 per cent—for those who require to learn English. I, for one, have no dispute with the government's intention to try to maximise the employability of the intake, because unless we do, political parties will have increasing difficulties in defending the refugee intake and even in the long term the family intake.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are very strong reasons to try to ensure that, as far as possible, without being discriminatory. If I have criticisms of the inclusion of English points in the family intake, I do not see it as a racist action by the government. Quite clearly, one might dispute it because one should say there should be none of these restrictions in regard to family reunion. But to say that it is intrinsically racist is very simplistic, because the reality of the nature of the intake is that we are saying, essentially, that if there are two Korean fitters
        <break page="8566" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and turners who are equivalent in all other senses, then if one is better at speaking English, that person is more likely to be employed in this country. That is the outcome of all statistical work done by the BIR. Every document that they have produced over the last decade and a half has consistently shown that association between English and employability.

        So on the one hand I do not think there should be so much resistance to that kind of measure by the government, but on the other hand I think the opposition is very clearly concerned, as part of their worries with this legislation, by the very significant increase in English charges. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has failed to allow the opposition the opportunity to separate that from the other charges which the opposition is clearly supporting.

        The aspect of our requirements in regard to the cohabitation period for de facto and same sex couples is clearly a discriminatory provision. We have had some government members trying to defend it on the basis that they see it as less of a relationship than marriage. This is going to do very little to avoid fraud. It is essentially of a similar fashion to the government's measure deciding that people have to wait in line once they are married to get into this country.

        The coalition have repeatedly shown that their agenda is about discouraging migrants, especially migrants from non&amp;hyphen;English speaking backgrounds, from coming to Australia. This legislation represents more hoops for prospective migrants to have to jump through before they are permitted to emigrate to this country. Never mind that their partners, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers or children are already citizens of this country and are living here. If you happen to pick the wrong time of the year to get married, when the coalition's quota for spouse visas has been filled, it is just too bad. The first come, first served system can hardly be called fair.

Surely you would think that with all their rhetoric about the family, the government's policy arm, known as the Lyons Forum, would object to the legislation before this House, that the Lyons Forum would make sure that this government was in favour of someone being able to care for their aged parents or look after their dependent children or be reunited with their spouse, or does the Lyons Forum only support families when it applies to white, Anglo&amp;hyphen;Celtic, fifth generation Australians?

         Australia and one for people who have immigrated to our country. They are trying to make it harder. It wants to increase the fees for prospective migrants: the visa application fee is up over 200 per cent, the English education charge is up by nearly 250 per cent and the health services charge is now going to be applied to all of the preferential family category. Not only is the coalition increasing the charges to $12,500 per person—that is, up to $50,000 for a family of four—but it then expects migrants to survive in Australia with no financial assistance for the first two years, while they should be using that time to learn English so they can enter the Australian work force adequately prepared.

        This bill will also result in exemptions being made under the Sex Discrimination Act to allow the minister to require that de facto spouses and interdependent couples—that is, same sex couples—must live together for two years before they are permitted to migrate. At least this bit of the bill is consistent with the pro family, moral posturing of the Lyons Forum that we have come to expect.

        The coalition's acceptance of marriage as somehow superior and more genuine than a de facto relationship really does hark back to the 1950s. It is apparently not enough for couples to demonstrate their interdependence. The government wants to make it even harder. Since the election I have seen hundreds of constituents in my office seeking assistance with immigration. People applying for visas on the grounds of interdependency, in particular, are an extremely small minority who already have to go to considerable lengths to prove the bona fides of their relationship.

        For same sex couples, the requirement to live together for two years may simply be impossible in some countries, and the minister must know that. For gay and lesbian couples, it is often simply not possible for them to live together in safety outside Australia.

        However, in countries where divorce is restricted, living in a de facto relationship is not necessarily a possibility anyway; that is, unless a couple is prepared to be marginalised or even vilified by the local community for their actions. It does not take a genius to work out that this measure is just another way of restricting the rights of an Australian to be with their chosen life partners if those partners happen to be non&amp;hyphen;Australian. As far as interdependent relationships go, the level of difficulty increases exponentially.

The Prime Minister had a chance in his state of the nation address—the longwinded humbug we all had to listen to the other day—to actually make a statement against the member for Oxley. I thought he might but he failed again, just like the government has failed in their responsibilities to promote in a genuine fashion—not through code—a multicultural Australia. I look forward to the minister next week, on those three occasions when I will be representing the shadow minister, giving the same sort of rhetoric which you give in here, because I am tired of hearing the contradictions in the government's position.

        This bill proposes to roll the migration health services charge, the English education charge and the visa application fee into one charge. The opposition, principally, is critical of all aspects of this change but opposes in particular the increase in the English education charge. As I understand it, the bill will raise that charge to some $5,500 per person. Unfortunately, the government refused to separate this charge in the bill; therefore, we
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         are in a situation where we have general opposition on this point. But the whole question of English charges is one that I would urge the minister to look at again. The fact is we have seen a general cutback in a range of other areas like employment, education and training programs, programs through neighbourhood houses and the general ESL provision. That really is at odds with the rhetoric.

        We talk about the fact that migrants to this country should speak English or should take the opportunity to speak English as soon as possible after their arrival. I certainly support that, I know the minister does and I am sure the House in general does. But we also have to question how we address that issue in the circumstances. Often when people come to a new country they have to deal with culture shock and the actual physical relocation. The circumstances they may well find, particularly initially after arrival, make it a very difficult change of circumstances. Essentially, that language barrier is a crucial aspect of those problems in resettlement.

         I find it hard to understand why on the one hand the government—and I agree with them on this—talk about the fact that English education is a crucial part of the settlement of migrants and on the other hand say, `But we will make it more expensive and in many areas we will cut back access to programs.'

        The minister knows the area that I represent quite well. I would not spend as much time with the minister as the member for Grayndler but I am sure he enjoys time with me more than he does with the member for Grayndler. However, the fact is the minister knows the area and he knows that in those circumstances in that area around Springvale and Dandenong there are a large number of migrants who have settled there and are still settling there. English language provision is a very serious issue in developing a cohesive, local societal structure. These cutbacks are having major impacts and will continue to have major impacts in giving migrants the chance to learn English to better integrate and develop into a part of mainstream Australian society. That is what they seek to do—we all know that—but I find this measure at odds with the rhetoric

        The bill also seeks to repeal section 87 of the Migration Act 1958 to enable the minister, among other things, to limit or cap the number of spouse, aged parent and dependent child visas that can be granted each year. This is a very difficult issue in many respects. I oppose capping. Straight&amp;hyphen;off capping, in my view, does not have any merit associated with the question of applications. Essentially, as I understand it, if your application happens to be one that is approved in the first part of the year before you reach the cap then you are successful; if it happens to be after that then you are in difficulty. I think those sorts of things are a real concern.

        I am sure many members from both sides of the House know, as I do, that the whole question of family reunion—the question of spouses, aged parents and dependent children—is very important in terms of the capacity of families to be able to settle. I have had, for example, in recent months members of the Chinese community approach me about the circumstances surrounding the likely results of spouse visas and they have expressed a real concern as to what that will mean to their families.

        No&amp;hyphen;one wants to see this situation rorted. There are examples where this has occurred. I do not think anyone is denying that. The question really is what do we do about it. It is a matter of natural justice. If you deny people the right of access to such a program through a capping mechanism, what you in the end really do is deny them justice. In those circumstances, I think it is an issue that needs to be looked at very seriously.

        As I said earlier, the nature of the settlement of families and individuals who have come from overseas means that it is very important for them, under the law, to be able to bring, if possible, members of their family to Australia.

A number of people have come to me on this issue in recent months showing real concern

        We also have to look at what makes multicultural Australia, as we all understand the term, an important vehicle for our society to move forward into the future.

I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups.

He opposed it in most eloquent terms, I must say, but he said it was wrong. But now he says it was right. Circumstances have changed. Now he is the minister. The minister is in a situation where, as the minister, he now feels that he is going to act upon this—do not listen to what I say, look at what I do. I raise real concerns about the minister in this situation. He is a minister I have got a fair bit of time for, as I have said before, but the fact of the matter is on this issue I think he is wrong and I think that his words earlier, in 1989, really get to the heart of the issue—that this is not a fair measure, it is not an equitable measure and it is a measure that ought to be opposed.

        The bill implements legislative exemption to the Migration Act 1958 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to allow the minister to prescribe a two&amp;hyphen;year cohabitation period for de facto and interdependency, or same sex, relationships. The issue here is really a question of why we are putting these categories of people in a situation where there is an especially harsh variation in terms of their particular circumstances. I will not go into detail about that but I do raise concerns about the way that is being handled.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also amends the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to allow the minister to deprive a person of Australian citizenship if the grant of citizenship was obtained as a result of knowingly committing and being convicted of migration relation fraud. No argument. That

       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the nature of the bill in terms of its significant aspects. Other speakers have taken the opportunity to make some more general comments with respect to immigration issues and I will make some comments now along the same lines. The fact is that at the moment there are two levels of debate occurring in Australian society on these sorts of issues. We are seeing more vitriolic and uninformed debate occurring through people such as the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and those who associate with her.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are also seeing debate occurring between government and opposition around the nature of our migration intake. The fact of the matter is that when we are talking in broad terms about the size of our intake, the nature of our intake, there is very little disagreement between the government and the opposition. The intake proposed by the minister, as I understand it, is at the average of the four years of the Keating government, so in reality we are not talking about a great difference here.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have also got another level of that debate and that relates to some of the comments that have been made by people such as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the rhetorical nature of the immigration debate in this country. We have seen comments along the lines of what is really happening is that we are bringing immigration back under control—we are in a situation where what we are doing is cutting it back, developing a situation where it is sustainable. What they are really doing, in the guts of it, is in fact what we were doing during the years of the Keating government. We have got to get back to the facts of the matter.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also what worries me about aspects of this—and I alluded to it earlier—is the real problem with the rhetoric of the government versus the actions of the government. We talk about the fact that we need to get people back into employment and then we cut employment training programs. We talk about the need for people to be privately insured, and then we develop a system which actually ensures that fewer people become privately insured. We
        <break page="8573" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         look at questions of immigration and issues around the question of, say, English education charges and the need for migrants to have English, yet we cut support to English language programs. So in our own way we have a situation where the government is making it more difficult for people to gain those skills and therefore better become part of mainstream Australian society.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That is one of the worrying aspects of part of the debate at the moment. There is a situation where not all the facts are on the table. There is rhetoric and there are actions, and when you compare them they do not match, they do not gel. That is a real worry about a number of things this government is doing and I think it is really a worry with the debate on immigration that is occurring at the moment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I encourage that debate. I certainly support free speech. I would also say, though, as many people have said, that that free speech needs to be exercised with a certain amount of due care. Many people have said that, on both sides of the House. What I am also saying beyond that, which is something the minister will not agree with me on, is that the level of care that has been taken by some individuals central to the political process in this country has been a little less than it should have been. When leaders in Australia emphasise certain aspects in their comments, or reiterate certain comments they make on various issues, they do create an impression. It was an issue that was often thrown at the previous Prime Minister. The opposition and others would latch on to particular comments he made, sometimes take them out of context and certainly give them undue emphasis and create an impression.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With, say, free speech—we certainly saw this some months ago, particularly in the case of the Prime Minister—certain issues have been emphasised. That emphasis in itself created an impression, and that impression created action and reaction. We are seeing some of that reaction in Australian society today. I know in my local area, particularly after some of the comments of the member for Oxley, issues of race are now a subject of open discussion, but not in the sense that they
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         should be—not in an informed sense; more in terms of what is the reaction that occurs as a result of these sorts of actions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We are seeing things like bashings and various forms of abuse—which I have not seen for some years, and in most cases not at all in my local area—which can be drawn straight back to that debate that is going on. That is very sad because I think that sort of debate, if held properly, calmly and sensibly, is a debate that is well worth having in terms of the size of the migration program and in terms of the nature of population sizes and the sort of society we want in the future. But it has got to be a debate not only based on facts but also steeped in facts. It has got to be a debate that is held very calmly and sensibly and by all parties. I think that there are some dangers associated with aspects of the way it has been handled. What it needs is a good, strong dose of leadership. We have seen some signs of that, but I do not think we have seen enough and I think a lot more has to occur at that level.

        Although the government has a program and has a right to pursue it, I guess, one of the sad things about legislation of this nature, in circumstances where we cannot get agreement and when some of the charges in that legislation are quite outrageous, is that the program of the government is becoming intertwined with the issues. I do not believe it is the intention of the minister to do that. I do not think that it is any way his intention, but it becomes part of the result. That in itself can detract from the overall debate and the sensible consideration of those issues in terms of the society we have and the society we want to have in the years to come.

I hope that the minister would have the sense, and I am sure he has, to look at these issues again and try to come up with a balance which suits the question of the needs of his government but also suits the need for a modern, multicultural society. That is an issue that I hope all members of the ministry take into consideration, from the Prime Minister down. It is certainly something that I hope will be reconsidered at cabinet level.

        Yesterday, when talking to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), I told him of some particular reasons I feel very strongly about the issue of Australia's immigration and culture. If you go back to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Commonwealth Law Reports
        </emphasis>
        of 1948, you will find the case of O'Keefe v. Calwell and the Commonwealth of Australia. The person involved was Mrs Annie O'Keefe, my father's aunty. She was the wife of an Army General of the Dutch East Indies, as it was then known. Her family was repatriated to Australia when her husband was assisting the Australians in the war. Her husband was killed, and she later married my dad's Uncle Jim.

       <para first-indent="16">
        One of my great shames is that the Labor minister for immigration at the time deemed that, under the White Australia policy, she was not eligible to remain in Australia, even though she had married an Australian citizen. There was an attempt to deport her. It became a widely debated case, and I believe it is the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         case at the centre of the famous `two Wongs don't make a white' statement that was made in this chamber. It is a matter of great pride to me that my father's aunty is of Asian origin, that that is part of our family and that the Labor Party has in fact earned an image in recent decades of overturning that whole concept of the White Australia policy and everything that went with it.

        Selection criteria have always focused on three aspects: the humanity that we have to other people around the world, which is embodied in our refugee and humanitarian programs; our respect for people's aspirations as families to be able to live together; and a desire to ensure that in any program we are seeking those skills and attributes that we might need here in Australia.

Nevertheless, the percentages of skilled migrants entering Canada are roughly equivalent to those who enter Australia at the moment in the family reunion categories. The humanitarian and refugee elements of our programs are roughly comparable.

They received cooperation from us in introducing the balance of family test for parents and also in introducing measures beneficial to Australian citizens compared with residents and, contrary to the shadow spokesman's so&amp;hyphen;called fact sheet, Labor's introduction of the 20 points for English in the independent category selection criteria.

         The fact is that, when those sorts of changes were made, they had cooperation from us. We have announced a smaller program. We have announced a more balanced program.

The fact is that the parliamentary committee got involved only as a result of an agreement between Senator Ray and me that the implementation of the migration policy that existed at that time would be subject to parliamentary committee review. It came after that bill had been introduced in that form. But the fact is that this was a measure that was contemplated by the Labor Party. They withdrew the provisions of capping for spouses, dependent children and aged parents because I raised it. The reason I raised it in my speech was that I thought it was a reasonable change to have achieved.

         The fact is that it was a very different situation when that was pursued. At the time we had a very much lower number of spouses who were seeking to enter Australia through the program. In 1988&amp;hyphen;89, 18,700 spouses and fiancees were approved for entry to Australia, representing 15 per cent of the total migration program. By 1995&amp;hyphen;96 these figures had ballooned to 33,550, representing 40.7 per cent of the program. That is the context in which we are addressing this issue now as distinct from the context in which this issue was addressed by me when it was first proposed by the Labor Party that capping, in relation to the spouse, dependent children and aged parents categories, ought to apply.

         —The opposition opposes schedule 1. Might I simply respond to a couple of points that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has made in closing the debate. The first point I should make is in relation to the 1989 legislation. I am not certain of the minister's recall—recalls in the partisan atmosphere of parliament seem occasionally to differ—but certainly his recall does differ from that of Senator Ray who was the then minister. Senator Ray has informed me that the provision that was inserted in the bill in a general way was never intended by the government to apply to immediate family relationships, that is, to husbands and wives, dependent children or that group within the elderly parents.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the issue was raised by the opposition, as a matter of prudence to make certain that it was absolutely clear, a provision was inserted into the legislation—that then had the support of all members of the Senate and of the House—that made it transparently clear that no government ever in the future could take such a step as the government is now intending to take. So we oppose schedule 1. We believe the minister was right when he rejected it as unconscionable in 1989 when he said that for a government to proceed in such a way would cause agony—and I imagine he meant both to itself and to those that it caused to suffer as a consequence thereof.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because I think the House really needs to pass from this measure relatively quickly—we have other matters coming before us soon—I will keep my remarks brief. But could I say something about cooperation. The minister said it seemed that I and my colleague the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) could not remember events of some two years ago. I would suggest to the minister he cannot remember events that have occurred since he has become minister, because he read out a whole range of issues in which he had provided cooperation to the former government when he was in opposition.
       </para>
       <break page="8581" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Might I mention to the minister that since he has been in the role that he holds he has sought my cooperation on a number of matters: for example, legislation to exclude third party legal touting in respect of people who are detainees at Port Hedland and other centres. He received that cooperation and we have supported that legislation despite widespread criticism. He has received our support on fraud control measures and for the introduction of two&amp;hyphen;year probationary visas. He has received our support on visa charges, although we think that he has increased charges and costs excessively and far beyond that which would ever have been anticipated by the electorate given the assurances that were provided by the coalition. We have permitted increased visa charges. We have permitted and facilitated the extension of a preclusionary period from six months to two years for unemployment benefits. There has been a whole range of matters where the Labor Party, as the opposition party, has accepted the responsibility that goes with being in opposition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister knows I have sat with him in his office on a number of occasions and put to him, for example, on de facto relationships the point that two years took the matter so far beyond what was reasonable that we could not possibly concede that to him but that if he were prepared to come back with a lesser period I would take it as part of my responsibility to go back to my colleagues and discuss it with them. The minister never came back to me with a proposal.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Essentially, we have had a political bagging exercise where the minister has stood up and said that he is not getting any cooperation, that the opposition is being entirely unreasonable and that it is forgetting its past. But, when you examine those things and actually dismember the facts from the rhetoric, the minister does not come out particularly well in terms of credibility. Indeed, his effectiveness is quite diminished by the fact that he cannot obviously see his way to persuading the Senate that these measures do have support of the nature that he says is appropriate for them.

          I will also respond, albeit very briefly, to a couple of specific points that the minister raised about the first schedule.
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           (Extension of time granted)
          </emphasis>
          The minister said that it would be doubted that a government would wish to prevent family formation and people bringing dependent children to this country. The fact is that those are the very powers he seeks in this legislation.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Every measure the minister has put forward for control of fraud has been agreed to by this opposition. The only marriages that would be affected by this capping measure are those which are bona fide. So what he is really seeking is a power to control bona fide, legitimate, familial relationships.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          I said earlier today that at a time of high unemployment both the Labor Party and the coalition run low immigration programs. This is the question: by what mechanism? We have said that families will not suffer, that Australia has to look after its own first. If a choice has to be made, let us make that choice in favour of our own and the right of Australians to bring their partners of choice to this country. Let us not make it in favour of foreigners with no relationship to this country, who will come here seeking employment in competition with Australians and who will relieve the burden that the government should rightly have of training Australians so that they can take up that employment.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Because of the tightness of time, I really should conclude my remarks. One specific point that the minister raised earlier in debate was the Canadian migration program. He pointed out that the Canadian migration program has a 50 per cent skilled component. That is true. But the minister failed to mention that the Canadian government has committed itself to a program of one per cent of its total population for immigration intake. So the total Canadian intake is some 200,000 per annum.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The Canadians can easily absorb anyone into Canada who wants to go there as a spouse, a dependent child or an elderly parent and still find 50 per cent for the skilled categories. So, too, could Australia if we had a one per cent program. That would be 180,000 people coming in. The problem is
          <break page="8582" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           that we have decided to be a low immigration nation. Having made that choice, something has to give. We say it should not be Australian families.

Just because he mentioned that he has a couple of people from International Law to give him some opinion does not mean that he has really dealt with this issue. We are going to pursue this issue, Minister, because what you are trying to do in the spouse category is contrary to basic fundamental issues of human rights.

        This bill gives effect to the undertakings made that day to provide a simpler, cooperative industrial relations system in Victoria which benefits employees and employers and the wider community. It relies on the referral of relevant matters to the parliament of the Commonwealth by Victoria's Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Bill 1996. This will allow the extended operation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 in Victoria without the restrictions arising from the limits of power available under the constitution. That wider operation will be in addition to the act's ordinary application.

        The Commonwealth and state legislation marks a highly significant point in the evolution of Australian industrial relations. It is also a very substantial step forward in micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform. In the development of the Australian constitution, apart from income tax matters, it would be hard to come up with an example of greater significance than the transfer of powers from a state to the Commonwealth.

The Victorian government deserves full recognition for its willingness to take such an historical initiative.

         I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill. Schedule 1 contains the amendments relating to the referral of matters by the Victorian parliament which will give wide legislative powers to the Commonwealth parliament, subject only to a number of limited and specific exemptions in the state legislation from the referred matters. On royal assent to the bill, a new part XV will be created in the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Division 1 of the new part will provide a framework for additional provisions which will be inserted by a proclamation of the remaining items in schedule 1. This will enable the relevant provisions of this bill to commence with the corresponding provisions under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996.

         —The opposition does not oppose this industrial relations legislation because the broad thrust of it, which is the transfer of industrial relations responsibility from Victoria to the Commonwealth, is a concept which we endorse. When all the hyperbole and superlatives about the magnitude and significance of the change are stripped away, all you are left with is that, once again, we have got from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) a pretty smart piece of politics and a second&amp;hyphen;rate piece of industrial relations. It is probably very good in advancing his interests, it is probably very good in his campaign against the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to be the next leader, and they probably think it does some good in the government's campaign against us. Maybe it does. I do not think the world is going to be determined either way by this particular piece of legislation.

        The problem is that it is really a second&amp;hyphen;rate sort of transfer. We welcome it—we will support it because it is better than nothing—but it is an important chance muffed. The truth of it is, of course, that the industrial relations system of the Victorian government is so unfair to working people in Victoria that any change, even a change to the Workplace Relations Act as passed by this parliament—my views about that are well known, but that has been passed; that is the law of the country and we accept it—is an improvement. We find ourselves in the situation where no workers in Victoria will be worse off as a result of this and some will be better off.

That is what the constitution provides in the

Some have and that is welcome, but some people have been excluded. That is not something we can do here because, as the Victorian Police Association itself recognised, that problem was caused by the nature of the reference by the Victorian parliament, not by this legislation.

So my submission to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we are seeing a best approach where there is this federal compact with the state of Victoria. That is what we are seeing occur here. In this respect, in some ways Victoria was really the forerunner of a revolution in industrial relations when they introduced their legislation two months after gaining office in 1992. It is interesting to observe what one commentator, in the

        It is also worth noting that the bill marks a transition to a new phase in state and federal cooperation. It will make access to the federal system easier for Victorian industry and workers. The inevitable legalism and complications of industrial relations under the

        I also welcome the new industrial relations legislation in my own state of Queensland, which has been put together by Santo Santoro, the relevant minister in that state.

Among those were many workers of both blue and white collar persuasions, but they did not include, of course, higher management echelons within the Victorian public service and those employees under the state emergency services act who, to their detriment, remained under the remnants of the Victorian industrial relations system.

There has been a white flag run up by the Kennett government as it has thrown its hands in the air, recognising that it lacks both the calibre and the wherewithal to deal with industrial relations in a way that is of benefit to either Victorian employees or employers. The Minister for Industrial Relations in Victoria, Phil Gude, has simply not been `Gude' enough and there is no doubt that his performance is under question and has been since that fateful day, 11 November 1992, when the first of a range of ongoing protests in the streets of Mel bourne was organised by various trade unions and employee groups.

        As honourable members would be aware, the Hawke&amp;hyphen;Cain&amp;hyphen;Kirner Labor governments at the federal and state levels had an opportunity to bring in similar legislation which the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), is now agreeing with, but they made no attempt to do so except to try to move some of the personnel in the Victorian system to the federal system. Yet, they broadly agree with what is being done now.

        This legislation simplifies the complex and unwieldy interaction between the federal and state jurisdictions. Traditionally, the Commonwealth has relied on a narrow band of constitutional powers to regulate industrial relations. The Commonwealth constitution gives the federal government the power to settle interstate industrial disputes through conciliation and arbitration. Thus the federal government has traditionally been constrained. It has traditionally set minimum wages through arbitrated awards, and the arbitration system has only been able to settle disputes of an interstate nature, as those of us who have had an interest in this matter would understand. That means the disputes have had to be contrived by artificial means—logs of unrealistic union claims—and the disputes have had to be interstate, so large unions had to serve the same log of claims on a large number of employers in different states to bring about a so&amp;hyphen;called dispute so they could develop their ambit log of claims.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These processes, as every member would know, are highly artificial and unwieldy. We have all seen these unrealistic logs of claims which unions have served on unsuspecting businesses for the sake of creating a dispute so they could get into the arbitration system which historically has existed but which now, after 1 January, will be done away with.

         have been alarmed by the sheer audacity of these ambit claims over the last 50 or so years to bring about these contrived disputes. The federal industrial relations system has also symbolically been based on disputes rather than agreement. That is a key feature, and I well recall my discussions with the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the former member for Corangamite, the Hon. Tony Street, when these matters were the key to those arguments in a bygone era when disputes were the norm in industrial relations discussions rather than a genuine desire to bring about an agreement between employers and employees. Of course, that mentality locked in the class warfare which had dominated industrial relations since its inception in the early 1900s.

        All the while, state jurisdictions have run their own industrial relations systems where the federal system did not apply. The state systems generally imitated the federal arrangements of compulsory conciliation and arbitration. More recently, agreement making has become a central part of the industrial relations systems in states like Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales when it was under a Liberal government. We saw dramatic changes in Western Australia, where there was a consensus view to move towards agreements rather than confrontation. Now in Victoria we have a single industrial relations system for all workplaces which will be governed by federal industrial law. From the average person's point of view, employees and employers alike, it will be quite a sensible and commonsense way to go. The federal Industrial Relations Commission will be able to modify the safety net of minimum conditions without the artificial contrivance of an interstate industrial dispute, as I have said.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Also, access to enterprise bargaining will not be limited to those workplaces which are incorporated—another important feature. In recent years the federal government has used the corporations power in the constitution to pass provisions in relation to enterprise bargaining. This has meant incorporated businesses have had access to those provisions while others have not had the same access to the federal enterprise bargaining
        <break page="8594" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         stream. For example, the non&amp;hyphen;union enterprise flexibility agreements contained in the Brereton act were based on the corporations power of the constitution. The High Court has recently upheld the use of the corporations power to base federal industrial relations laws.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new Australian workplace agreements contained in the Howard government's Workplace Relations Act 1996 also rely on the corporations power. So in most states the AWAs will be available to incorporated entities. In Victoria, other small businesses will also have access to Australian workplace agreements. It is estimated that only around 18 per cent of small businesses are both incorporated and respondent to a federal award—the two traditional prerequisites for non&amp;hyphen;union enterprise bargains.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So the transfer of powers with the passage of this legislation this morning makes the award system more workable and the enterprise bargaining system more accessible. The handover of industrial relations power from Victoria to the federal government will mean the federal unfair dismissal laws will apply in Victoria without having to rely on the external affairs power. As every employer brought to our attention during the election campaign, those unfair dismissal laws in the 1993 Brereton act were based on the external affairs power, using an ILO convention secretly signed by the Keating government in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the 1993 election.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Every Australian employer knew the quite damaging effect, both in impact and potential impact, of those unfair dismissal laws.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bottom line is that with the passage of this legislation there will be a single, simple and accessible industrial relations system in Victoria. It is clear that the safety net minimum conditions of Victorian workers will not be disadvantaged by the transfer. I note members opposite are happy with that and have not raised that point in their debate.

         The fundamental catalyst which has allowed this transfer of power to come about is the offer from the Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, and the passage of the new Workplace Relations Act by the Howard government led by the minister at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations, who has done a remarkable job, in my view. I again place on the record my admiration for his understanding of the details of this act and the other major act that passed through the parliament a few days ago.

         The Kennett government could never have handed over their industrial relations power to the former Keating government while Laurie Brereton's industrial relations act was in place.

         As members in this place would understand, in 1992 the Kennett government came to power in Victoria and inherited a massive crisis in a bloated public sector. They now have 50,000 less public service jobs. State debt was over $30 billion; there were massive unfunded liabilities in the state superannuation scheme; there was a series of financial disasters such as Pyramid; they had high unemployment; they had high rates of taxes relative to the rest of Australia; and they had a massive crisis of confidence. The Kennett government, as everyone in Victoria understood, had a very uphill reform task before it and has carried on in a very solid and constructive way in bringing about a change in that state.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the key reforms was to move to a more decentralised and flexible industrial relations system, getting away from the centralised, union dominated industrial relations system which had dogged both Victoria and Australia for the past century. This involved significantly downgrading the state arbitration system and moving employees across to workplace agreements and individual contracts. It was then that the Keating government in Canberra sought by all means possible to frustrate the direction and intent of those reforms.

        <break page="8595" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          The then federal government legislated in 1992 to make it easier for Victorian workers to move across to federal awards, giving their mates in the Victorian Trades Hall a temporary reprieve from their growing irrelevance in a decentralised Victorian system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Then in 1993, the Brereton Industrial Relations Reform Act sought to use the external affairs power to enshrine a whole series of minimum conditions from the above act in Victoria, including the notorious dismissal laws. So for four years, the Labor government in Canberra sought to frustrate Victoria's industrial relations reform. Members in this House would well recall the constant moves to shift those employees from Victoria to the federal system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Estimates as to the number of Victorian employees who transferred to the central system vary. One estimate suggests that the percentage of Victorian workers covered by federal awards rose from 40 per cent to 60 per cent between 1992 and 1994. More recently, the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Financial Review
          </emphasis>
          reported that some 20 per cent of Victorian workers were covered by the state system.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Clearly, on 2 March, there was a watershed election where industrial relations played a key part and the Howard government were elected very much on that platform of sensible industrial relations reform. This meant that the Howard government and the minister at the table were able to introduce a more flexible system with more accessible non&amp;hyphen;union workplace agreements; simplified awards; improved unfair dismissal laws which everyone around Australia applauded; voluntary union membership and an end to the closed shop no ticket no start; and tougher sanctions against irresponsible union behaviour.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Thus the Kennett government, by the decision just last month in Victoria, was in a position to entrust its industrial relations system to the Howard government at the federal level. So it is the best of both worlds and all Victorians will benefit. The less centralised, less union dominated federal industrial laws are philosophically in line with the Victorian government's general direction.

Small businesses in regions like my home town of Geelong will not have to contend with unions trying to drag their employees across to a federal jurisdiction through extravagant logs of claims. Employers and employees alike will have greater certainty as to where they stand in their workplace relations. What a big change from the situation that used to exist in Victoria. Importantly, all businesses will have access to the federal system whether or not they are incorporated entities.

          The 1995 annual report into enterprise bargaining in Australia indicates that, while enterprise bargaining is on the rise, it is still more predominant in large, unionised, public sector workplaces. It is an interesting set of figures. In 1995, 51 per cent of workplaces covering 68 per cent of employees experienced some form of bargaining at the workplace. Seventy per cent of the public sector workplaces bargained, compared with 43 per cent in the private sector. Of the workplaces that had some enterprise bargaining, 93 per cent had union members on the site—out of all proportion to the fact that only 30 per cent of the private sector work force is unionised. That is a very significant set of figures because we know that union membership is dropping quite rapidly in the private sector.

          Of the small businesses with no union members on site, only one per cent had a registered agreement. That clearly indicates the distrust that small businesses had with these agreements under the Brereton arrangements. Size also had quite a big impact: 81 per cent of the workplaces had more than 500 employees compared with 41 per cent of workplaces with 20 to 49 employees. So it was the bigger firms that were prepared to take on these arrangements and the smaller ones that could not understand and were not prepared to take the risks. Clearly, the smaller, private sector, non&amp;hyphen;unionised workplaces have not been engaged in enterprise bargaining at a federal level because of their concern that the unions would dominate the arrangements.

The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) indicated he favoured it because it was an example of cooperative federalism.

        But the paucity of logic in that analysis is that you cannot have powers flowing to and from the states depending upon which political party is in power either federally or at a state level.

        What I am saying, therefore, is that there is some inconsistency in the logic of the government members in favouring this advancing of federalism, but not looking at it with intellectual honesty as to how it can be achieved. The reality is that it will not happen entirely from cooperation. The fact is that it is most unlikely that there will be a coincidence of federal and state governments in power or that the political pressures in the states will be such that they will willingly transfer their powers.

        With respect to the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), he, again, replicated some inconsistency that has been revealed by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who on a number of occasions, particularly in question time, has got stuck into the opposition for relying on ILO convention 158 for the unfair dismissal provisions. But when you look at the current provisions in the Liberal government's act, it replicates and reproduces a reliance on ILO convention 158. So there is an inconsistency in the public position of the government and what the experts behind the scenes are doing to try to achieve the result—that is, to rely on the full gamut of powers, whether they be, as the member for Dickson pointed out, trade and commerce, external affairs or the corporations power.

       <para first-indent="16">
        My point is that if you are going to do it, do it honestly, do it openly and do it properly. Look at all those powers and do the task. Do not mouth supposed gestures towards states rights. At the same time, get the experts behind the scenes to rely on the totality of the armoury. There is room for logic and there is room for honesty and the government should approach its policy position on that basis.

         The other point I was going to make is that the significance of the government's steps here have been overstated. For instance, on the one hand, again, we have seen the inconsistency of mouthing this beneficial federalism. But when you look at the actual provisions of the workplace relations bill, they have actually walked away from federalism. For instance, an amendment to section 128 of the act will now actually preclude the federal commission from intervening in state proceedings if that state proceeding is considering a state industrial agreement or the approval of that agreement. Again, that is watering down the powers of the federal commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other relevant provision is the addition of a new section 152(3) which specifically states that the federal act will not intrude into the area of state employment agreements. So on the one hand we have the minister voicing and favouring federalism but on the other hand his actions in the act demonstrate an inconsistency because he is watering down federal powers.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I am saying to the government is: get your focus in order. You don't need to cringe about federalism when federalism is desirable, as it clearly is here. Be honest about it, rely on the full powers and do it properly. Don't do it by supposed concoctions and formulas and have inconsistencies in the existing provision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For instance, this legislation is not going to be so straightforward. Although there will be scope for a lot of Victorian employers who simply have local disputes to come into the federal system, the reality is that the federal system can still operate and intrude into the Victorian system by virtue of interstate industrial disputes extending into Victorian territory. The bill, as I read it, is quite silent as to how the federal commission is going to deal with an argument as to whether a dispute is entirely Victorian or Victorian extending interstate. That is going to be the source of quite some argument and quite some discussion and quite some cost.
        </para>

         Again, it is something which has not been done entirely properly. It has been a desirable
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          step forward but not a full and complete step forward. Indeed, my point is this: you are not going to have a full and complete step forward until you look at honestly saying, `This is an area where federal law should prevail. If it means overriding states rights, let's be honest about it, but let's do it.' Don't cringe from the intellectual honesty of stating when something is desirably a federal matter; take the bull by the horns and do it properly. You have not done that here.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What I am saying to government members is: there is no need to cringe, you are in government, you are professionals. Look at what you are about to achieve, look at how to achieve it and do it properly without being hamstrung by any underlying prejudices about necessarily preserving states rights for the sake of preserving states rights when it is quite illogical, inconsistent and impedes overall efficiency. Given the hour, that is about all I will say on the scope of the legislation. I will not venture into the actual technicalities that have been covered by the shadow minister.

         On 27 June 1996, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 9 May 1996. The Government affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports presented during the present Parliament within three months of their presentation and to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.

         The Government's commitment follows the undertaking by successive Governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in a timely fashion. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity.

         Mr MILES
        </emphasis>
        (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.04 a.m.)—I want to complete a speech which I was making to repudiate some comments made by Mr Best MHA in the Tasmanian parliament. I refer to three quotes by Mr Best in his speech. The first was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Mr de Haan, JP, who has had 25 years of loyal service to the school questioned whether Mr Miles had in fact pursued the funding. Mr de Haan was subsequently visited by the Federal Police at the request of Mr Miles.

        The second quote was:
       </para>

       </para>
       <para>
        And the third quote was:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Questions about financial problems and my role. `Why was Mr de Haan harassed?'
        <break page="8604" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        </break>
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to these claims by Mr Best, very little make sense and most are inaccurate or false. I respect Mr de Haan and I continue to respect him, but I find his attitude to women, the role of MPs intervening in legal proceedings and the threat of political action prior to the 1996 federal election authoritarian, demeaning, discriminatory, objectionable, unjust and ill&amp;hyphen;informed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 13 February 1995, Mr de Haan met with me at my Burnie office and requested in strong terms that I exert my influence over my wife and that it was my duty as a husband to persuade her to drop any legal action against the school. He told me that it was not a threat but that, if I did not intervene and stop the proceedings, he would organise political action with a group of men to undermine my credibility and standing in the community by organising a campaign of letter writing to both northern newspapers in Tasmania. I told him I would give the matter some thought.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 23 February I spoke to Mr de Haan by phone and informed him that I would not be intervening to stop legal action taken by Mrs Miles. I made my position quite clear. I do not believe members of parliament should use their position to intervene in legal proceedings. On 27 March my wife and I received an unsigned letter at our home address. That letter contained threats of action being taken against me as a member of parliament. The letter stated:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have been approached by a group of men, all parents of (Leighland) school. This group is planning to start inserting small articles under public opinion in two northern newspapers several times per week against you, Chris, as a politician, slowly building up an anti&amp;hyphen;Chris Miles feeling generally among the Braddon electorate. I am not in support of such action.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 23 April I wrote to Mr de Haan informing him that I would be placing the matter he spoke to me about on 13 February in the hands of the police.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 27 April I made a statutory declaration to the Tasmanian police at Burnie. In contradiction of Mr Best's claim, I have never believed the letter came from Mr de Haan. With respect to the letter from Mr de Haan, quoted by Mr Best, that letter was never
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         received at my office. Mr de Haan has never spoken to me about the funding submission to the federal government as indicated by Mr Best. Not only that, the police, according to Mr de Haan in the letter quoted by Mr Best, visited him on 24 April 1995, yet the school did not give me a copy of their submission until 14 months later on 1 July 1996. Perhaps Mr Best can explain how it is possible for him to claim harassment of Mr de Haan over his alleged questioning of financial matters that arose 14 months after the police had visited him with regard to an entirely different matter.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The attitude that Mr de Haan displayed when he spoke to me in my office was that he believed women were effectively the property of their husbands, and that they had to be subservient to their demands. That part of the school culture, as illustrated by the action and attitude of Mr de Haan with respect to women and their subservience to men, is to be regretted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mrs Miles is a university graduate with professional qualifications from Tasmania and New South Wales. She has taught in government schools in Tasmania, New South Wales, the ACT and at the Leighland School for 11 years, five years as vice&amp;hyphen;principal. Her rights as a professional teacher to take action should not be diminished because of her being married to a member of parliament.

        Sometimes standing strong for the principle of equality before the law, justice and a fair go for people in one's electorate is not always easy or straightforward. Neither do boards, which receive substantial money from government, take kindly to their budgets being found to be inaccurate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        This case is particularly complex but, no matter how difficult it is, the people of Braddon can be assured I will fight against mismanagement of funds in schools where taxpayers' money is involved, and I will fight for women and men who genuinely believe they have been unfairly treated.

        Of course, it was the minister who wrote to this woman in Townsville, not me. We happen to have a copy of the letter from the minister. It is the minister who talked about 56c, not me.

        This letter from the minister also refers to remarks that the Australian Confederation of Child Care made. They are saying to the government that families' child&amp;hyphen;care fees are going to go up as a result of the government's cuts. Of course, the Australian Confederation of Child Care is in no way associated or affiliated with the Labor Party. It has a much stronger small business representation and, of course, is very distressed by the hypocrisy and shallowness of this government in dealing with small businesses in this country.

        What we have seen is the minister not just bringing false allegations into this parliament but also misleading the public about what is going to happen to their child&amp;hyphen;care fees. The information she is using to say that their fees are only going to increase by 56c is, of course, false. She became carried away yesterday, trying to mislead the parliament, implying that the Labor Party and I were directly involved in the Townsville protest, which is clearly untrue.

        Even more important for South Australia in the 1996 budget was the announcement that $28 million will be devoted to the extension of the runway at Adelaide airport and also over $100 million will be devoted to the upgrade of the Mount Barker Road and the South Eastern Freeway, which is one of the northern boundaries of my electorate of Boothby.

        The extension of the Adelaide airport runway will allow fully laden jumbos to take off from Adelaide. The main runway will now be able to take aircraft right up to the B747, and that will provide Adelaide and South Australia with strong support for its regional tourism and export industries and will also allow South Australia to get its share of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         tourism and access to a greater range of high value commodity exports.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The extension of the runway at Adelaide airport will be a positive thing for South Australia. So you can imagine my surprise when I saw the pamphlet from the ALP candidate for the state seat of Peake, Mr Tom Koutsantonis, which essentially talks about and criticises the Liberal government's decision to extend the runway at Adelaide airport. It is old&amp;hyphen;style Labor knocking.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those members who do not know—and I notice the absence of the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who are the last vestiges of South Australian ALP in this House—the state electorate of Peake includes inner metropolitan suburbs such as Cowandilla, Torrensville, Thebarton, Lockleys and Brooklyn Park.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the ALP candidate for this seat must be lost, because he talks about the Tapleys Hill Road. Tapleys Hill Road actually goes through the blue&amp;hyphen;ribbon safe coastal state seat of Morphett. So I am wondering whether this candidate knows where the electorate is that he wants to represent. Also in the pamphlet, more critically—and this might indicate why he is lost—there is a photo of Tom Koutsantonis talking to local residents about the extension of the runway at Adelaide airport. It is a very interesting photo because in the photo there is a gentleman by the name of Justin Jarvis, there is someone called Leesa Chesser and there is also the daughter of Barry Piltz, a former ALP candidate for Grey.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Electoral Commission's latest rolls show Justin Jarvis as living in Glenelg North, in the blue&amp;hyphen;ribbon seaside electorate of Morphett. Leesa Chesser lives in West Lakes, an affluent area near Football Park. But, more critically, when you look at the Parliament House communications directory, you find that the Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate, Senator Dominic Foreman, has as an electorate officer Mr Justin Jarvis and as an electorate officer Miss Leesa Chesser. So the Labor candidate for a state seat has put out a pamphlet that is a sham. Rather than speaking with local residents of the electorate of Peake, he is talking with
        <break page="8608" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Labor apparatchiks—not just Labor apparatchiks, but staff, Labor Party hacks, who are working for a Labor Party senator. It is a sham; it is a disgrace.

        Two hundred years later, in South Australia, Jennifer Cashmore and John Olsen on 14 April 1989 first raised in the state parliament questions about the make&amp;hyphen;up of the loans balance sheet of the old State Bank of South Australia. On that day Mike Rann, the current Labor leader, got up and said that it was unpatriotic to question the State Bank of South Australia, that it was unpatriotic to raise any questions about the make&amp;hyphen;up of
        <break page="8609" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         loans in South Australia. I think someone once said that patriotism can be the refuge of scoundrels and patriotism can be expressed in different ways.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What you need to understand is that Mike Rann was a man who left the New Zealand of Piggy Muldoon to come to the utopian paradise of Don Dunstan's South Australia. So as a young kiwi university student he was attracted to that mirage in the desert, the utopian paradise of Don Dunstan. All I can say is that he should take that advice of that unknown convict to leave South Australia for the good of South Australian politics.

         —I rise tonight in response to comments made earlier in this place by members from the other side that figures published in the Australian candidate survey 1996 reflect members on this side of the House in a negative light. I advise members on the other side that I also participated in that survey. I was quite amazed when I heard some of the results members opposite were reflecting on, because on my reading of this document I certainly get a totally different point of view.

        Comments by honourable members on the other side prompted me to review some of the
        <break page="8612" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         statistics. The figures clearly show what a poor quality of representation voters could expect from those on the other side of the House. Of course, we are all quoting from the same book. I look first at the issue of pre-selection business associations. The question is asked as to what sorts of business associations candidates had. It is interesting to note that on our side 36.3 per cent of candidates had a very active business association, as opposed to 14 per cent on the other side. Given that government is one of the biggest businesses in the country, I find it amazing that there is so little ability with regards to business on that side of the House.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Another interesting statistic I found in the survey was in relation to commitment to organisations. The question is asked as to what sort of involvement respective candidates had with various community organisations. With regard to religious organisations, 23.2 per cent of our side were not active in religious organisations as opposed to 58.5 per cent of the other side. I thought that was rather interesting. Also, 78.4 per cent of the candidates on the other side were not at all active in other community organisations, such as hospital boards. In relation to school PTAs, 29.2 per cent of our side were not actively involved while 42.9 per cent of the other side were not involved. With regard to sporting clubs and organisations, 11.5 per cent of our side were not actively involved as opposed to 25.7 per cent from the other side. That shows once again who has the commitment with regard to community organisations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I found the issue of commitment to our constituents rather interesting. In relation to time devoted to party activities per month, it was interesting to see that 19.8 per cent of our side were actively involved for more than 20 hours. This compares with 24.8 per cent of the other side. When you look at the time spent dealing with constituents, you see that 59.1 per cent of our side spent more than 20 hours dealing with constituents as opposed to 51.2 per cent on the other side. Obviously, we are prepared to spend a lot more time—

         —Obviously the honourable member must have been sleeping at this late hour. It starts to get really interesting now because there was an interesting question here with regard to encouragement from trade unions. I found it quite amazing because the question was asked as to what sort of encouragement was given by trade unions or staff associations. It is interesting that on our side of the House 7.1 per cent of our candidates had very positive encouragement as opposed to 33 per cent on the other side of the House.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There was another question further on with regard to whether there should be stricter laws to regulate the activities of trade unions: 78.3 per cent of our side of the House agreed or strongly agreed that there should be stricter laws as opposed to 0.9 per cent on the other side. We had a debate here earlier with regard to pecuniary interests. I would suggest very strongly that it is rather hypocritical of that side of the House to start dealing with matters associated with the union movement when they have such a close tie and obviously were encouraged. In fact, there was another question on trade unions which asked if the trade unions had too much power. On our side of the House 89 per cent said yes, strongly agreed or agreed as opposed to 0.9 per cent on the other side of the House. They are very interesting statistics, I must say.

She gradually sat farther back as each division occurred today. First she sat up there in the first row, then it was the second row, then it was the third row. She ended up at the back and now she is not here; she is not even in the building because she simply will not defend her own actions. She has conceded defeat on this. She made serious allegations about suggestions that were supposed to be contained in a letter and we asked for that letter to be tabled, but of course the minister refused leave. She said it was confidential. It must have been a fabrication because we still have not seen it, in spite of the fact that now three speakers from this side have raised the minister's actions here. We still see the cone of silence there, the Marcel Marceau impersonation by the Minister for Family Services.

        Her big mistake, of course, was to support the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Fancy relying upon the member for Herbert for anything, because we all know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is a man who believes and said:

        More than 30 angry parents and industry workers crowded Mr Lindsay's office yesterday to hand him petitions carrying 1,110 signatures of concerned members of the community. Donning a black ribbon himself, Mr Lindsay told the crowd  the government was taking notice of their concerns and assured them he would deliver the petition to the family services minister in parliament next week.

        The member for Herbert, member of the government, wearing a black armband. That is his view of the Minister for Family Services's handling of the child&amp;hyphen;care issue. But he didn't kid the local child&amp;hyphen;care community. I wonder what their response was. The Andy Pandy Centre—and how appropriate—owner, Brian Couchman, said about the member for Herbert, `Wearing the black ribbon is just hypocritical of Peter Lindsay because he doesn't support our case one bit. He doesn't think it's a black day for child care; he thinks it's a good day for the government to save money.' In spite of the member for Herbert condemning and distancing himself by wearing a black armband at demonstrations against his own government, the minister took notice of him.

        We have the issue of Tracey, which has been raised by the shadow minister. Tracey is someone who, because of the government budget, is going to be $38 per week worse off. Tracey is a single mother in the member for Herbert's electorate. She did the right thing. She contacted her local member and she met with Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert. The member for Herbert said that he would take her issues up with the minister. Of course, the minister wrote back and we have here a letter from the minister to Tracey, the constituent concerned, saying that she would only be 56c worse off. But, of course, we know that is not true because the member for Herbert played a really interesting role.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The particular person, Tracey, works 38 hours a week, paid, but like lots of people who are keen to keep their job—and particularly so that she can pay to look after her young child—often works many more hours than that. However, because of the changes that the government brought forward, she can of course claim child care only for 50 hours a week rather than 60. So the member for Herbert suggested to the employer that he sign a document saying that she worked longer than 38 hours a week.

        This is a very, very sad day. Here we have serious allegations being put before this House about the Minister for Family Services and still we see the Minister for Family Services refusing to come in here. Of course, she has been pretty hopeless all year, and what we have seen is that for the first time this incompetent minister has got the smart look across her face and said, `Wait for it, here comes a big hit against the shadow minister to show I am not a total dope, to show I can get one thing right all year.' Then she moved away and since then has not opened her mouth. I would be interested in whether the member for Herbert will be following in this debate. I am sure every member on that side will stay seated so that the member for Herbert can defend himself and his actions of trying to politically use a single mother in that electorate who has been worse off to the tune of $38 per week as a result of this reactionary government's changes to child&amp;hyphen;care assistance.

         —The member for Cunningham wins the prize. Peter Costello said that in this House on 10 October l996. There is no real alternative but for the minister to come into this House and defend herself. First she started on the front bench, then she moved to the first row, then the second row, then the back row, now she is out the door. The cone of silence is still there, but the minister will not answer these questions. Perhaps because she has chosen to align herself with the member for Herbert, the person who believes that intelligence is this Darwinian thing that you get on the basis of your income, it really is up to the member for Herbert tonight, who will have 10 minutes to defend himself, to defend the Minister for Family Services and to defend the government's actions. But they have gone pretty quiet—have you noticed?—on that side. There were lots of points of order before, with lots of people standing up, but the fact is that, when it is put before you, you have ducked. This parliament is only going to sit for another hour or so and it really is incumbent upon the Minister for Family Services to come into this House and defend herself and her record, because she has not scored a hit all year. This is the best own goal since Andres Escobar, but we have banned guns now so that result will not happen. But the result that should happen is that she should go back onto the back bench.

        I represent a company in my electorate known as Pea and Grain Exporters. Pea and Grain Exporters have a factory based at Two Wells and they are not exporters in the simple agency terms; they are in fact processors directly involved in the value adding of a number of grain crops, principally pulses, oilseeds and, for the purpose of the debate tonight, pearl barley.

         Pea and Grain Exporters—clearly as the name implies—are exporters of this value added product. Pea and Grain Exporters have been endeavouring to get their grain products, particularly their pearl barley, into the European market and, in this instance, particularly into the Danish market. They came to me with what was a rather extraordinary problem that you would not expect a modern, efficient company to run into in Australia in 1996.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Pea and Grain Exporters have developed a new line of pearl barley and were in fact successfully marketing this in Denmark and found that the Danes were, in Pea and Grain Exporters' terms, `raising their farm subsidy to squeeze Pea and Grain Exporters out of the Danish market'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two of their buyers came to them and complained that in fact they had product coming to them from Danish producers that was undercutting the price that Pea and Grain Exporters could make this product available for in Denmark. So not unreasonably, they requested their two agents in Denmark to send them a sample of the competitor's product so that they could evaluate it and determine whether they could match it both in quality terms and in price terms. And that was when they ran into some difficulty.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The sample of pearl barley coming from Denmark to Australia left Denmark on 18 November and did not arrive in Australia until the 21st. That was marginally excusable, because the company responsible for transporting it, Sanford Couriers, ran into some difficulty with their computers and confessed that they had temporarily lost the consignment. Nonetheless, it arrived in Melbourne by 21 November and on 21 November it was delivered to AQIS. It was, of course, AQIS that had the responsibility of clearing this sample so that it could be determined as providing no threat to the Australian grain industry and could then be evaluated by Pea and Grain Exporters.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This is when the difficulty arose because it took AQIS from Thursday, 21 November until Thursday, 28 November to make this product available to my company, Pea and Grain Exporters. In fact, Pea and Grain Exporters were somewhat irritated because here they
         <break page="8616" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          were on the Thursday wanting to evaluate this product so that they could determine whether or not they could offer a competitive price.

         On the Friday, while the product was with AQIS, it still was not available, nor had it been, as far as they were concerned, released as a safe product so that Pea and Grain Exporters could evaluate it.

         In fact, by the Tuesday, they had lost the market to the two other competitors. On the Wednesday the product they had wanted out of AQIS still was not available and on the Thursday, too late for my processors to do anything about it, this competitor's product was made available to them to evaluate.

         I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) because, recognising that all is not well with AQIS and has not been well with AQIS for some time—including a good deal of time during which the present opposition were in government—he commissioned an inquiry into AQIS called the Nairn report which was released on Tuesday morning of this week. The Nairn

         I would do the government a disservice—indeed, I would do the parliament of Australia a disservice—if I were to imply that all was wrong with AQIS. Of course, it is clearly important that AQIS be recognised as the body that monitors both our exports and our imports. It is important that Australia's capacity to have a clean and green image is maintained by a watchdog called AQIS. But it is not good enough for AQIS to be in receipt of a product that needs rapid evaluation, take a week to evaluate it and in the process deny markets, not only to the company I represent, Pea and Grain Exporters, but to all the farmers who choose to supply that company.

         This leads to the whole question of the way in which we trade with Europe. The question of trade with Europe is very much determined by the arrangements that we have under GATT and the World Trade Organisation to produce a fairer trading environment than we have had in the past. Much of our trading environment is in the hands not only of those who set protection, not only of those who set tariff walls, not only of those who determine what the subsidies will be for European farmers, but also of AQIS, who determines what the standard of our imports will be. We need to recognise the important role that AQIS plays in maintaining Australia's clean and green image.

         There has been debate, frequently generated by the opposition, suggesting that the government should take action to prevent, if you please, the import of, for example, cooked chicken meat, New Zealand apples or even salmon. What the opposition needs to understand is that in trading terms the government does not have the opportunity to prevent the import of any one of those products. They must know that; they were the government only nine months ago.

         What the government has to do is carefully evaluate all of the product that is made available and determine whether or not it is safe to bring it into Australia. That is the obligation we have under the WTO; that is
         <break page="8617" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the obligation we inherited when the old GATT became the WTO. Frankly, the obligation that the government faces is the obligation of ensuring that our trade is not frustrated by artificial tariff walls or levels of protection; most of all, that we do not create quarantine barriers to trade but that we recognise that real scientific reasons, anything that puts the clean and green image of Australia at risk, are good and valid reasons to prevent trade. But if we simply think we can say no to trading arrangements, we will defy the arrangements and the obligations we already have under both the WTO and GATT.

         We cannot simply say no to trade. We need to evaluate whether or not the product coming into Australia puts Australian producers at risk. That is the obligation which the minister for primary industry has recognised. The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy recognised precisely the same obligation. The evaluation that is going on right now on cooked chicken meat and on apples and pears is not going on because the government wants to trade with those countries but because we cannot prevent that trade unless there are scientific reasons for doing so.

         Finally, can I say this: it is the fact that we are a signatory under the WTO that has allowed us to have access to other countries.

        This bill contains several important measures announced in the 1996 budget for the social security portfolio. In most cases, single people who share accommodation face lower costs through economies of scale, compared with the costs of living alone. The government has decided to set a new maximum rate of rent assistance for single people who share accommodation from 1 July 1997. The new maximum rate for single sharers will be two&amp;hyphen;thirds of the maximum rate for singles living independently. However, a number of groups will
        <break page="8620" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         be exempt from the new rate. These groups comprise the following:

        The second measure contained in the bill deals with the treatment of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds. Before March 1993, compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets were exempt from the social security income and assets test until age pension age. From March 1993, all superannuation benefits held in superannuation or rollover funds have been exempt from these tests until age pension age. This initiative involved estimated additional outlays of $4.1 million in 1992&amp;hyphen;93, increasing to $17.1 million in 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Given that superannuation savings are generally not subject to compulsory preservation after a person reaches the age of 55 and retires, people in these circumstances, including people who may not wish to retire but who have poor prospects of returning to work, can access their superannuation savings if they choose to do so. Consistent with the treatment of other savings, the government considers a person's superannuation savings should be taken into account in working out how much income support can be paid. Accordingly, from 20 September 1997, the assets test exemption of assets held in superannuation and rollover funds by social security pensioners and allowees under age pension age will be removed for people aged between 55 and age pension age after 39 weeks on income support since turning 55. For income test purposes, affected customers' superannuation and rollover assets will be added to their other financial assets and assessed under the extended deeming rules.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The anticipated savings from this measure are much greater than the estimated costs of the 1993 initiative. One reason why the latter
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         estimated costs are significantly smaller is that they reflected only the additional costs of exempting non&amp;hyphen;compulsorily preserved superannuation and rollover assets from social security assets and income tests until age pension age. However, a significant reason for the difference is the extent to which customers who are effectively retired, invested in superannuation and rollover funds as a means of avoiding the operation of the assets and income tests.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Neither the assets nor income test treatment of annuities and pensions, including allocated annuities and pensions, will change. These products will continue to be assessed under existing rules. This situation is, however, presently under review.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government is committed to ensuring that social security customers receive their rightful entitlement. At the same time, the government considers that the Australian taxpayer has a right to expect that the government will do all it can to minimise scope for overpayments. Overpayments often arise during holiday periods such as Easter when social security allowance payments are programmed in advance to be paid automatically on predetermined days that are earlier than usual if the customer's normal payday falls on a holiday. This can result in overpayments for the holiday period, some of which are not recoverable.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To that end, the third measure contained in the bill provides for a modified application form of certain social security and youth training allowances to be submitted before payment. The modified form will require a declaration of any changes anticipated for the remainder of the payment period. If any overpayments arise for the payment period, they will be recoverable. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

         —Given the extreme lateness of the hour, I intend to be extremely succinct. This legislation originated in the Senate and was extensively debated there. We take strong exception to two of the measures. One is the
         <break page="8729" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          measure about rent assistance to sharers. We believe that the fundamental rationale for that is flawed. If you look at the structure of rent assistance and the way it is determined, you will see there is a minimum amount of rent that has to be paid—a threshold—before you can receive any assistance. Above that threshold, three&amp;hyphen;quarters of what you pay by way of rent is then paid to you in the form of rent assistance, subject to a ceiling.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Given that and the way the mechanism works, we believe that people who are sharing accommodation, if they want to achieve economies, will be obviously paying less rent each. So, under the way the system works, they will receive less rental assistance. In order to get the higher rates of assistance, you actually have to be paying an amount of rent in excess of that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We think this is a pretty onerous measure that is going to have a significantly adverse effect on some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. There is a range of people who, for a variety of reasons, find it necessary to share accommodation in inner city areas and who, in order to gain access to work opportunities, have to live in high rent areas; and share accommodation might be the only option available. I gather that there are some 80,000 people who are going to be quite adversely affected by this measure, and we strongly oppose it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other measure we are opposing is the removal of the exemption from the social security means test of superannuation and rollover benefits. Again, this measure is going to slug some of the most disadvantaged in our society, particularly the older unemployed people over the age of 55. In some cases, they are going to find themselves in the situation of having to access their superannuation assets in order to have a decent amount to live on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We think that compromises fundamentally—in a significant way—the objective the former government had of promoting the expansion of superannuation. If superannuation is going to be expanded and consolidated in the way that we intended, people have to have a sense of security about the provisions
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         that will relate to it. Obviously this is utterly detrimental to that.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also note that if people are to be expected to access their superannuation benefits, there are certain conditions and requirements associated with that. In particular, I understand the superannuation industry regulations would require somebody seeking to access their superannuation benefits to more or less indicate an intention to permanently retire from the work force. We do not think that makes a great deal of sense at all. Given the ageing of the population, we want to be fostering and encouraging older people who become unemployed to seek to re&amp;hyphen;enter the work force and to gain employment, so we think this is quite counterproductive.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We also think it is an example of a measure which is supposed to be contributing to national savings by a reduction in budget outlays during the forward estimates. But if you take a somewhat longer view of it, obviously to the extent that people's superannuation benefits are eroded, their capacity to provide for themselves once they do reach pensionable age is diminished and, as a consequence of that, pension outlays are going to be higher than they otherwise would have been.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation have looked at this measure in some detail. They make a number of points, including the ones I have just made, but they also point out that there has been very little in the way of modelling done to see what the longer term impact of this measure is going to be on national savings. For a variety of reasons, we see these measures as highly retrograde, highly obnoxious and inequitable. We are opposed to them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When we get to the consideration in detail stage I will be moving an amendment more or less along the lines of the recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which seeks to limit the application of this measure to sums in excess of $250,000 and to make it completely prospective—that is to say, it would apply only to superannuation moneys invested after the date of the budget announcement. We are moving that amendment to schedule 1 and we will also be
        <break page="8730" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         opposing schedule 2, which gives effect to the rent assistance measure. That, in essence, is what we will be doing and, as I said, given the lateness of the hour, I do not intend to say any more than that.

         —I am pleased to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Further Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 to place a number of matters on the record and to reacquaint the House with some of the measures contained within it. It is very fair to say from the outset—particularly after the contribution from the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin)—no&amp;hyphen;one on this side of the House ever wants to see any Australian, particularly those who are less well off, denied access to assistance, any Australian denied access to equality of opportunity or any Australian denied the chance to get on and do better for themselves. But it is also very important to note, in the context of this bill especially, the previous government, through 13 years of their quite bizarre approach to welfare, created not a safety net but rather a hammock for so many Australians.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The laws we are considering in these matters before us this morning are one which cost us more and more money as a country each year. This government is placed in a position where it has to look at measures to try to peel back some of the growing cost on a yearly basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to get to the heart of the way the previous government created so many complex laws in an area like social security. I submit one of the great differences between the Liberal and National parties and the Australian Labor Party is, while this side of the House believes most people will do the right thing and will frame laws and regulations to punish those who do the wrong thing, those on the other side have a philosophical bent which says essentially most people will always do the wrong thing so let us punish everyone just in case.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As a result, Labor come up with complex laws, red tape, paperwork and all sorts of things which frighten average Australians when they confront them. One of the real issues which brought about the end of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         previous government on 2 March was exactly to do with this. Particularly older Australians found red tape and paperwork changing on an almost monthly basis, and those sorts of changes frighten people. It is quite fair for older Australians to want a sense of certainty. They want a sense of understanding what they did last year is what they are going to do this year. Yet, through 13 years of changes, we found more and more older Australians getting more and more frightened—and they spoke very loudly on 2 March.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are also families in Australia who have been hurt by this complex red tape and this desire to punish everyone just in case. I remember a few years ago my wage structure was sufficiently small we were able to access government assistance to subsidise my daughter's attendance at child care. On one occasion my wife said to me, `Can you ring the DSS at Upper Mount Gravatt because a cheque hasn't come through?' I rang them and I was instantly the victim of a thousand plagues because they were not going to speak to me: `You're only the father. We'll only speak to your wife if she's really still your wife, if you're still together.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Again, you have a situation where I get punished for making a perfectly sensible approach in assisting my wife. My wife gets punished because she has to then find some time, which was of great inconvenience to her that day, to spend, as I did, 25 or 30 minutes on the phone waiting to speak to somebody at the DSS.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think it is very important to put in context any attempts by those opposite to add any of the measures in this bill to their ongoing attempts to scare different groups in the community—scare older Australians about nursing homes, scare parents about child care and scare people about matters contained in this bill. I understand a number of changes have come back from the Senate and the government seems fairly happy about those changes. The minister has moved the amended bill accordingly. On this basis, despite the fact the opposition are going to move further amendments in the consideration in detail stage of this bill, we will be able to get through this bill fairly fast. Given the lateness
        <break page="8623" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         of the hour, I am sure everyone will agree with this.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But I guess it is important to state for the record the number of measures which are contained in this bill. The measures were announced by the government prior to the election some 10 months ago and are in keeping with the government's program announced in the August budget. The bill is all about keeping our promises. It is about keeping faith with all of the people who elected this government—the majority of Australian voters.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The majority of Australia has called for changes to tighten up our social security system and reduce the rorts to ensure taxpayers' dollars are used to help the needy rather than the dishonest. They want the dishonest punished, not the average Australians, and they are the sorts of calls Labor ignored for 13 years. As I said, our social security system was never meant to be the hammock it has become. Yet this is how so many people in this country now see it. For the rest of us, it is still a safety net and it continues to be one of the most generous in the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not have any problem in commending any of the steps in this bill. I believe it will take those necessary steps to restore integrity and fairness to our social security system. We are doing the right thing. I am certain most people also feel the same way. We talked about it up&amp;hyphen;front. We are doing what we said we were going to do and we are doing what is needed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have to change some things around so the honest majority do not suffer because of the actions of a dishonest few. This is what has been happening ever increasingly in this country over the past decade or so. The result was more paperwork, more red tape and more taxes, more Big Brother intrusions into people's lives. Quite frankly, I do not believe it needs to be like this. I do not think anybody ever really wants it to be like this.

         which is pretty clear. It says that those who are going to go off benefit should go to relief agencies. But if you look at the explanatory memorandum which goes to the extent of the savings that these measures put through, if you look at schedule 1, which is the amendments to remove the means test exemption for superannuation assets in certain cases, you see that the first full year effect is in 1997&amp;hyphen;98—a $92 million saving. So we are talking about a considerable amount. The thing that concerns me about these measures is that it is really soft targets that we always home in on.

My frustration is—these remarks not only go to the present government but go to previous governments; not only the previous Labor government but the Liberal&amp;hyphen;National Party government before that—that, whilst governments talk about trying to put a cap on executive salaries, we always fail. We have never found a solution. We are not willing to go the full road to put in place legislation that might tackle that. One piece of legislation I would suggest is the American model. They have capped the level of executive salaries that can be counted for taxation purposes as a cost of production.

For the brevity of this debate, the opposition has grave concerns about the way in which these amendments to the social security legislation are being put before us, especially in the context of the attitude of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, which seems to be, `Oh, don't worry.

        The amendments that have been foreshadowed by the opposition spokesman basically remove this piece of legislation for the next 15 to 20 years. They are saying that any money put into superannuation after the budget measure in August will be all that will be taken into account and that it will not matter until $250,000 has actually gone into that account. Therefore, it really is a pointless amendment. It pushes this out for a minimum of 15 years, and perhaps more like 25 years for most people. Therefore, I strongly suggest that we reject that out of hand.

I draw attention to the implications of the changes for particularly men aged over 55, who really are suffering considerably from what can only be described as a downsizing epidemic that is now sweeping Australia. I will read a letter I received from a constituent of mine, which I think really sums up the problems that are

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Having been made redundant at the age of 61 and desperately trying to secure work since, I think it is intolerable that this government should be able to change the rules mid stream. I did not expect to be penalised. By the time I am 65 years of age, a large amount of my rollover funds will be used up. I therefore hope you can discuss this outrageous decision by the government in parliament and have the intended new laws rescinded.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is exactly the problem that is going to apply to people in this age group. They will not be helped back into the work force, which is obviously the desire of many of them. There are a couple of other points that I think are very serious, particularly for those who leave the work force to care full time for disabled or frail elderly relatives. At present, these people are entitled to the carer pension until they reach age pension age. As a result of this measure, carers with superannuation are going to be unable to claim the carer pension until they have run down these assets.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What I fear is that this is going to be a major disincentive for people to take on caring responsibilities. I think the government is being rather short&amp;hyphen;sighted in trying to save $173.20 a week, which is the single rate for the carer pension. If a person has to go into a nursing home, the cost to the government associated with that is $714 per week. As far as carers are concerned, it is a very short&amp;hyphen;sighted measure and, I would have to say, I think a very callous and surprising one because this government has, other than this measure, been very supportive of carers.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The government also says that half of the individuals that are going to be affected by this measure are going to be those on disability support pensions. We would all know that these people are not wealthy people because their working lives have been affected by disability or illness. As a result of that, their superannuation savings are likely to be relatively modest. If they are going to be forced to deplete these superannuation savings
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         between the ages of 55 and 65, once they get to age pension age they will have to go on the age pension because their superannuation will be used up. This is a very short&amp;hyphen;term measure. The government is really just trying to find another place to make savings. This measure is not going to add to the bulk of national savings and I think the decision should be reversed.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as rent assistance is concerned, there really are some very serious implications for those renting and sharing accommodation. These are generally people who are the most disadvantaged in our community. A large proportion of them are young people, many of them between the ages of 15 and 19. The figure is 65 per cent, in fact. I give that figure for those opposite who might like to know how many young people of that age are actually sharing accommodation. These get lower social security benefits than everybody else and they will be very seriously affected by this change.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The same applies to a considerable number of elderly people who do not own their own homes and are totally dependent on the age pension. These are very disadvantaged people in our community. They are often sharing with other elderly people in similar circumstances. This is a substantial cut that is going to dramatically affect their standard of living. These are very callous moves. I thought it was important, even at this late hour, to make these remarks.

        Working people who have planned through their working lives for a secure retirement will feel cheated by this coalition government's decision to force them to access their superannuation payments prior to reaching retirement age. People who started work, say, 40 years ago had an expectation that, barring ill health, they would be able to work through until they had reached retirement age. For many workers, this dream has not come true due, as the member for Jagajaga said, to the culture of industrial downsizing. Many people have been forced out of the work force long before they have been in the financial position to be. Many people in this age group want to continue to work; however, due to employment conditions, illness and disability, they are unable to do so. Rather than preserving their superannuation entitlements until they have reached 65 years of age, they will be required to draw on this money to replace lost income.

        This applies to workers who are 55 years of age or over. Fifty&amp;hyphen;five seems to be the age that a lot of employers think it is a good idea to ease older workers out of the work force.

        I won't add to what I said in the second reading debate. This particular set of amendments gives effect to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and seeks to restrict the operation of this measure to some superannuation assets and rollover assets in excess of $250,000 and to make it purely prospective. An amendment in this form was also moved in the Senate. I might indicate that we will divide on this. We obviously oppose schedules 1 and 2, but there will only be the one division, on this particular motion.

        The government is supporting the amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 proposed by the Australian Democrats. The Democrats and the government have reached agreement on a package of measures which will ensure there are adequate safeguards for new doctors who could potentially be affected by the bill. The key amendments proposed are for a new section 3(g)(c) which provides for the establishment of a medical training review panel, amendments to new section 19AA so as to effectively introduce a sunset clause and new section 19AD that will require the minister to report to parliament by the year 2000 on the operation of the new section of the legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendments establish a Medical Training Review Panel and it is a sensible addition which strengthens the legislation. The panel
        <break page="8630" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         will incorporate functions monitoring the numbers and types of training positions and also establish the register of medical opportunity. This register will provide not only a great avenue for graduates to sell their skills across the country but for hospitals, colleges and other employers to advertise their vacancies.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This should result in a better match of graduates to positions, getting people to where the jobs are. The data generated from this panel in reports to the minister and to the parliament will enable us to get a better picture of the medical work force in Australia. We have also agreed to the addition of a sunset clause. However, the government expects the experience of the legislation will lead to the parliament agreeing to the measures being retained beyond 1 January 2002. I commend the amendments to the House.

I would just like to once again reaffirm the opposition's concerns about the measures that are contained in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2). We acknowledge the success of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in having the legislation passed and the success of his advisers and departmental officers who have provided advice to the government on this issue.

        Naturally the reason we remain opposed is we still have genuine concerns about the impact that the measures may have. We have explained them to this House and the other chamber in the past, so I will not go through them again tonight. I simply make the point that while we welcome the safety net which the minister has negotiated with the Democrats—any safety net is better than no safety net—we think that the fact that the minister has agreed to a safety net is at least a belated admission that there is potential for a problem to exist for some of those young doctors in training.

         To those medical students and interns who have sought over a number of months to persuade the government to head in a different direction, I simply say that I have appreci ated very much the many opportunities they have taken to let me and my colleagues know their concerns about this measure. I am sure the minister expects that they may yet be persuaded that his legislation is worthy of support. I would hope that, if concerns do arise—irrespective of the fact that the minister has had his way in the parliament—and the difficulties are greater than he expects he will at least try to keep an open mind with new issues that may develop in future months.

          —There are a number of problems with the small business sector that have to be addressed, most notably fair trading and business conduct. It is worth pointing out that this government has already established an inquiry into these areas through the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. A lot of small businesses are not adequately protected against harsh and oppressive conduct in their dealings with larger companies. I encourage this inquiry to get to the bottom of some of these issues and put in place a code of conduct that stops these unsavoury practices from happening and legislates to penalise those people and organisations which seek to take unfair advantage of the small businessperson.

         I have a constituent in my electorate who has experienced this type of oppressive practice and harsh, unconscionable and deceptive conduct. In 1988 a Mr Sid O'Toole investigated going into business with Berklee, the muffler and exhaust operation. Mr O'Toole was told by Berklee management
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          that they were experienced franchisors of 25 years standing and already had 120 franchised stores across the country. Mr O'Toole looked at one of the stores in Rockhampton, Queensland, which he was advised was the most successful store in Australia and was yet to be converted into a franchise system.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Management outlined the commitment Berklee Retail was prepared to provide to franchisees and these included: a 50 per cent royalty to be paid by franchisees to be used for advertising, promotion and marketing, demographic surveys, store assistance and training; and 50 per cent of advertising funds paid by franchisees would be used in their immediate locality. Berklee Retail promised franchisees exclusive rights to distribute their product. Some 18 months later, confirming what Mr O'Toole had been told, Berklee Retail produced a franchise promotion booklet entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Berklee way: making money
         </emphasis>
         and in March 1990 produced a company video. The booklet and the video state that over 100 Berklee Australia exhaust centres operate across the nation. It goes on to say what franchising involves and how it operates. It also states in the booklet how the 50 per cent of royalty payments will be spent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Effectively, both the booklet and the video promoted the same information that management had told Mr O'Toole and all other franchisees and potential franchisees which, in Mr O'Toole's case, convinced him to sign up with Berklee Retail and purchase the Rockhampton business.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As it turned out, the company failed to meet any of these commitments and promises. It is now evident that Berklee Retail, under the auspices of Berklee Ltd, deceived and induced people through its management and its promotional literature to become franchisees. Berklee Retail was not an experienced franchisor and had only 25 franchise stores at the time Mr O'Toole bought into the Rockhampton franchise.

         Of the royalty paid by franchisees, 50 per cent of their commitment was to be used in advertising locally. This never happened. The only advertising was corporate which concentrated on television at a massive cost and none of it was directed at the franchisee's specific market areas.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Although promised time and time again, there was no in&amp;hyphen;store training by competent staff employed by Berklee Retail. There was no backup and support for franchisees, or proper financial profile of a model store and a demographic report based upon the franchise agreement. Berklee Retail also failed to make full and accurate written disclosure of all the information considered relevant to the franchise relationship at least seven days prior to the execution of the franchise agreement, or at all, and they failed to provide information as to how royalty and advertising money was actually being spent. The franchisor accepted payment of moneys for goods and services it did not intend to supply to its franchisees. This seriously contravenes the provisions of section 58 of the Trade Practices Act.

        <para first-indent="16">
         By 1991 it was apparent that a number of Berklee franchisees had the same problems, so a group of them, including Mr O'Toole, formed the Berklee Franchisee Association in an attempt to reconcile the many financial and procedural problems in the system. They had to do this because there were no grievance solving procedures in place. Berklee got wind of this and set out to destroy the six franchisees involved. There were threats and intimidation and as a last resort they began to smash into shops in the dead of night with security guards to force the franchisees out. This action was outside the law and in one instance the matter went to court and the judge clearly ruled in favour of the franchisee

         The franchisees took their case to the Motor Trades Association on 11 March 1992.

Such a breach of duty and dishonest behaviour are clearly unacceptable and un&amp;hyphen;Australian and Berklee Ltd must be vigorously pursued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities Commission so that, if appropriate, criminal and corporate charges can be laid.

         The aggressive campaigns by state governments and/or their agencies around Australia to encourage and entice people into gambling are destroying families. These are people who can ill afford to spend scarce family incomes on Lotto, instant lotteries, jackpot lotteries and all the derivatives that flow from them. They spend those scarce family dollars on gambling games that offer infinitesimally low chances of getting any kind of return for their money. Their entry into one form of gambling beyond their means opens the door to the slippery slide into other forms of gambling.

         edition of 9 June 1996. Australians spend $61 billion on gambling each year, which is twice the total expenditure on health. Poker and gaming machine turnover is $38 billion, racing takes $11 billion, lotteries $3 billion and casinos and others $8 billion. While so many unfortunate people become addicted to gambling as a result of government actions, so the government themselves have become addicted to gambling as a principal source of revenue.

One aspect I find so offensive and so dishonest is the blatantly false expectations of winning that are portrayed in TV advertisements of lotto. These slick `sizzle not the steak' commercials seek to have people believe that almost all one has to do is buy a ticket and collect the first prize. It is not too harsh to say that the ads aim to part people from their money in the expectation that they too can so easily enjoy the pleasure, the excitement and the security that sudden wealth could bring them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The tragedy is so many people fall for the con of the ads and are parted from their money which they really need for family living. So often when people begin to overreach it leads on to more gambling, more losses and more despair. The reality is that the prospects of winning are so low that they are never publicised to potential purchasers. But what are the odds of winning? In the Powerball lottery the odds of winning the first prize are one in 25 million. In the $2 jackpot lottery the odds of winning are one in 9&amp;half; million. For the $5 jackpot lottery the odds are one in 4&amp;half; million. For Ozlotto the odds of winning first prize are one in eight million and for lotto the chance of winning first prize is one in seven million. The advertising used to promote these gambles is dishonest and misleading. It leads people who cannot afford it to spend family income on gambling. The truth is that the government is extracting increasing taxes from families without regard to family needs.

        <para first-indent="16">
         What is even worse is that one form of gambling leads on to another and another and another and then despair. The diversion of family incomes to gambling has been identified in Victoria since the opening of the Crown Casino. The major shopping centre proprietors point to the casino as the reason for reduced turnover in their premises. The Victorian Retail Traders Association blames the rise in gambling in that state for the fall in retail turnover in that state. The combination of alcohol, gaming machines, EFTPOS and automatic telling machines is a dangerous environment for other than the perennially

         Mr Paul Symonds of the New South Wales Council on Problem Gambling has made the point that with gambling there is literally no limit to the amount of money that can be spent. He says also that somewhere between one&amp;hyphen;half and seven per cent of the adult population gamble. In Sydney that means something like 30,000 to 40,000 people, each of whom affects the livelihood of another 10 to 15 people.

         Clearly, a substantial number of families are damaged by the ravages of gambling, be it machines, racing, casinos, lotteries or other games of chance.

         I want to see honesty of purpose from governments in relation to gambling. I want to see honesty in practice from governments in relation to gambling. Just as excessive smoking is recognised as a damaging social practice and addictive, so excessive gambling should be recognised as a damaging social practice and addictive. Just as advertisements for cigarettes are required to carry a warning of the risks involved, so should advertisements for gambling—both government related and from the private sector—carry warning of the risks involved. The advertisements should state the chances of winning the major and minor prizes. They should state the percentage of the purchase price or investment that will be taken by the government. This is the least that those governments should have to do to have some modicum of honesty in relation to tax by gambling. Finally, Mr Speaker, they must do much more to assist those persons who have become addicted to gambling than the minuscule help being provided currently.

I would like at the outset to express my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of both the Monarch and the Seaview Air crashes.

         I welcome the response by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) to Commissioner Staunton's Seaview Air report and, more latterly, to the

         The Seaview Air report is an exhaustive report. It was a very expensive report. It was spread out over a long period.

         On 27 June in this chamber and in the main chamber on 27 June, I expressed my grave concerns about events related to aviation safety in this country, the direction in which the government was heading, and some of the statements being made by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I have expressed those views to him privately. What I am saying now is not something that I have not expressed to him directly or in this place or in the other place on earlier occasions.

         The work that was done by the commission of inquiry did pick up the work that was carried out by the inquiry. It was a good example of the two activities working together to minimise expense to the taxpayer and to draw on the information, not duplicating the process that was well under way.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The work that was done by Commissioner Staunton, as I said, is exhaustive. But, looking back through it, the question is what the problem was with the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was then known. More latterly, there has been an attempt to ascribe it to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and—as the reference is in here—to the timidity of the Civil Aviation Authority at the time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The problems of that timidity and the lack of will in enforcing its responsibilities are rooted in the dramatic and utterly inappropriate change in philosophy and direction of the Civil Aviation Authority brought about by the Chairman, Dick Smith, and the Chief Executive Officer, Frank Baldwin, in 1991. That change in philosophy represented the aviation industry as a customer.

          The early report that came forward dealing with the same subject was a coronial inquiry into the Monarch air disaster. I will quote from this document and from a number of other documents in the time I have this morning, just to get these statements together in the one place, on the record, and in the parliament.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          In the case of the Monarch, on page 8 of the report the coroner said:
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
          A former chairman of the CAA had advocated a policy of "affordable safety" which favoured a very lenient approach to policing the regulations. "Affordable safety" does not necessarily equate to "necessary safety"; in effect, it was up to each airline to decide if it was affordable to fly safely. If a plane crashes, the airline is up for the cost of the plane; if the passengers and pilots are killed or injured and the airline has no assets or insurance to cover that contingency then the risk is "affordable" to the airline.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
          The CAA's motto was "a safe and viable industry" but the senior echelons of the CAA placed undue emphasis on promoting a "viable" industry and, as a consequence, were loath to prosecute airlines for breaches of the Regulations or to revoke an AOC and this had the effect on the Airworthiness and Flight Operations Branches which were responsible for policing the Regulations. Internal memos passing between inspectors show they resented the restrictions imposed on them by their superiors . . . The effect of all this was that inspectors were unable to take any action against airlines for breaches of the regulations apart from giving warnings and so&amp;hyphen;called counselling.
         </para>
         <para>
         </para>
         <para>
          That is the underpinning. This is where it all began, in that change in philosophy, that change in culture concerning the regulator's role. The primary consideration of the people that are there to ensure that airlines and air services are operated safely was the financial viability of the operator.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Now let me turn to Commissioner Staunton's report. On page 92 of his report, the section dealing with the industry as a customer, pararaph 3.16, it says:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2">
          Accompanying these changes were subtle, and not&amp;hyphen;so&amp;hyphen;subtle, changes of philosophy. The Chairman, Mr Smith, made the following comments in the annual report for 1989&amp;hyphen;90:
         </para>
         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16" right-indent="16">
          `The CAA's future is inextricably linked to the future of the aviation industry . . . It follows that what is good for the aviation industry—high safety, lower costs, more aircraft in the air, few delays, more people flying—is also good for the CAA.'
         </para>
         <para>
          Further, in paragraph 3.17, referring to the review of resources, it says that CAA's core values include being customer orientated. Then we go over to paragraph 3.21. Again, I am quoting directly from Staunton's report on CAA strategies designed to reduce the cost of aviation services to industry, which include:

         <para>
          It goes on as I move through the report, 3.9, 3.20, then these words of Commissioner Staunton contain a steely message clothed in cotton wool, and I ask members of the parliament to look a little bit more deeply behind what Staunton was really saying. For the sake of propriety, the words are carefully couched, gently. In 3.30 it says:

          Mr Dick Smith ceased to be Chairman of the CAA in February 1992. Mr Baldwin resigned as Chief Executive Officer in February 1993. Nonetheless, the concept of the industry as the customer of the CAA remained, at least for some time. In a memorandum that achieved some notoriety, Mr Cannane, then the Airworthiness Manager of the Bankstown District Office, directed his officers in these terms:

          Staunton says:

         <para font-size="-=2">
          Mr Cannane did not mince words. He said this:

          And so it goes on in this letter:

         <para font-size="-=2" left-indent="16" right-indent="16">
          `Improve your salesmanship. This means that you will be a servant to our customer, the Industry, that you serve and monitor.

Anyone acting like a bureaucrat is not performing their duty in a manner acceptable to this management and will not be tolerated.'
         </para>
         <para>
          These quotes are from a memo sent round from on high, and these are the officers at the coalface trying to ensure that aircraft are airworthy, aircrew are properly qualified and all the things that need to be done to ensure safe air transport are done. Here is the fundamental conflict: that they are our customers—service and regulatory—and that if we do not have customers then we do not have jobs. To me, that is like a policeman going on the street and saying, `Well, if we don't have any burglars, I'm out of a job. We've got to have burglars, otherwise I don't have a job, so we'll catch some but we'll leave others there to keep us all in employment.' It would be ludicrous if it were not so serious.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          These are the roots of the problem within the Civil Aviation Authority at that time; that confusion of roles, the contradiction in messages and culture coming down from the board itself. That flowed on to intimidation of staff, and the staff themselves being afraid to carry out their responsibilities. As I move through it, I keep coming back to the problem that the emphasis is upon general aviation, charter operators, recreational flyers, when the reality in this country is that, when we look to the carriage of domestic passengers in 1995&amp;hyphen;96 that were carried by the major airlines and the regional airlines, 27.7 million people travelled by air in 1995&amp;hyphen;96.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If we take into that the international passengers who arrived in Australian airspace and transited in Australian airports, there are a further 12.1 million people. So, overall, there are 40 million people travelling by air in a year in Australia, and there is no reference in any of this stuff to them. All the noise we hear and all the hoo&amp;hyphen;ha we have going on is about the recreational flyers, the weekend warriors. All we hear is whether Mr Smith should be chairman, and whether the board should have somebody on it who has had aviation experience.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I do not want to repeat all of the words that I have used before on this issue. But, I am pleased to see that the minister is now picking up the recommendations, both of Commissioner Staunton and of the

          report. Undoubtedly, he had a major role in that, along with myself as chair. That was a job that was done to improve safety for everybody. It is a contradiction when the minister in his statement in respect of the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          report said:

         <para>
          True. But we ought to be concentrating on ensuring that they are performing their task to the required standards of safety and not obsessing ourselves with what happens at the lower end of the market. Most of the activity there is private recreational, self activity, not the 40 million people who use aviation services each year—domestic, regional and international.

          <para first-indent="16">
           So, this incongruent approach where we hear a tremendous amount of noise from the small players and absolute silence from Ansett, Qantas, and the Board of International Airlines—they represent all of the international airlines operating into this country. In this committee this morning, I call upon Ansett, Qantas, the Regional Airlines Association, and the Board of International Airlines representatives to take up their responsibility and to play a more overt and effective role in respect of aviation safety in this country. What we have had is the tip of the tail wagging the dog, and some personality relationships.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           You cannot have people going around the aviation industry saying, `Dick Smith is  wonderful bloke. He raised $6 million for the government's election campaign.' That is what is on the grapevine. I do not know whether it is true. They are the figures that I have been told. Great bloke. I am not concerned whether he is a great bloke. What I am concerned about are the 40 million people who are entitled to a proper standard of aviation safety when they use the aviation services of this country. It is not good enough for the major carriers to sit mute and have this image peddled across to the Australian public that their interests are not being protected. If they are not being protected, then it is time that Ansett, Qantas, the Board of International Airlines representatives, and the Regional Airlines Association started to speak out and express their concerns and their priorities.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           So, the committees that have been formed, the measures that are being implemented now, the random checks on stocks of parts to ensure that bogus parts are not in the system and are not being utilised in aircraft, the random checks in respect of charter operators, are all steps in the right direction. I am appealing to the minister this morning to put aside his obsession with the members of the board and to concentrate on lifting the morale of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority itself. You cannot have confidence and pride in what you do, when your boss is kicking you in the guts all the time anonymously.

           The briefing that we had yesterday—and I notice the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro&amp;hyphen;economic Reform has now joined us—from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority does give one hope and heart for improvement. I thought that it was professional, but it recognises the history of the problems, too, and the fact that they are now pulling together and rebuilding. The principles are under way to work together with those in the industry who accept their safety responsibility. `Who accept their safety responsibility' are the critical words in that. There must be a vigorous pursuit of those who choose not to operate in compliance, and the adoption of a safety system assessment as a base of regulatory approach.

          Perhaps too the blame must rest with those who conceived the so&amp;hyphen;called review of resources within the CAA which saw an exodus of some of the organisation's best and brightest. The review of resources will forever stand as an example of how not to trim a corpulent organisation, of retaining too much chaff and too little wheat. Much is made of the fact that Dick Smith was Chairman of the CAA during the review of resources period. It is suggested that Mr Smith's embrace of the notion of affordable safety contributed to laxity which led to the Monarch and Seaview tragedies. Does this make Mr Smith a scapegoat? Probably. Mr Smith cannot walk away from his chairmanship of the CAA blameless but nor should he be pilloried for policies which were endorsed by the government of the day and which clearly were actively pursued by other members of the CAA board.

          Australia has had an excellent record for air safety and, as has been said by previous speakers, there are a large number of passenger movements in this country—approximately 40 million per year international and domestic. This calls therefore for the highest degree of circumspection and regulation in order that the safety of those people is paramount in the eyes of the regulators of air safety. In other words, well may the standards be kept high. There is an extremely high onus on government to ensure absolute safety and imbue absolute confidence in the travelling public.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Because of the large number of people who are travelling, the large number of movements and its importance on the overall Australian economy, it would seem indeed not so much importance but it is a fact of life that all of us from time to time need to travel. Particularly in commercial and cargo movements, it is almost without question, I would have thought, that we need to ensure the safest airline system, the safest system of managing and assisting aircraft movements that we can possibly have. There really is no argument in my view for trimming air safety. We must have absolute confidence in the safety of our airlines.

          It is clear that the inquiry into the Seaview disaster revealed a number of disturbing elements, in particular, the fact that the flight in question was overloaded by something of the order, on one view—the view most favourable to Seaview—of 220 kilograms and, at the other end of scale, 288 kilograms. That is substantial overloading having regard to the size of the aircraft and the number of passengers on board.

          The pilot's licence was not valid. There were unsatisfactory work practices adopted by the airline, including understating of hours to avoid fatigue regulations, overstating of hours to inflate pilot experience and to earn the pilot a licence in a different category sooner than he or she would otherwise be able to, and subtle pressure on the employees of the airline to flout regulations, that subtle pressure coming from the management. But even more disturbing, in my view, has been the role of the CAA which, in a sense, reminds me of Mount Erebus revisited.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have had the opportunity to read the book by Mr Justice Mahon who, you might remember, was the commissioner who investigated the Erebus disaster. His report was not accepted by the New Zealand government. Indeed, a monumental exercise in government thuggery occurred at that time in an attempt to try to water down the strong criticism of Air New Zealand by Mr Justice Mahon, and the criticism of the senior bureaucrats from Air New Zealand and other people involved in safety who came before his commission. I wish I could remember his famous phrase describing that evidence—I have used it in court a few times myself. It really emphasised how disturbing it was that these bureaucrats could get together and cover up, and attempt to do a snow job, as they say. And it appears that this has occurred in relation to the CAA here.

           There was an attempt—and a successful attempt, it would seem—on the part of some bureaucrats to snow the former board. Indeed, it seems that that may have been carried over to the new board. I was particularly concerned in relation to one of the so&amp;hyphen;called whistleblowers, Mr Bob Hoy, who was the district airworthiness manager at Coffs Harbour. He urged suspension of the company's air operators certificate. This occurred in the year of the tragedy, on 13 January 1994. Then on 16 April he went to Canberra to see the then chief executive of the CAA, Mr Doug Roser, to press his concern. Yet these warnings were ignored. Mr Hoy was doing not only what he was paid to do but what was expected of him. He was insisting on standards, on compliance with safety regulations, yet he was perceived by his superiors to be out of step and was subsequently persecuted—hence I say the revisiting of the Erebus situation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           That sort of behaviour is totally unacceptable, in my view, in looking at the question of air safety. We cannot be too diligent. We cannot be too prescriptive. We cannot be too bureaucratic in many respects in regulating air safety because lives are at stake. There are no second chances, as the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) mentioned. In an aircraft crash there are rarely, if ever, survivors. So there are no second chances if there is a slight lapse in regulation.

           What concerns me is the attitude of the new board that seems to be exemplified in statements that have been revealed which highlight what I see as the incongruity—and this is a slightly wider issue—of having a judge run a government board. It is really, in my view, inappropriate for judges to be involved in running government appointed boards. Here we have a judge who goes into the media and says in relation to the inquiry of Commissioner Staunton when looking at the report:
          </para>
          <para font-size="-=2">
           It appears that the errors that were made were not errors of expertise.
          </para>
          <para>
           Having regard to the report itself, that really is quite an absurd statement and unfortunately exposes the judge to criticism which, in my view, tends to undermine the judiciary as a whole. This is a wider issue but, when a judge is in this position, he is placed in this position by the government of the day by being offered an appointment of this nature. Overall, this can tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is an inappropriate decision in my view to appoint judges to these boards, and it is something that should be discouraged in the future.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           But in addition to that, the board itself, in my view, leaves a question mark over the expertise of members of that board. In reality, only one person has relevant aviation experience. With all due respect to the other members of the board, is it really appropriate that people with little or no experience of practical aviation even consider themselves? If they examined their own position before accepting such appointments, should they not really look very carefully at whether or not they feel they should accept positions of this nature?
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I know the government have made the offer, and maybe it starts with the government—this was the previous government I am speaking of—but the fact of the matter is it is also something that I would have thought they need to examine themselves. More particularly now that we have had quite trenchant criticism of the board by the minister, and criticism with which I respectfully agree, it is my view that the board really has to take a good hard look at itself.

           In conclusion, as far as the operator of this particular airline is concerned, it to me is absolutely on its face inexcusable that when that aircraft disappeared about 1&amp;half; hours elapsed before anyone was notified. Having regard to the recommendation for a criminal prosecution

          —In opening my comments on this report this morning, I too would extend my sympathies to the families. It was an incident in Australian aviation history that tore at the heart of all Australians, and one that engenders a lot of trepidation in some of the travelling public in Australia. When people line up to buy a ticket to travel on an aircraft somewhere, whether it be a small aircraft such as that that was involved in this incident or a 747&amp;hyphen;400 to travel overseas or a 737 to travel from Canberra to Sydney, there is an unquestionable expectation that the airworthiness of the aircraft being used in that flight has the clear imprimatur of the Commonwealth and of the people that are responsible for safety regulation. The travelling public in this country boards aircraft without giving a second thought to any malfunction that may happen or any incident that may lie ahead.

        <para first-indent="16">
         As a nation of air travellers in the world today, we are singly very lucky with the low number of accidents such as this. Certainly, this very tragic and apparently avoidable accident has brought to the fore a number of deficiencies that existed in the system at the time. I go back to an inquiry in late 1993 when I was a member of the then Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We were conducting an inquiry into the commercialisation of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority and the ways that had impacted on the services being provided by those two organisations in relation to their direct ownership by the taxpayers of Australia. More importantly, we were examining the safety elements involved in air traffic control and safety surveillance, and surveillance of the regulations that were supposed to be enforced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the CAA was commercialised, those activities of air traffic control and safety surveillance were all in the one organisation. They were all being run together. We had the opportunity at a public hearing in Sydney of taking evidence from the then Chief Executive Officer, Doug Roser, and the then Director of Safety Regulations, George Marcionis, both of whom appear in this report. They were called to give evidence before this royal commission. From memory, at the public hearing, the evidence that we took from those gentlemen was after the Monarch crash, but before the Seaview crash. I had asked questions at that stage of Marcionis whether he was satisfied that the way the CAA was implementing safety regulations and surveillance was satisfactory. I am sure that if we look in the records from that hearing that the evidence given from him was that it was, that the likes of Monarch would not happen again.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We all know that following the Monarch crash, in a speech that the then shadow minister, the now Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) gave in the House of Representatives, he indicated that he had concerns about the operations of Seaview prior to this incident. In the subsequent report of that inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee, we highlighted the dangers of having a safety regulator commercialised and operating on a commercial basis. The focus could be, and evidently was, too much on the commercial
         <break page="8644" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          imperatives of the organisation rather than on the overwhelming responsibility that was cast upon them to ensure that the air travelling public in Australia was safe.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I agree with the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) who spoke a while ago with regard to the focus being on the bottom end of the market, as it were, or on general aviation, and that there is a responsibility for the other 40 million travelling public. But this incident happened in the middle with RPT/charter operators that were working at the margin, I suppose. Maybe, the financial viability of their organisations was questionable but, just the same, as I said before, the people that bought tickets to travel on this aircraft to Lord Howe Island were entitled to the same expectation of safety as the person buying a ticket on 747&amp;hyphen;400 of Qantas to travel overseas. As a government we have a responsibility to ensure that in the future such accidents do not happen.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I had the opportunity of having a briefing yesterday from CASA staff, and there is no doubt that there is an enormous change in attitude following our recommendation of the JCPA that the responsibilities and activities of air traffic control be separated from safety regulation. Subsequently, the government of the day created Airservices Australia which is a corporate entity running as a business, controlling air traffic in our skies, and bringing safety regulations and safety surveillance back in as an agency to surveil the safety operations in the aviation sector in Australia.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I certainly was heartened yesterday to be briefed by CASA on what they are doing, how they are going to operate and the new focus of the organisation. We note the recommendations of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Plane Safe
         </emphasis>
         report of the former Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the member for Shortland, in the last parliament. Those recommendations have been taken up by the government. The now minister was a member of that committee in the last parliament. He participated in the complete inquiry that resulted in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Plane Safe
         </emphasis>
         report. So there is a commitment throughout this parliament to improve the regulation of the safety aspects of aviation in Australia today. I commend that to all members because it is of paramount importance.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue that has been referred to here this morning is the tension that apparently exists between the minister and some members of the board of CASA. That is, I think, a result of some differences of opinion as to what sorts of expertise should exist on that board—for example, the question of whether direct aviation experience is necessary on that board. A lot of us believe that it is, but that is one issue—previous speakers have alluded to the fact that it may or may not be having an impact on morale within CASA. I am sure it will sort itself out but the main object of the exercise at the moment for the government, for the department and for CASA is to improve immeasurably on what has happened in the past but certainly to restructure the organisation and the focus of the organisation so that they realise and they are committed to what they are there for.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After the briefing that we received yesterday, I am sure that that is going to occur. There is a commitment by the minister to ensure that that happens and to ensure that when we buy a ticket to travel on an aircraft somewhere we can do that in the complete confidence that we are travelling very safely, unlike the case in a lot of other countries in the world.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With the dramatic increase in the amount of air travel around the world, the responsibilities incumbent on CASA are not only to surveil aircraft that originate out of this country but also to surveil aircraft that travel into and out of Australia—foreign carriers—which, from time to time, carry Australian nationals. Those aircraft, as we have seen, can certainly make a big hole
         <break page="8645" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in the ground and they can be very dangerous. There was a recent incident in New Delhi and neither of those aircraft were Indian national aircraft, they were foreign carriers but they were operating in that country and carrying some of their nationals.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So there is a responsibility, and a growing responsibility, on CASA to surveil aircraft that are operating in and out of Australia because, from time to time, we do travel with those airlines. There is a growing concern in that area. CASA are aware of it and are implementing measures to do that. As a parliament and certainly as a government, we are going to support CASA. I know the minister is supporting them with the new regime they are implementing with regard to the management of CASA, particularly as a result of those tragedies, originally with Monarch and, more importantly today, with the inquiry of the royal commission that was conducted into the tragedy of that Seaview flight.

       (1) Yes, the Child Support Agency made two submissions to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The first referred to the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent's `exempted income amount' at various points. It also referred to the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent's `self support component' at various points. At page 124 it said, "(the current legislation sets two income figures which could be said to represent the concept of self support. There is a basic amount used in the assessment (self support
       <break page="8654" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       `Exempted income amount' appeared in a glossary of terms, and was defined as "that part of the non&amp;hyphen;custodial parent's taxable income which is not taken into account in assessing child support, that is, the single pension rate if there are no other children or the married pension rate plus an allowance for each child if there are other dependent children." `Self support component' did not appear in this glossary.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (2) No, the `exempted income amount' and the `self support component' are not different concepts, but different ways of expressing the same concept.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       (3) The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 uses the term `exempted income amount', with its meaning given by section 39. `Self support component' was used by the Agency as an alternative to simplify the child support assessment formula. The Agency no longer tends to use the term `self support component'.
