                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to reintroduce this bill today, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Banning Dirty Donations) Bill 2022, and to continue our efforts to get big money out of politics. If passed, this bill would stop dirty industries with a track record of seeking to influence decision-makers through donations: the fossil fuel, banking and defence sectors, and the pharmaceutical, liquor, tobacco and gambling industries. It would stop them from making political donations to buy outcomes to suit them. This bill would also limit the amount that can be donated by individuals and all other entities to $3,000 per electoral term, minimising the opportunity for anybody's big money to buy outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has never been a more important time for donation reform. Our democracy is in trouble. Public trust in parliament and politicians is at an all-time low, and the community feel less and less confident that their representatives represent them, as opposed to the corporate donors. It's no wonder. In the past decade, $230 million have flowed in corporate donations to the Labor, Liberal and National parties from the likes of the big banks; from industries like mining, defence and big pharma; from property developers; and from alcohol, tobacco and gambling companies. These are just some of the industries that have paid the Liberal, National and Labor parties to put their private profits ahead of the needs of our community. These industries are not donating millions of dollars because they believe in the institution of strong democracy. They are donating because it gets results for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have maintained the Democracy for Sale website for over a decade, tracking publicly disclosed political donations and putting the spotlight on influence peddling. In 2018 the Senate Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations laid out examples of the nexus between donations made by industry bodies and public policy outcomes or project approvals. The cosy relationships and the proximity of donations and policy outcomes that boost industry profits suggest undue influence. The community continues to pay the price through climate inaction, propping up destructive gambling practices and governments that refuse to make corporations pay their fair share of tax so that everyday people can get the education, health care, dental care, and income support that they need. Until we break the hold of dirty donations over the big parties—over all parties—big corporations will keep winning and the community will keep losing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the corrosive influence of donations from the development sector and the influence that they had on planning policy, infrastructure and development, the Queensland and New South Wales governments have legislated to restrict political donations from property developers. The High Court has upheld those regulations, and this bill seeks to extend those to the federal arena, but it also recognises the influence of other key industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2012, the fossil fuel and resources industries have donated over $9 million to both of the major political parties. The Australia Institute estimates that, in 2021-22 alone, Australian governments handed out $11.6 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel giants in things like grants, loans, cheap fuel and accelerated depreciation. That was $1.3 billion more than in the previous year, despite there being a COVID crisis that saw so many ordinary Australians struggling to make ends meet—what a great return on investment. Rather than turning off the tap in the most recent budget, the new Labor government gifted $1.9 billion of new money for gas in the Northern Territory, on top of continuing the nearly $40 billion in Morrison government fossil fuel subsidies, including $40 million for fuel tax credits enjoyed by that industry—again, a very good return on investment for fossil fuel donors and a terrible deal for the climate and the rest of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generous donations bought a Liberal government at the time that was completely paralysed by the words 'climate change' at the same time as the Australian community was facing a future of more extreme bushfires, crippling droughts and floods. Donations continue to cloud the judgement of the Albanese government as new coal and gas projects keep getting approvals and public money. The gas industry donates millions of dollars, so it was no surprise when the former Prime Minister appointed his gas industry mates to a National COVID Coordination Commission without even needing to declare their conflicts of interest. It was also no surprise that the commission ultimately called for a gas led recovery that directly benefited the gas industry, despite strong support for a renewables led recovery from scientists, economists and policy analysts. Again, the community lost the opportunity for a sustainable recovery, because governments are beholden to fossil fuel donors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cozy relationships and financial support have led to a situation where, despite overwhelming scientific and economic evidence, we will not even reach the weak 43 per cent emissions reductions targets unless we end our attachment to fossil fuels. The Albanese government refuses to rule out any of the 113 coal and gas projects that are currently under consideration. In fact, they continue to hand out public money to support destructive new projects in the Beetaloo basin, Scarborough and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the bullying tactics by the Minerals Council kill the Rudd government's mining super profits tax, and now we're seeing the Minerals Council use the same tactics against the Queensland Labor government's current plans to get resources companies to pay more. Those threats only work because the major parties rely on donations. The possibility generous donations will be withdrawn is the leverage the industry uses to keep governments in check.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The banking and financial sector is also a regular contributor and beneficiary. The sector has donated about $76 million since 2012 to both sides of politics. That support secured them immunity for some time, despite the evidence of customers being ripped off around the country. Both of the major parties had to be dragged to the banking royal commission—something the Greens had campaigned for since 2014—following scandal after scandal and public backlash over their inaction. How much faster would the commission have happened if the Liberal, National and Labor parties weren't on the payroll of the banks? Would we have seen stronger action in response to the scathing royal commission report?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gambling industry is another significant donor to state and federal political parties. Their influence can be seen in the deeply entrenched support for poker machines throughout Australia, including exemptions for clubs from COVID restrictions, even when so many other venues suffered and despite the human suffering and toll that the gambling industry wreaks on ordinary people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Property developers also continue to throw their donations weight around while fighting against planning restrictions or tax reforms or stronger environmental law. In Queensland, a destructive proposal for a canal estate within the Ramsar listed Toondah wetlands that are the gateway to Minjerribah—as Meanjin folk know Stradbroke Island—should never have gotten past the first hurdle. The federal environment department recommended that the project be rejected as clearly unacceptable. Yet the property developer, Walker Corporation, was a generous political donor and—hey presto!—the minister then allowed the deeply flawed proposal to proceed through the assessment phase. It was not rejected at the outset, as the department had suggested it should be. The minister at the time, who was Mr Frydenberg, even explored the possibility of changing the Ramsar boundaries to accommodate the proposal. We have the documentary evidence of that. I live in hope that the new environment minister will finally reject this destructive proposal, but the local community should never have had to fight so hard and for so long against such a clearly unacceptable development.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are only the donations that we know about, none of which has been illegal. It doesn't include the money paid to attend business forums or 'cash for access' meetings. It ignores the exorbitant subscription or membership fees, and it doesn't include money funnelled through representative and fundraising bodies. Regardless of the source or the amount, the obvious expectation from industry is that donations will return results. They're buying outcomes. This feeds the public perception that decisions in this place are made improperly, with self-interest and with the interests of donors or mates consistently overriding the public interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In banning political donations from those industries that have a history of seeking to influence policy decisions, this bill implements a key recommendation of the Senate Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations. It would make it an offence for a prohibited donor to make a donation or solicit another person to make a donation on their behalf. It would also be an offence to accept a donation from a prohibited donor. Another committee recommendation that this bill seeks to implement is to limit other political donations to $3,000 in an election term, or $1,000 per year. As the High Court recognised in McCloy v New South Wales, the uncontrolled use of wealth to influence decision-making compromises equal participation in democracy. By aggregating and capping political donations made by any person or entity, this bill seeks to level the playing field and avoid those with more money getting greater access to decision-makers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will limit donations made for political purposes but is not intend to limit donations made to third parties to support their non-campaign activities. The important work done by civil society organisations, many of them charities, must be allowed to continue. We will continue to call for the introduction of electoral expenditure caps to balance the participation of civil society organisations in the political process. This bill complements other reforms to strengthen the disclosure regime that the government has finally committed to acting on, including lowering the disclosure thresholds and requiring real-time disclosure of donations, so people aren't waiting 18 months to find out who's buying who.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens strongly support these measures, but we recognise that transparency alone will not remove the corrupting influence of political donations. The 2022 election results confirm that the Australian public want more transparent and representative governments that act in the public interest. This bill is an important first step towards getting big money out of politics and restoring public confidence in our democracy. If we are committed to enhancing the democratic process—which is, surely, something that every parliament should regularly turn its mind to—this should be a priority. This bill does not stifle debate or prevent individuals from donating a small amount to support a political party; it bans donations from industries that have become associated with having a corrupting influence on how we work as decision-makers. It will return democracy to the community. Democracy should not be for sale to the highest bidder, and it's about time that we banned those big corrupting donations to political parties and capped the amount that anyone can donate to support a political party or grouping of their choice.</span>

It's one of the most important features of our obligations here in the Senate to think carefully about the work that we do here and the way that it protects and bolsters our really proud legacy as a multicultural, democratic nation with a universal franchise, and we should always be thinking carefully about the way that our system supports and recognises that. One of the puzzling things about being a participant in debates in this chamber over the last few years is the consistent approach that the Greens political party takes to democratic institutions, because almost every occasion that sees the Senate debate these questions sees members of the Greens political party come into this chamber and talk endlessly about how democracy is broken. Strangely, for a party that I think would see democracy as a core part of their tenets, the Greens political party choose always to assert that democracy doesn't work, and I would invite Greens senators to carefully reflect on the consequences on that narrative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the interesting things I observe, from sitting in this part of the chamber as a member of a party of government and sitting on that side of the chamber as a member of a major political party that seeks to form government and enact change through the institution of government, is very close relationships between the rhetorical positioning of members who sit on this side of the crossbench and members who sit on that side of the crossbench, because what the Greens political party and One Nation have in common is a determination to tell their voters and their supporters that democracy doesn't work. That's the basis of their pitch to voters. It's important we talk about our democratic institutions. We'll always welcome that conversation, and I do thank the Greens for putting it on the agenda today. But I invite you as a political party to think about the consequences of that contribution and to reflect on the similarities between your own approach and the rhetorical approach taken by some of the people that I know you do not agree with.</span>

                    </a>  The truth is that electoral reform requires support from across the parliament. In August this year, as is always the case after an election, the Special Minister of State asked the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to inquire into and report on all aspects of the conduct of the 2022 federal election, and I think the terms of that referral are important and significant and provide an important opportunity for all senators in this chamber to participate in a structured way in a dialogue with other political parties and civil society about how we best conduct elections. But it is worth looking at the terms, because they refer to reforms to political donation laws, particularly the applicability of real-time disclosure and a reduction of the disclosure threshold to a fixed $1,000; potential reforms to the funding of elections, particularly regarding electoral expenditure caps and public funding of political parties and candidates; and the potential for truth in political advertising laws to enhance the integrity and transparency of the electoral system.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government we are interested in exploring with the parliament the ways that we can improve and enhance our electoral systems, and we're interested in doing that in a collaborative way, not in a way that seeks to score cheap political points off political opponents. The truth is that we are very proud as a party of the contribution that we have made in leading reforms to electoral laws. It was Labor that secured the ban on foreign donations, protecting our political system from foreign interference. It was Labor's amendments that linked public funding to campaign expenditure, preventing parties from profiting from the political system. You can go back to Bob Hawke in 1983; Labor, under Prime Minister Hawke, introduced a donations disclosure regime for the first time. It's a Labor reform, and we do those things because we know that transparency is the key to preventing and identifying corruption. I think that those are shared values across the chamber, or at least I hope that they are. It's why we continue to drive a reform agenda. It's actually Labor, not the opposition or the Greens, who have been driving the agenda for political donation reform over a very long time, driving the agenda for transparency and driving the agenda for government accountability. It was Labor who fought for that ban on foreign political donations. The Liberal Party didn't want to stop taking donations from foreign sources, despite the risk of foreign influence to our democracy, and had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept those amendments. It was Labor, of course, who protected charities—</span>

Everyone in this chamber has the opportunity to do so. I note the process that is on foot at the moment through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, but this is an important opportunity for a conversation, and I look forward to the contributions from other senators.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:22</span>):  Imagine waking up a Green! Imagine waking up as a member of the Greens of Australia. You'd wake up each morning and be so angry with the world. They wake up and they just punch the pillows because they're so angry with the world. I feel sorry for the Greens—'Woe is me that Australia is such a bad place, that we're all going to hell in a handcart. And guess what's going to make Australia a better place. We're going to stop someone who owns a pub from giving a donation to a political party.' That's what this bill is about. This bill is about stopping someone who owns a pub, whether it's the Queen's Arm, the Sandy Creek pub down the road from me, the Einasleigh Hotel—any of the many pubs across Queensland. If the publican and their family want to give $50 or $100 to a local political party, whether it's the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, the Greens, the LNP or Labor—but no. You own a pub, you support so many community groups, but you can't give $50 or $100 to your local political party, because stopping people who own pubs from giving donations is going to make Australia a better place!</span>

                    </a>  pat a cat or kiss a dog. Do something like that. But do not read this bill, because this is a waste of space and a waste of time, in writing. That is what this is. People wonder what people in Canberra get up to. Well, guess what? We waste time on pointless bills like this that want to stop law-abiding Australians from supporting the political party or the political cause of their choice. That's what this is about. This is about the Greens, who've become the puritans of Australian politics. Soon, we're going to be all walking around like the 'brides of green'. We'll be wearing dark-green or soft-green outfits, covering up any bodily features, because the Greens have become so puritanical in wanting to stop people from having fun unless it's their type of fun.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, I don't care what the Greens get up to in their spare time—I'm a libertarian. If they want to do things behind closed doors with the windows shut, they can do it. But this bill would apply to someone involved in a legal industry, such as a pub—because pubs are terrible places, aren't they, ladies and gentlemen! This shows how out of touch the Greens are. I'm someone who sends out a pub calendar each year. I pay for them myself and send out pub calendars. Because guess what pubs do? Pubs are actually community groups. Pubs are community organisations. Country pubs do so much for their local organisations. I look at the pubs in my district in the Darling Downs. If you go past a pub, often you'll see a tonne of cars out the front at 11 o'clock in the morning. You'll think, 'Jeez, people are starting early today.' But do you know what it is? Often they're having community meetings there. They're using the pub as the local community hall to talk about Landcare or about issues impacting the local community. That is because pubs are the bastion of their local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill by the Greens, they don't want those people supporting political parties or supporting political causes. Heaven help me—publicans are such bad people! If you don't think that people should participate in the democratic process, why don't you just ban them? Go and ban pubs. This is why the Greens are the puritans of Australian politics. They don't want you to have fun. They want to ban stuff that they don't like. They're quite happy to sit in their darkened corners and munch on a bit of moss and talk to each other about the grand old days when Bob Brown was leader: 'Wasn't it fantastic? We stopped everything from happening in Tasmania. Isn't it brilliant? The unemployment rate's up to 20 per cent under our policies.' That's what the Greens are all about because they're the party of misery. Imagine waking up as a green each morning. I suppose it could be worse; you could wake up next to a green! But anyway.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have wasted five or 10 minutes of my life reading this bill. Another episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Andor</span> hasn't come out. <span style="font-style:italic;">Andor</span> is a great series for those people who are watching it. I got up to episode 12 last week. I've got to wait for the next season to come out.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens also want to stop people from giving money to political parties if they are involved in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. So they want to stop pharmacists. They want to stop chemists. They want to stop community pharmacy. The other bastion of regional towns, suburbs and villages across Australia—those evil people!—is pharmacists. Do you know who makes up one of the most trusted professions in Australia? Pharmacists. Community pharmacy. The Greens want to stop community pharmacists—those people who do so much for the health and wellbeing of Australians. They want to stop that evil industry of pharmacists from getting involved in the political process by supporting a political cause. Are you serious? What were you on when you wrote this? You were probably on something that was prescribed to you by a pharmacist, and you overdosed on it, or, quite frankly, you should go to a pharmacist and get some medication to stop you from writing such rubbish.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just bonkers stuff. There are so many more important issues in Australia at the moment that I'm sure this chamber could be united on to make the best country in the world that much better. Quite frankly, being a bunch of wowsers on heat and wandering down the main streets of the towns and villages of Australia, being these puritans stopping law-abiding citizens from participating in the democratic process does not assist. It doesn't help democracy at all. What this does is stop people from participating in democracy. It stops law-abiding people from participating in democracy, and that is not a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the comments of Senator McAllister. The government, as is the case after each election, regardless of the political colours of the government, write to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and ask it to conduct an inquiry into the previous election. There are specific terms of reference, which Senator Farrell has put in his letter, asking the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to inquire into. I sit on this committee along with Senator Cadell, and we are taking a very serious and sober look into the running of the 2022 election and also into the proposals that the Labor Party have outlined. It won't surprise people in the chamber to know that we do oppose many of the proposals that have been put forward by the Labor Party—for example, giving New Zealanders and other foreigners the right to vote in Australian elections. We oppose that. We certainly will oppose spending caps because we do not believe spending caps will assist in promoting a pluralistic democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at what's happened in Queensland, where the state elections are not run on an electoral system that is fair—there is a financial gerrymander, because political parties are capped at spending $15 million but unions are capped at $10 million. There are 26 registered unions in Queensland. There's one Labor Party, there is one Liberal-National Party and there are the Greens and various other minor parties. What it means is that those on the centre right of politics are capped at spending $15 million in an electoral cycle, but for those on the Left—the Greens, Labor and 26 unions—well, 26 times 10 is 260. For those who are arithmetically challenged, that's $260 million that the unions can spend in campaigning against the election of a Liberal-National Party plus $30 million from the Greens. That's $290 million, whereas my party is limited to $15 million. That is a complete and utter financial gerrymander. There is no fair electoral system in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the proposals that I suspect Labor may bring forward will be a financial gerrymander at a federal level. That would not be fair and it would not be appropriate. What is also not fair and not appropriate is to bring in a similar financial gerrymander that locks out those who are engaged in legal industries from participating in the democratic process. If the Greens don't think that someone who is involved in defence industry or in a financial institution or has a pub or is in the resource sector or runs a chemist or is a property developer or anything like that should participate in the democratic process, it shows their Stalinist approach to a pluralist democracy, but it also shows their failure to understand how the Australian economy works, because you are talking about tens of thousands of people—indeed, hundreds of thousands if not millions of Australians—who depend on these industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Greens are saying is that you might work for your local pub, but you're a bad person because you work for a pub. We don't like pubs because we don't like fun. We don't like people getting out and enjoying themselves. We don't think your pub should be able to donate or support the political party of your choice, unless it's the Greens, because, let's face it, the Greens want to turn us into a one-party state. Being a member of the Greens party is just a massive example of waking up in a bed by yourself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the Greens want to do to Australia: you can only have thoughts that the Greens agree with, you can only have beliefs that the Greens agree with and you can only support causes that the Greens agree with. Now, if you want to support the Greens—because, quite frankly, you are one chromosome short of the village idiot—go ahead and do it. That is your choice. I'm not going to stop you from doing that. If you want to support my party, or Labor or any of the minor parties, do it. I encourage people to get involved in the political process. I encourage people to join political parties or causes of their choice. I'm not going to stop you doing it. I don't want to stop you doing it; we need more people to get involved in Australia's democracy, not fewer people. We need to stop shaming people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, how many people work in the resource sector? I reckon it's almost 300,000 people whose jobs depend on the resource sector. So they say to them: 'Well, too bad. You can't really work there.' We're talking about people who work in the financial sector—probably also 300,000 people—and we're talking about people who work in the property sector, probably talking about another 200,000 Australians. Then we're talking about the hundreds of thousands of people who work in chemists and pharmacies across Australia. We're saying to those people: 'You're not worthy. You're not worthy of participating in Australia's democracy, because we don't like you—because we're the Greens. We're the puritans. We're pure. We wouldn't do anything wrong.' Well, the more someone tells me that they're pure, the more someone tells me that they're righteous and the more someone tells me that they're on the side of all that is good then the more I check my back pocket to make sure I've not been pickpocketed by them and the more I make sure I go to my house and make sure my TV hasn't been nicked by them!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the Greens are all about. They sit in the peanut gallery, they throw rocks and stones at the parties of government, say how terrible we all are and how terrible Australia is. They run down Australia; they run down Australia from a democratic perspective and they run down Australia from a financial perspective, because their party is the politics of grievance. Their politics is angry politics. Their politics is not about what's doing best for Australia it's about what's doing best for the Green political movement. They want to stop people who run chemists and who run pharmacies. They want to stop people who run country pubs from getting involved in the political process. This is what the Greens movement has come to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what Bob Brown is doing at the moment, but he could basically become a wind turbine at the moment in terms of oscillating around with his disappointment with the modern Greens movement—that they've shifted from the great environmental battles of the 1980s and 1990s to become the party of just: 'Nah, the computer says no. We're a bunch of puritans. We don't want you to have fun. We don't want people who own pubs or run country pubs to get involved with the political process.'</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  I rise to commend Senator Waters on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Banning Dirty Donations) Bill 2022. Clearly, if you want to trigger the major parties, just bring up meaningful political donation reform. This is the inconvenient truth in Australian politics, that we're in a situation where companies are gaming the political system, a system that is about Australians casting their vote and every vote having the same value. That is now being co-opted by companies across this country to buy political influence. Four of the five last federal elections have been won by the major party with the biggest war chest. I would suggest that this is not a direction we want to head down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want meaningful reform when it comes to political donations. Australians want to know their politicians are making decisions based on what is good for their communities, not just on what may be good for their donor. Senator McGrath talked about how this will limit people being able to participate in democracy and donate. On the contrary, this makes it more accessible to Australians, to actual people. Corporations are not people, and corporations are gaming the political system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reading this bill, I tend to think $3,000 per person per term is a fairly level playing field. We don't want to be in a situation where, because you have more wealth, you can donate far more than the average Australian could ever afford to donate. Clearly, when we allow corporations to donate they can outspend almost all but maybe the richest Australians. This is about returning democracy to the Australian people. People in the resources sector, workers who work in mining, making personal donations to the political party of their choice is not the same as resource companies making large political donations to the major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last three years the Liberals have accepted just over $2.3 million from fossil fuel companies. Labor have accepted just over $1.1 million. The Nationals have accepted $221,000. That's $3.7 million of money that is clearly influencing the debate on crucial issues like global warming, like this parliament's response to what we're seeing on the news every day now, with worsening climate impacts, with a climate that is breaking down. We're seeing weather we haven't seen before; we're moving into a new climate. Clearly this isn't a good way to make decisions that are going to benefit everyday Australians and future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Political donation reform is something that Australians want. People in communities across the country are calling for it. Today we're seeing the vested interests in the major parties.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DAVID POCOCK:</span>
                    </a>  That may be nonsense, Senator McAllister. Let's take gambling as an example. I'm sure senators here would receive a fair bit of correspondence about gambling. There are Australians across the country very worried about the impact gambling is having—gambling advertising, specifically—on children. The statistics show it is having a huge negative impact on young people. We know that. Government agencies have the data, saying there are a large percentage of children now who think gambling is something that adults do, that it is normal. We're seeing children who are 16 and 17 not just gambling but being at risk of problem gambling before they are even legally allowed to gamble. Yet neither of the major parties are willing to implement the gambling advertising reform that most Australians want. Most Australians do not want to put on sport and see gambling advertising when they're watching with their children. Yet when we try and get the new government to take that seriously we get a change in slogans. You cannot tell me that all this money that is flowing into the major political parties from the gaming and gambling industry lobby is not having an effect. If we were listening to everyday Australians we'd be saying: 'This is a huge problem. It is not good for the future of our country. So, we're going to have a response that deals with it.' Experts have said that one of the things that should be done is to ban any gambling advertising in the hours that children watch television, as we've done with other products that are harmful. Yet we get this lukewarm response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Senator McAllister, I simply do not accept your interjection that this has no effect. Clearly it does. We could say the same when it comes to climate politics in Australia. This has become a political football. We've seen the fossil fuel industry use politicians, political parties, to kick this problem down the road, to the point where we are now in a crisis and we're going to have to do things that rise to the level of crisis that we're facing, whereas if we had had a parliament that was connected to everyday Australians, connected to the science, willing to listen, then we could have started to deal with this a long time ago. It would have been a much steadier and simpler transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would urge the major parties to reconnect with Australians, to reconnect with the people we are all in here to represent. My sense from talking to people in the ACT is that political donation reform is right up there. People realise that our political system is being gamed, that companies have huge influence in this building. They walk the halls, they walk into politicians' offices, they make donations and they run events. We have to deal with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the government's openness to review this and to look into it, and I look forward to having the kind of reform that is being called for by everyday Australians and by experts who have looked at this issue for a long time. This is not a new issue or concern. Both sides of politics have been in government in recent history. Clearly, as with having a National Anti-Corruption Commission, which was on the back of the Greens and Independents pushing for that for a long time, it's politically inconvenient but it's good for Australia. As senators we have a duty to do what is good for the people we represent, not the party whose line we vote along. That's our huge challenge, for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Senator Waters for continuing to push this issue. It resonates with everyday Australians. The longer we leave this, the more we're going to see Australians starting to find candidates who are willing to stand up and say: 'We can do better. We can return our democracy to the people. We can have rules in place that ensure that it is a level playing field, that big companies can't donate hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars which clearly are having an effect, and it's inconvenient on both sides. In 2021 the biggest donor to the coalition was Pratt Holdings, with more than $1.2 million in donations to the Liberal Party. On the Labor side the biggest support came from its associated entities and several unions, including the SDA, the UWU and the CFMMEU, who donated $3.67 million collectively.</span>

                    </a>  Again, Senator Ciccone, I appreciate your interjection and I really welcome the renewed focus on political donations now we're seeing tens of thousands of Australians making donations to independents and minor parties. For the first time that I can remember we had the former Prime Minister in the campaign talking about it, highlighting the need to tackle political donations. Indeed, we now have a government that is committed to doing that. Let's remember that there is a clear difference between Australians donating their own money in a personal capacity, versus companies or unions donating. I sense there's an appetite to go back to having rules that make it a level playing field and that ensure that everyday Australians have the ability to donate should they want to. We don't want to stop that, but we do want to stop the undue influence that is clearly being seen and is playing out in the way that we are dealing with some of the really big and thorny issues we face, like action on climate, what our response to gambling is. We are the biggest losers in the world when it comes to gambling—$25 billion or so a year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill. On behalf of people in the ACT I represent, I will keep pushing this. This is something that is important to people in the ACT. They want to see meaningful action. They're sick of seeing decisions being made that aren't in the best interests of Australians. They're sick of having governments that argue that the government doesn't have a duty of care to future generations. If we don't have a duty of care to future generations, what are we here for? This is a meaningful way of putting checks and balances and added transparency in place so that Australians can look at this place and say, 'I can be more confident now that decisions are being made that are going to benefit me and my family and my children, and their future and their children's children, rather than some big gambling or fossil fuel company that can spray $100,000 a year to buy a bit of influence in this place. I commend this bill. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  I rise to speak to this bill, which is basically laced with hypocrisy. This bill does nothing. It's got one side of the picture, in terms of private sector, but doesn't mention anything about money coming from unions or super funds. It doesn't mention anything about the inherent influence inside bureaucracies. I know that the promoter of this bill worked for the Environmental Defenders Office for about a decade. Of course, she's one of many left-wing Marxists in the bureaucracy who get paid by the taxpayer to be impartial, but I have no doubt that this is a scheme that's employed by the left—whenever you talk about any environmental stuff, they always run off to the Environmental Defenders Office and then use the law—'lawfare'—to effectively shut down any sort of new production. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this slur going around 'we can't have money from fossil fuel donors'. Somehow a diesel fuel rebate is some sort of a rort. If you want to know what a rort is, it's the people who live in these inner-city houses. The biggest tax expenditure discount in the budget is the CGT grant on wealthy houses in inner-city electorates. Yet these same hypocrites come in here and call the diesel fuel rebate, incurred by producers who don't go anywhere near a road, a rort. That is not the case at all. When farmers plant their crops, they don't go anywhere near a road. I myself am from a farm of 150,000 acres. It can take you two hours to get to the boundary just to go and check your water. We would drive thousands of kilometres a year just to check our bores, and we're meant to pay for roads we don't use. How is this somehow a rort?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice there's a key word in there—that we're going exclude people that volunteer their time. The thing is, in the private sector, if you didn't know, small businesses work seven days a week, 24 hours a day. They don't always have the time to help the parties. That's why they decide to give money. 'We'd love to help you out. We don't actually have the time, but use it for advertising or whatever.' There's an implication that all donations are bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't like gambling any more than a lot of people in this chamber, but the fact of the matter is that that was brought in by a crony deal between the Goss Labor government; Kevin Rudd, who was the chief of staff at the time; and the unions, who wanted to bring gambling into Queensland. What have we got for it? I tell you what regional Queensland got for it: nothing. What we got was a lot of heartache. In my home town of Chinchilla, when I was growing up, we didn't have any poker machines in the pubs, but we had a maternity ward and we had a council. We don't have a maternity ward or a council anymore, but we've got poker machines. So no-one's going to be influencing me—and no-one does influence me when it comes to donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that this bill completely overlooks is the influence of lobbyists, who don't have to disclose how much people pay them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You want to know who the real shadow government in this country is? It's the bureaucracies who are stacked with left-wing supporters—and they are left-wing supporters—and the lack of accountability in these so-called independent bodies. I did a post this morning, about my tenth one on RBA, about how they refuse to bring our gold home. They refuse to do a proper audit. There's no accountability there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you another great example. The Bureau of Meteorology used to just have the weather—the vision. These guys would go out, they'd measure the temperature or they'd record the temperature, and that was it. End of story. But now they have this whole new division called the climate division. Their job is to go and create new sets of data that's been manipulated from the original raw data. They wrap big words around it, like 'homogenisation' et cetera, so that most people don't even understand what they're talking about, but it's actually manipulated data. You don't go back and create a new dataset, and fudge the data. You report the original data with a margin of error; that's what you should be doing. I've spoken to the ABC, another so-called independent body, about why, when they report this data, they don't distinguish between homogenised data and raw data. Why don't they report the raw data with a margin of error? That's how you do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the private sector, if you came up with three, four or five sets of different accounts—Al Capone style—you'd be thrown in jail, but, no, not within the bureaucracy, because it doesn't suit the narrative of the bureaucracy that maybe the temperature hasn't risen as much as they claim it has. It hasn't. The raw data doesn't show anywhere near the increase in temperature that the homogenised data does. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's just another example of the influence coming not from money or from the use of volunteer or paid power but from people who are paid by the taxpayer to deliver goods and services who aren't actually delivering goods and services at all. What they're doing is using the bureaucracy to push their own ideology, and that is corruption. That is corruption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we go again to the hypocrisy of this bill with superannuation. The first thing the Labor government did when they got in was to remove the disclosure laws around how much money superannuation funds donate to political parties, via the unions or whatever. Did the Greens vote for greater transparency there? No, I don't think they did. They didn't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the pharma industry? Big pharma—I'm not talking about pharmacies, by the way, Senator McGrath. I'm talking about big pharma. Did the Greens back our bill to get that contract disclosed? No, they didn't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go and look at who the Greens' all-time biggest donor is, it's none other than Graeme Wood, a guy that made his millions through travelling—from being basically an online booking agent for people to travel the world. How much CO2 does travelling the world actually consume? And they have the hide to come in here and cast slurs on our primary producers, our miners and our farmers, that somehow these guys are bad. But it's gross hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the Victorian Greens party, their biggest donor was of course the Electrical Trades Union. They'd be making a lot of money out of wiring all of these solar panels, the wind turbines that we can't recycle and all the batteries that are going to be installed. Can you see the connection for the Electrical Trades Union, that's going to get paid a lot of money and a lot of jobs for the sparkies by setting up all this new electrical wiring? Think of all the transmission lines where they're going to be ripping the guts out and scarring our beautiful landscape. Think of the dead koalas from these transmission lines and the dead wombats from these EVs with greater braking speeds. Think of that! That's terrible. We have all those inner-city elites driving down from their North Shore suburbs or as they drive up to the snow every year from the inner city of Melbourne in their EV cars with 800-kilogram batteries in the middle of them which increase the braking speed. The hypocrisy of these people is breathtaking!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was another comment I heard, 'Accelerated depreciation is somehow a rort'. No! If you're going to drop a million dollars on a tractor—and it costs a lot of money to buy a tractor to go around and around—you won't sell that tractor again any time soon for anywhere near a million dollars. It costs a lot of money for big capital-intensive equipment, and to claim that getting a tax deduction for a genuine cost of doing business is somehow a rort is just absurd. It is just absurd! But, yet again, we have the Greens completely divorced from reality. They don't seem to understand that small businesses in this country don't necessarily have the time to go out and campaign. We saw that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other great big hypocrisy in all this is with the teals, for example. Of course, their biggest funder is Simon Holmes a Court. He got his wealth from his father, Robert Homes a Court, who made lots of money in the eighties from investing in mining companies. We have this classic hypocrisy yet again: 'Don't worry about where my wealth came from. Once I've got my millions I'm then going to do the backflip and suddenly start being holier-than-thou to alleviate my guilt.' I know that Senator Pocock often talks about growing up on a farm and that he respects the farmers. I suggest, Senator Pocock, that if you want you could come out to our property one day and look at how far it takes to drive from our house out to our boundaries, and how much petrol we use each year. By the way, my dad never claimed the diesel fuel rebate. I used to tell him to do it, but he just won't take any sort of handout from the government. He just doesn't want anything to do with government—he doesn't want the government in his life. That's why he lives on a property of 150,000 acres, miles from anywhere. Obviously, I have inherited some of his traits because that's how I feel when it comes to government as well.</span>

                    </a>  I look at these figures and I ask myself, 'Where will we end up? The other thing we haven't spoken about—and I must touch on this—is their influence on the childcare industry. I've often said that you only have to look at the union movement in this country, which is down to 10 per cent of the workers. The reason why the unions grasp onto our children in child care is that the only growing union in this country is the United Voice, because of the rapid increase in child care. These people say that they want to look after our children; I don't want the government looking after our children. I want that childcare payment going directly to the parent and letting the parent choose. Just like when it comes to the transgender stuff, let the parent decide. When it comes to our space in this country, the government doesn't invade our personal space and there's too much of that happening with big government. I've seen that since I've come down here, whether it's in child care or how we look after our health, you name it, or how we save our money; the unions, big government and the bureaucracy are the true shadow government of this country and they have no accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the hypocrisy of this bill. When we tried to move amendments to get greater transparency over costings on reaching the 43 per cent target by 2030—don't have a clue. Senator McAllister doesn't have a clue how many kilometres of transmission lines we need to reach that target by 2030. They don't have a clue how many batteries and how much energy needs to be stored, and they certainly have no idea about costings. We've done the same for the pharmaceutical contracts. I'm about to bring up another OPD on the Auditor-General. Another ex-Labor staffer didn't declare he was an ex-Labor staffer when he applied for a job. He seemed to think that was 30 or 40 years ago, so it didn't matter. Yet again, it matters because a leopard doesn't change its spots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to get all this stuff and tamp down on donations, I think every bureaucrat in this country should be made to declare whom they vote for at every election, so we know whether or not they're impartial. They shouldn't be allowed to vote. That would be the best way. Once you become a bureaucrat, you've got to be completely impartial. Don't let them vote, or we can make them disclose which way they vote, so we know how they think. For too long these guys have been running a protection racket for the left side of politics. We had one public servant in estimates start saying, 'We're the government,' and Senator Hollie Hughes very quickly picked up on the fact that he should've actually been impartial.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, if you want to know who really controls this government, it's the bureaucrats, the unions, the super funds, the big end of town and the inner-city elites. It is not the battlers. They're out there. They're voiceless. Most of them are too busy working. Whether you like it or not in this country, politics is followed by only a very small sliver of people in this country, and most of the reason why is that they're too busy working. Some people, when they get later in life and they have a bit of money, might want to donate to the party, but this bill will destroy their right to participate in democracy, because they don't always have the time of young uni students. That's how Josh got rolled. Basically the teals got a couple of thousand people to go doorknocking and paid them $40. Is it going to apply to the teals, who pay their volunteers to go doorknocking? Is this bill going to apply to that? This says non-volunteer labour; how does it work out when the teals and the Greens pay their volunteers to go doorknocking?</span>

Are we going to do that? No, of course not. If we want to have true democracy in this country—and I'm all for disclosure, but this is one sided—next time I'll bring that big pharmaceutical bill up, Senator Waters, and see whether or not you want to vote on what we spent the $8 billion on with these vaccines, what we got for that and what was in that deal. You didn't do that, so I don't want to hear about how you're against the big end of town, because every time we try and wedge you guys on making the big end of town more transparent, you always vote with Labor. I'll be putting the bureaucrats up to ICAC. I'm going to have a lot of fun doing this, because Mr Albanese, the Prime Minister, will shut that down.</span>

Out come the wacko conspiracy theories, out comes the love of corporate Australia and out comes one of the strangest arguments that I've heard in this debate. The argument from Labor is what's eroding trust in democracy isn't taking hundreds, thousands or millions of dollars of donations from the fossil fuel industry, the gambling industry, big pharma, defence and the finance industry—that's not what's eroding trust in politics; it's not taking the dirty money—but what's eroding trust in politics is telling the public about it and asking for change. That would have to be one of the most perverse arguments that I've heard against calling for donations reform, but it came from Labor today in this chamber. Then of course we have this wacko, weird conspiracy theory coming from the coalition, obviously triggering some deep emotional problem they have, if you ever suggest we should take them off the teat of corporate Australia.</span>

Do we need to do it? Of course we do. Right now there's a live discussion about the future of coal and gas. The Greens and millions of Australians are trying to keep it in the ground, and there are 114 live proposals for new or expanded coal or gas projects. Of those, at least 56 have made donations to the major parties—and that's just what is on the public record; it's likely to be much more. </span>

In 2020-21 alone, more than $1.1 million of donations were made to Labor and the coalition by fossil fuel companies. Woodside dropped more than $100,000 to the government of the day. Do you reckon they have a seat at the table when we're talking about climate change? Of course they do, because they bought it. Corporations don't give money to politics because they love democracy. Corporations give money to politics because they want to buy outcomes. They want to buy approvals for their coal and gas projects.</span>

There is one industry that the Greens have not represented on their list. Without doubt it's the worst industry for influence-pedalling. This is an industry that actually owns outright seven teal members of the parliament—six in the House of Representatives and one here in the Senate—all on a mission to drive as many sales for their sponsors as they can. The industry I am talking about, of course, is nature dependent power industry: unreliable, expensive solar and wind. The members of parliament I'm talking about are the teals.</span>

In particular they aim to enable us, to the extent possible, due to the significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted, to get clear and concise answers to provide guidance to those interpreting the government's legislative intent. For that reason, and just for the benefit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record, I remind the chamber and the minister that the official records of parliamentary debates include questions in the Committee of the Whole stage. For the benefit of those in the gallery, that's exactly what we are doing now. We are in the Committee of the Whole stage, asking questions in relation to Labor's industrial relations legislation. They are a vital source of information when it comes to statutory interpretation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  Thank you, Senator Cash. It's good to be with you again on an important piece of legislation. In general terms, can I say that the government's motivation in reforming the better off overall test is that I think pretty much anyone involved in the workplace relations system in Australia at the moment accepts that it's not working as it was intended. What we're trying to do is remove uncertainty that currently attaches to the better off overall test, by allowing the Fair Work Commission to only consider patterns of work that are reasonably foreseeable, meaning the commission will no longer be able to consider unrealistic scenarios. Of course, there are Senate amendments that we put forward that will clarify that the Fair Work Commission must consider whether reasonably foreseeable employees would be better off overall. These changes will ensure that the better off overall test is simplified, while providing strong protections to ensure no worker is worse off. You will remember, Senator Cash, that at the jobs summit both employers and unions agreed that the better off overall test is not operating in the way it was intended. As I said, that's why we are making these changes. The amendments clarify that, when applying the better off overall test, the Fair Work Commission must undertake a global assessment. It must also consider the views of the parties and give primary consideration to any common view about whether the agreement passes the better off overall test as expressed by the employer and bargaining representatives that are employee organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of our amendment that provides that the Fair Work Commission will consider reasonably foreseeable employees, I have already addressed that, but the Fair Work Commission would also have regard to patterns or kinds of work or types of employment only if they are reasonably foreseeable. A further government amendment would provide that, in making this assessment, the commission must have regard to the nature of the enterprise or enterprises to which the agreement relates. If a view is expressed by a reasonable employer, employee or bargaining representative as to whether a working arrangement is reasonably foreseeable, the Fair Work Commission must determine the matter. If the Fair Work Commission makes an amendment to an enterprise agreement to address a concern about meeting the better off overall test, the amendment must be necessary to address the concern and the Fair Work Commission must seek the views of the relevant parties. Additionally, the bill includes a reconsideration process to allow employees, employers or their representatives to seek a reassessment of the better off overall test where particular working arrangements were not considered by the Fair Work Commission when the BOOT was first applied, either because they weren't being engaged in or by omission. If the Fair Work Commission has a concern that an agreement doesn't pass the better off overall test as part of the reconsideration process, it must amend the agreement with retrospective effect if it considers it necessary to address the concern. However, penalty orders won't be available for any contraventions that arise only because of a retrospective variation. Hopefully, that clarifies the intent behind these amendments.</span>

There appears now to be some inconsistency in what you have just advised the chamber of and the press release that was issued on 27 November 2022 by Adam Bandt on behalf of the Australian Greens.

Those changes were reflected in the first draft of the legislation that the minister tabled and spoke to, as I stated, on 27 October. On 27 November 2022, after the deal was done with Senator David Pocock on the amendments now before the chair, a press release was issued by the Australian Greens.

What I'm telling you is what the government's position is and what the law is. The core change we are making here is to require the Fair Work Commission to only have regard to patterns or kinds of work or types of employment that are reasonably foreseeable. The Senate amendments will not change this. In the Senate what we are seeking to do is simply to clarify that the Fair Work Commission must consider whether reasonably foreseeable employees would be better off overall after considering the views of the parties and the nature of the business. This capacity is relevant where there are no employees actually employed under a particular classification in an agreement at the time of approval but they are realistically likely to be in future. Any working arrangements considered by the Fair Work Commission, whether for current or future employees, must be reasonably foreseeable. It's a matter for the Greens what they want to say about this debate. I am not here to say whether they're right or wrong. That's for them to say.</span>

That is in the public. Therefore it is appropriate I ask questions in relation to the deal that has been done so we get an understanding as to the impact of the deal on the legislation. Given the press release and your statements, and given the concerns that have been raised by employers—as I said, there is the original draft; there is the agreement with employers in relation to the better off overall test changes; there are the statements made by Minister Burke in his second reading speech. Then jump forward to but a few days ago, and there is an announcement of a deal. Employers have expressed their disappointment. In particular, there didn't appear to be statements made by Mr Burke in relation to the deal struck that had been with the Australian Greens but for the press release issued by Mr Bandt. Based on the Greens' statement, the issue of prospective employees would remain. I'm still struggling to understand. You're saying they're wrong and you're right. If we could perhaps turn to two case studies, I think the case studies will take us through what actually will be in and out. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first case study is in relation to the 2019 Officeworks case. I know the department and the ministerial advisers will know the Officeworks case. The 2019 Officeworks enterprise agreement provides a compelling example of where process prevails over substance. After objections were lodged by one union, the Fair Work Commission asked Officeworks to provide undertakings of a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite the fact these have nothing to do with the Officeworks business. This is for an agreement which was voted on by more than 80 per cent of eligible employees, with 97 per cent voting in favour of the agreement. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one example of what had become too common when seeking to have enterprise agreements approved. I think that would have been raised with you by employers, because the Officeworks case is one of the most famous cases when it comes to being asked to provide an undertaking about a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite the fact that it had nothing to do with your business, the fact it was voted on by more than 80 per cent of eligible employees, and of that 80 per cent 97 per cent voted in favour. Would the changes proposed by the government to the BOOT mean that the Fair Work Commission would now find this decision differently?</span>

But it is certainly the intention of the government to, if you like, fix the Officeworks-type situation.

Based on the new test that you are applying, and looking at the Officeworks enterprise agreement and the 2019 case, you've just said you can't rule it in or out, and that's the issue that I have. The explanatory memorandum looks like it rules it out. You're saying you can't, that it's at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. This is actually one that you own. It is in your own explanatory memorandum. On that basis, my understanding is that you would no longer need to give an undertaking in particular about, for example, the holding or a liquor licence and work in a cool room despite the enterprise not serving liquor or having a cool room. On that basis, we could all agree that the Officeworks case would be decided differently.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to—and again, this is not a hypothetical; these are actual cases—the Prouds retail employees enterprise agreement, in May 2019, 86 per cent of voting employees voted to support the agreement, but the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the SDA, argued that the agreement should deal with outlets that employ more than 15 employees per week, despite the fact that Prouds never employs more than 15 employees in any one of its stores on a regular basis. It took 16 long months from the date of lodgement with the Fair Work Commission to have that agreement finally approved. The issue the business had with that was that it took them away from creating jobs and left employees worse off while arguing about completely hypothetical situations. Again, similar to the Officeworks case, they had to provide undertakings to the commission in relation to a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite that having nothing to do with their business.</span>

But this is now another agreement and it is in relation to very similar outlets that employ more than 15 employees per week despite the fact that Prouds never employs more than 15 employees in any one of its stores on a regular basis—16 months longer; at that time the business literally says it stopped them from creating jobs and left employees worse off. The whole point there was that they actually had to argue about completely hypothetical situations that did not exist. When we look at clause 28 on page 5 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, again, does the Prouds retail case now fit within that?</span>

In relation to the original bill that was tabled and the amendments I now have in front of me: I need you to take me to what are the key differences in terms of inserting back in 'reasonably foreseeable employee'. My understanding is that, under the bill that was tabled that the minister spoke to, the concept of 'prospective award', 'covered employees' and 'reasonably foreseeable employee' was removed. We're now adding that back in by way of section 524B, with section 12, and all the subsequent sections that add back in 'reasonably foreseeable employee'. I just want to make sure I've got the key differences absolutely certain.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  Thanks, Minister, for your explanations there. Senator Cash has implied there's some kind of inappropriate or nefarious discussion or negotiation underway and that that's somehow illegitimate. I want to reassure people at home who are watching that, since coming here as a senator less than six months ago, I've seen nothing but discussion, compromise, negotiation and often improvement in things; there's nothing untoward about it. Anyone who wants to know what values or issues the Greens took into those discussions with the government can look on our website. There's nothing secret about what we did. Our vote increased at the last election because people want an end to things like pay secrecy. They want a group of senators in here who are making sure that those low-paid retail and hospitality workers don't fall through the bottom of the BOOT. I think it's very important we have been in discussions to improve the test, making sure those young employees who are very powerless are protected. Our sole focus has been on those protections in relation to the BOOT. We've sought to preserve the essential elements of the BOOT, so that new workers, or foreseeable working conditions, don't move workers backwards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to follow that statement with a question to the minister. You've clarified the questions of 'reasonably foreseeable circumstances' and the way in which the BOOT will operate to protect those low-income workers, many of whom are young. I wonder if you could say a little about the reconsideration process and how that will work to also make sure that those workers—young workers, low-paid workers—don't fall through. </span>

I don't know if I made this point earlier in responding to Senator Cash, but you're quite correct that the bill includes what's known as a reconsideration process to allow employees, employers or their representatives to seek a reassessment of the better off overall test, where particular arrangements were not considered by the Fair Work Commission when the better off overall test was first applied, either because they were not being engaged in or by omission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental point here, of course, is that the government does not want to see workers left worse off. If the Fair Work Commission has a concern that an agreement does not pass the better off overall test as part of the reconsideration process, it must amend the agreement with retrospective effect, if it considers it necessary to address the concern. However, penalty orders won't be available for any contraventions that only arise because of a retrospective variation. Really, the intention of the reconsideration process is to permit adjustments to the bargained outcome only to the extent necessary to address a concern about the better off overall test because of a working arrangement that was not initially considered. The intention is not to interfere with the working arrangements for employees who are not affected by the concerns or unnecessarily disrupt the operations of the enterprise. The Business Council and the ACTU both support a better off overall test reconsideration process for enterprise agreements.</span>

Overall, what we're seeking to do is simplify the process and remove unnecessary complexity for workers and employers by simplifying the agreement preapproval requirements. As to why we're doing this, there's consensus that the preapproval requirements for enterprise agreements are onerous, complex and unnecessarily prescriptive. This can be a disincentive to bargain and can sometimes have significant consequences for employers and workers where an agreement was been reached but cannot be approved because of a procedural error during the course of the bargaining process. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to what the amendment involves and the proposal involves, it would replace certain preapproval requirements with a broad requirement that the agreement has been genuinely agreed to by relevant employees. A government amendment retains the existing requirement that employers must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of the agreement and the effect of the terms are explained to employees in an appropriate manner, taking into account their particular circumstances and needs. The Fair Work Commission must also be satisfied that the employees requested to approve the agreement by voting for it have a sufficient interest in the terms of the agreement and are sufficiently representative having regard to the employees the agreement is expressed to cover. The Fair Work Commission will issue a statement of principles on genuine agreement to provide guidance to employers on how to ensure an enterprise agreement has been genuinely agreed to by employees.</span>

That document, when it's issued, will play a significant role in ensuring the changes do not erode employee safeguards. A government amendment also provides that, before an employer requests employees approve a multi-enterprise agreement by voting for it, the employer must obtain written agreement to the making of the request from each bargaining representative for the agreement that is an employee organisation. The government wants to ensure that employers are not unreasonably prevented from putting agreements to a vote, and that's why a further proposed government amendment would permit the Fair Work Commission to order, on application by a bargaining representative, that an employer be permitted to put a multi-enterprise agreement to a vote where employee organisations' failure to provide their agreement is unreasonable in the circumstances.</span>

For instance, if a majority vote of employees at a workplace resulted in the employer being brought to a multiemployer agreement, that would not in itself demonstrate genuine agreement or opposition to that agreement from the employer.</span>

I was recognising your experience in this area. What I can also direct you to in the revised explanatory memorandum is in, I think, the next paragraph from the one you were reading from. So, paragraph 1119, about halfway down, it makes the point that 'protected industrial action taken by the employers/employees during bargaining for the agreement would not amount to coercion. The employer, having requested its employees to vote to approve the agreement, could be taken into consideration as could any unprotected industrial action taken by the employees.'</span>

I mean, whether we're talking about employers or employees, given that the current legislation that your government presided over allowed for protected and industrial action to occur, albeit with significant constraints around it, the mere fact that that is provided for in the legislation would suggest pretty strongly to me that that does not amount to coercion. What the explanatory memorandum is trying to say is that coercion could, for example, be unprotected industrial action, unlawful intimidation or threats. I've been reminded that the leading case on the meaning of coercion in this context is the Esso decision, and that found, essentially, that coercion needs to involve negation of choice and the use of unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable means.</span>

Just so you're completely aware, whenever you say that you don't insult me, but you do insult former Prime Minister Gillard and former Prime Minister Rudd, because it is your regime. No-one here is insulted by the comments that you are making. We didn't have the numbers in the previous Senate. We relied on you. You opposed everything, including our changes to the BOOT. Every time you want to say that going forward, please note that none of us are insulted, but I'm quite sure that in insulting Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard, given it is Labor's Fair Work Act, there will be many on your side who are disappointed. </span>

Yes, the Fair Work Act was introduced by the Rudd-Gillard governments. As time goes on it needs improvement, just like every piece of legislation. The point I'm making is that over the course of this debate, both last night and today, you have suggested that there are things in the amendments that we're putting forward that are wrong or immoral or will do this or that, when in many cases they are picking up concepts that were contained in the legislation that existed when you were the minister. You did attempt to make amendments to the Act while were you the minister, many of which would have actually made workers' position worse off. I am very proud of the fact that we resisted those. Now that we're in government we're about trying to improve this act from where it began under the Rudd-Gillard governments, from where it was under your government, to where it needs to be to make sure that workers in this country get a decent pay rise and we can lift productivity in businesses as well. </span>

Is it then to actually make explicitly clear, given the wording of amendment, the Fair Work Commission must disregard anything done and the effect of anything done by a person other than one of the employers who bargained for the agreement? The effect is to make it explicitly clear that anything done by an employee or their union under the umbrella of industrial action is permitted when negotiating an agreement?</span>

What was the rationale behind including the section, given what you have just said, other than the government effectively telling Australians that to get what you want in the workplace, all you need to do is threaten industrial action, and that is the whole point? What is the rationale behind adding or inserting section 2AA?</span>

I don't see any need for this particular section other than you do want to make it clear that anything done by an employee or their union in undertaking the application of section 186(2)(b), the Fair Work Commission does not need to take into consideration, unless it is one of the employers who bargained for the agreement. You have confirmed, therefore, that proposing or threatening to take industrial action that would financially cripple a small or family business or a smaller business to force them to sign the agreement is actually not coercion and therefore allowed.</span>

That existing provision provides that in order to approve a multi-enterprise agreement, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that:</span>

There is no reference in the current section 186(2)(b) to employees or to unions; it's focused on employers. That's why 186(2AA) also refers to employers. If, as I think you're suggesting, this new provision were to also refer to employees, it would be completely meaningless, because it connects back to 186(2)(b), which is all about employers.</span>

That's exactly where I wanted to get to: what is the minimum number? For very obvious reasons, when an employer or employee reads this, there is no explanation anywhere in the bill. You say that the word 'some' has its usual legal meaning. That's great, but they don't have a time to grab a book and look up the usual legal meaning in Australia of 'some'. I want to confirm because of statutory interpretation. This is very important and has been raised with me across the board. More than some means more than one? This is the exact point that employers have been raising with me. Whilst there is no minimum number, you are saying one employee alone will not suffice, based on the usual legal meaning of the word 'some' for the employees covered? That's the exact issue that's been raised. Would it require more than one?</span>

What I'm talking about is the usual meaning of 'some'. People use that word every day in Australian life, and I think they know that 'some' is more than 'one'. But let's remember that what we're talking about here is cooperative workplace agreements. There are obviously a range of different streams of agreements being provided for by this legislation. What we're talking about here is the cooperative workplace agreement where there is agreement between an employer and a union that a particular workplace should have its terms and conditions governed by a cooperative agreement, so the entire basis of this stream of bargaining is that there is agreement between an employer and a union in which there are at least some of the employees. Really the point of it to say that not every employee at that business needs to be represented by a union but at least some of them are.</span>

It will give people satisfaction that, based on that answer, 'some' does not equate to 'one'. That actually does clear that up. It could be two, but it is not one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues that has been raised both at Senate estimates and in relation to the inquiry—as you are aware, we just have not had that opportunity to properly go through any of this—is in relation to the powers of the Fair Work Ombudsman or, should I say, the current powers of the Australian Building and Construction Commission under the relevant act that transfer over to the Fair Work Ombudsman. I want to now take you through—and it's going to take some time—each power, because we received something back from the department that had words to the effect of minimal difference, or no substantive difference. So, we'll be going through all that as well. But perhaps, in the first instance, I could turn to some basic questions. Senator Lambie, in a question on notice, asked: 'I just have one follow-up question, because we're on the ABCC, and it has a tremendous amount of powers. What's the difference between their powers and what's been passed over to the Ombudsman and Fair Work? What's the difference?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Sheehan replied, 'We took a question on notice at estimates to put it in a simple table form', and then we have the simple table form. I've now gone through the simple table form and, as I said, it will take us some time, because we're actually going to—and I'm saying this to give a heads-up to the department that somebody probably with knowledge of the transfer of powers may well be required. In the first instance, can I confirm that, in relation to the transfer of some of the powers of the ABCC to the Fair Work Ombudsman, the Fair Work Ombudsman will not have the ability to make submissions in Fair Work Commission proceedings?</span>

We've provided them with $70 million over the next four years. These resources will ensure there's no shortfall in workplace relations regulation within the industry after the ABCC has been abolished. The ABCC's legal cases will be transferred to the Fair Work Ombudsman for them to manage independent of government.</span>

I genuinely did not ask that question. The question I asked was about you saying 'limited ability'. There is a current power for the Fair Work Ombudsman, according to your evidence, where they have a 'limited ability' to intervene in relation to stand down and right-of-entry.

You have stated that you believe the Fair Work Ombudsman does have a limited ability to intervene in relation to stand down and right-of-entry matters, but what we have also determined is that the Fair Work Ombudsman is not required to intervene in Fair Work Commission matters, that it is merely a discretion that the Fair Work Ombudsman has—depending on their workload, to be fair.</span>

You are abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. You have key figures from the department here who have provided a table. It is a very, very simple question, and I would ask—don't take it on notice; we are going to be here until two o'clock—with all due respect that you find me the section in the Fair Work Act please that directly refers to unlawful picketing.</span>

In September 2022, only after the ABCC Commissioner intervened, Dean Riley was denied to renew his federal entry permit. For the benefit of those listening in, Dean Riley is a man who used homophobic slurs against a safety inspector. Again, can I confirm there is no obligation on the Fair Work Ombudsman, unlike on the Australian Building and Construction Commission Commissioner, to intervene?</span>

In May 2021, assistant secretary of the New South Wales branch of the CFMMEU Michael Greenfield only discontinued his application for a right of entry permit because of the submission of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. For the record, in the Botany Cranes case, Mr Greenfield was found to have said to the managing director, 'If I were you, I would effing sign it'—his threat—'What do you think will happen to you?' This was followed up the next day by, 'If you sign the EBA, we will leave your sites alone.' In a case like this, where there is clear coercion, as shown in a court of law, the Fair Work Ombudsman is not obliged to make a submission against the right of entry permit application; they merely have the discretion to, based on their workload?</span>

What I have said, and I think it has been repeated here today by my colleague, Senator Watt, the Fair Work Ombudsman will be well resourced over the next four years. There's almost $70 million that we've put there. This includes an additional 80 staff. These resources will ensure there is no shortfall in workplace relations regulation within the industry after the ABCC has been abolished.</span>

My question was, was this power available to the Australian Building and Construction Commission? To preface that, I started at the beginning by saying that we had asked a number of questions in relation to the transfer of powers from the ABCC to the Fair Work Ombudsman. I'm not interested in what the Fair Work Commission can or can't do. That's the current rule; I understand. I'm talking about the fact that today or tomorrow morning we will formally abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. They operate under a specific piece of legislation. I'm asking the questions very genuinely. As I said to Senator Watt last night and again this morning, these are important questions of statutory interpretation. So I'm only dealing with the powers the Australian Building and Construction Commission had, and whether or not they transfer over to the Fair Work Ombudsman. What other bodies may or may not be able to do is the current situation. My questions are in relation to the transfer of powers from the ABCC under the BCIIP Act to the Fair Work Ombudsman. </span>

I'm going to go back to the first one. With respect to employers within the building and construction industry, can the minister detail what powers were available—not the Fair Work Commission, not any other body—to the Fair Work Ombudsman to take action in relation to industrial action or threats thereof on a site, and other unrelated or related sites, if all subcontractors did not have a union endorsed enterprise bargaining agreement and was this a power available to the ABCC?</span>

Again, there is an entire industry watching these proceedings. They would genuinely like to know what exposure they have to the likes of John Setka, the most militant union in Australia, the construction division of the CFMMEU. This is genuine questioning. You're abolishing a body, and that's your decision—I accept it's an election commitment—but there is also a transfer of powers or not. You have said on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record, 'We are confident that there are no gaps'. To date we've discovered there are some gaps. Minister, with all due respect, answers such as, 'We are confident we've given them money'—that's not the line of questioning I'm going down. We are going to go through each power they had and whether or not it transferred over. I'm going to have to assume, if you cannot give me an answer—because you have got advisers there—it is going to be no. Then later today we're going to have to go through what you mean when you say you are confident that there are no gaps.</span>

We will need to take a break to get someone to come into this place—I don't care who it is—who is actually going to inform the Senate. You knew you were coming in here today. I'm quite sure the minister's office, the department and your office knew there would be a line of questioning in relation to the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Do you honestly think it is acceptable? There are people in the gallery here today who are witnessing a minister within the government either refusing or being unable to provide the Australian Senate answers to incredibly simple questions.</span>

I'm now exploring the statement that you have made to the building and construction industry across Australia. They employ in excess of 1.1 million employees. Over 400,000 small businesses rely on them. They contribute about nine per cent annually to Australia's GDP. You have no answers in relation to some of the most basic questions, which either the minister's office or the department should have anticipated. Again, it will be a very, very long three hours, because I will go through each one of them. As I said, what I'm reading out are powers that the ABCC had. I'm asking you—it's a simple yes or no—has this power transferred over to the Fair Work Ombudsman? The answer, 'It's in the Fair Work Act,' is not helping anybody, so we're going to go through this again. </span>

We know your position on the ABCC, and as you pointed out today, you've acknowledged our position on the ABCC, which we took the election. I did actually have a look up at the gallery when you mentioned that. I do see some familiar faces up there, and I get a sense that a lot of them are here because they want to see this bill passed. We know that you've been opposed to this legislation from the beginning, as you are entitled to be, but stop the lectures. I'm answering your question, I'm happy to sit here for as long as you want and I'm providing the answers that are required.</span>

Minister, you are actually from Queensland. You're a senator representing Queensland. There has been a 50 per cent spike in the number of new investigations launched into alleged wrongdoing in the building sector in Queensland, more than any other state or territory. The militant construction union, the CFMMEU, was hit with 88 per cent of the $3 million in fines for breaches of the Fair Work Act imposed by the soon-to-be-defunct Australian Building and Construction Commission. Of the $5.1 million in fines the ABCC imposed in Queensland since it was restarted in December 2016, $4.4 million—or 87 per cent of these—were against the CFMMEU or its officials. How is this behaviour going to be dealt with in the bill?</span>

Could you fill us in on how this bill will assist that group of workers, people for whom this bill holds great potential to improve their lives?

Australian women are amongst the most educated in the OECD, yet the gender pay gap is currently 14.1 per cent, which means women earn $263.90 less than men per week on average. The total remuneration gender pay gap, based on the Workplace Gender Equality Agency data, is 22.8 per cent, meaning men earn almost $26,000 a year more than women. As you can see, there is a real urgency in how we address this and the need to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To promote gender equality and close the gender pay gap we need to change the law. That is the reality. In the design of these reforms we have deliberately focused on the needs of lower paid and feminised workforces, and we believe the bill we have put forward best deals with those issues. As Senator David Pocock has pointed out in this chamber, some of the very workers who put their health and safety on the line to guide us through the pandemic are struggling, particularly with the cost of living that people are confronting at the moment. That's workers in health care, aged care, disability support, early childhood education and care and other care in community sectors. Part of the discussion we had last night was about attracting worker to these industries as well, because they are areas where we are suffering from a significant labour shortage at the moment. Keeping those workers and attracting new workers to those industries are going to be much easier if they are better paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Work in these industries is undervalued because of unfair and discriminatory assumptions about the value of the work and the skill required to do the job. The undervaluation is one of the biggest causes of the gender pay gap, and our reforms take a number of key steps to address it. Another key cause of the gender pay gap is that our laws are outdated and don't support workers with caring responsibilities well enough. We will take a number of historic steps to address these issues: (1) changing the objects of the Fair Work Act to include gender equality, (2) fixing gender pay equity and creating new expert panels, (3) fixing bargaining for low-paid feminised sectors through our new support stream, (4) banning pay secrecy, (5) stamping out sexual harassment and (6) providing greater access to flexible work. That's what the focus of this bill is. That's why it is important. That's why it's urgent that it be passed. That's why the government have made it a priority since we were elected.</span>

The fact is that this could have also been dealt with under the state and federal awards. You could actually move the wages there if you really wanted to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Senator David Pocock has said really concerns me because, in a small crossbench meeting that he had with my adviser, with Malcolm Roberts and with some others on the crossbench, he admitted that this bill was being rushed through. He has said that publicly—that there hadn't been enough time for consultation to address it and that, to pull out these things to do with the ABCC and multi-enterprise bargaining, further consultation was to happen. It's quite interesting what he says. He talked about how the motion to extend the committee hearing date last week wasn't passed. It wasn't going to get passed in this chamber; it was blocked by Labor, and it was blocked by the Greens. You didn't want to extend the consultation time for the committee to actually hear more about the IR bill. So Senator Pocock's comments are very interesting. He said, after the motion was defeated and after it was clear the bill would be voted on this week, that he did the research. But we're only talking about last week to this week that he did the research. These are his words, not mine. Then he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I knuckled down and got to work and tried to get across this issue as best I could to be able to make a decision and vote on behalf of the people of the ACT …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the ACT, but he admits that he wasn't really across it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ABCC came up in this chamber, we actually spent three months plus on it. We spoke to unions, we spoke to the government, we spoke to advisers, we spoke to businesses—everyone. It took us that long just to get our heads across the ABCC and the impact it has on the construction industry. You can't tell me that a rookie senator in this place, who's dealing with all the other legislation, has got his head around and knows what's happening in this industry. This has been pushed by Labor. I don't know what deals you've done with him, but there's no way in the wide world that he can actually be across this and know exactly what's going on. Not only that; you have Labor, and you have the Liberal-National coalition, but the fact is that we on the crossbench are not beholden to any of the political parties. We actually do represent the over 33 per cent of Australians who voted for us in this last election. To push this legislation through is disgusting; you have not really given big business the chance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to the hearing last week, and I asked some questions. I asked the Fair Work Commissioner, 'Have you ever run a business? Have you ever employed anyone?' They looked at me, stupid. Then they had to say, 'No, I've only been a public servant.' You have really only listened to them. I asked a question about the Public Service. I said, 'Do you realise that right across your own board and The Public Service you don't have enterprise bargaining, because if you work under the E4 or E5, for instance, in one government department, whether it be Defence or another government department, people are paid different wages. That's something I would like the minister to answer: does the bill deal with the Public Service? You're dealing with the private sector. You're telling the private sector what they should be doing. What have you got in the bill to cover the Public Service? </span>

                    </a>  I understand that, and I will get an answer for that. In my experience with Senator David Pocock—I'm certainly not going to attack him, like you did—I found someone who is diligent, who is thorough, and who applies himself to the task. He obviously was engaged in discussion with the government and made the decision to support this legislation because he thinks that this is going to deliver for the Australian people, and it's also going to be the focus from our government of getting wages moving again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bemusing thing for me is that I hear people say, 'We all want to get wages moving.' I'd be sceptical about the opposition doing that, given their record in government, but when we actually put something forward to do something about it, it's not the right thing. How do you think Australian workers are feeling about that now? For ten years, low wages were a deliberate design feature of the previous government. But, now that we have a government that wants to do something about it and has put forward legislation to do something about, people are saying, 'This isn't the right thing to do.' No-one has put forward any other alternative. This is what we put forward as the government. I've run through some of the reasons we think it will be successful, particularly targeting some of those lower-paid industries and feminised workforces, which we think are so important, and those people who are doing it tough. That's the legislation that we've put forward. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important issue, and the Albanese Labor government wants to close the loopholes that are undermining job security and wages. Too many Australians are stuck in insecure work, and that is dragging down wages. In my travels through regional Queensland, I see the prevalence of casual work or labour hire and the undermining of communities that that causes. People are waiting for a phone call to know whether they have work that day, which has a debilitating impact just on surviving. Can I get a home loan? People in the casualised workforce are treated differently.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once upon a time it was that people in those insecure jobs were students or people looking for some extra pocket money. But now, too often, it's people who are trying to support a family, to run a household, or to get ahead in life. When we think about that, it's the pressures of being part of a family. The rent doesn't operate on a casual basis. The mortgage doesn't operate on a casual basis. They're things that you are responsible for every week or month, depending on what your commitments are. People in insecure work can't take sick leave, can't get a loan, can't get ahead. And there are too many rorts and loopholes that the previous government allowed to flourish. Nearly 27 million employees, or 23.5 per cent of all employees, are casual. These are workers with no paid leave entitlements. Of the 1.3 million low-paid employees in 2021, nearly 60 per cent were employed on a casual basis and around 704,000 casual employees have had regular work with their employer. Nearly two-thirds of these have had regular work with their employer for more than 12 months. It shows you the way these people are being treated.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, it is something that is important. This bill will focus on improving job security and gender equality by including both concepts in the objects of the Fair Work Act. Part 4 would amend section 3 of division 2 of the Fair Work Act to introduce the promotion of job security and gender equality into the object of the Fair Work Act. In addition, part 4 would amend section 134 of the Fair Work Act to include the promotion of job security and gender equality in the modern awards objective. It would also amend section 284 to include the promotion of gender equality in the minimum wages objective. We are also making bargaining more accessible to those who've traditionally been shut out of the benefits of enterprise bargaining, including workers in low-paid and feminised sectors of the workforce, of which you're well aware.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Job security is at the heart of the government's agenda, and this bill puts job security at the heart of the Fair Work Act by making job security an object of the Fair Work Act. This is more than just a symbolic change. It will now be a legislative expectation that the Fair Work Commission have regard to job security when performing relevant functions. We think that is a very important change for those impacted.</span>

Let me remind you that it was actually One Nation that pushed for people who are casual, if they've been with the business for 12 months or more, to then have the right to go to the employer and say, 'We want to be classified as full-time employment.' That was One Nation that did that. Aren't you aware of it, Minister? That was actually addressed, so that if people want to move casual to full-time employment they have every right to do it now. But a lot of people wish to stay as casuals because of the pay they're getting, the higher rate of pay that they have at the time. That was something that One Nation did. So, we do care about the workers out there. We do understand the stresses and strains they are going through.</span>

What consultation was undertaken and what consideration was taken on whether they can afford the enterprise bargaining agreements that larger organisations have agreed to and that will flow on to them, because 'like minded'? What consultations have been undertaken?</span>

A very thorough consultation process was undertaken before the introduction, meeting with key business peaks on multiple occasions as well as the ACTU and many business groups representing single interests, such as: Clubs Australia; the Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association; the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association; the manufacturing and insulation association; individual employers, such as Qantas DP World and Team Global Express, formally Toll; the National Women's Alliances, including representatives from Migrant Women in Business, Harmony Alliance, the National Rural Women's Coalition, Women with Disabilities Australia and YWCA Canberra; academics with a focus on workplace practices and law, including Professor Anthony Forsyth from RMIT and Professor Crystal from the University of Sydney; written submissions ahead of the Jobs and Skills Summit, including from peak business groups—34 were sought and 20 received; the Committee on Industrial Legislation, including business representatives from the peak body; the Business Council of Australia; the Housing Industry Association; the National Farmers Federation; the Master Builders, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, representing COSBOA; the Australian Industry Group; Australian Business Lawyers &amp; Advisers; and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In terms of consultation on government amendments: since the introduction on the 27th, the minister's office and the department had at least a dozen further meetings with employers and employee groups to discuss concerns, including with the Franchise Council of Australia, business peaks, BHP, Clubs Australia, Wesfarmers, Woolworths and Coles. Obviously, the Senate inquiry was held as well; it had five days of hearings. My understanding is that there was only a one-day hearing into the bill re-establishing the ABCC.</span>

Just listening it to it, there was Woolworths, Qantas and all these others. My question was, basically, that if something is at the smaller end, can they afford the enterprise-bargaining agreements of the larger businesses? It's just ridiculous to say that you've had all these meetings with these people when the question is, 'Have you actually consulted with these businesses and can they actually afford it?'</span>

So my question, again is—and I'll repeat it: have you had any feedback from businesses that are saying they're actually going to have trouble affording this? Will it affect their businesses? Has any business told you that this will impact on them and that it will possibly force them to shut down their business or take it overseas?</span>

But I think that the focus and the important thing for smaller businesses to understand is that for cooperative work places, which is where we think small businesses would more than likely end up, it's entirely voluntary. It allows small businesses to opt in to an agreement without having to incur the costs of negotiating it. It gives them access to the benefits of bargaining for productivity, simplicity and flexibility that currently only bigger businesses can access. That is what we feel will be appropriate, and we think that would also be cost-effective at the same time.</span>

Did you actually take this into consideration: if you're going to increase wages—and that's what you want to do, to increase wages—there's also a plus-plus-plus on top of that. So it's not just wages; enterprise bargaining means that they could bargain for four days a week or they could bargain for extra holidays. This is all added cost to the employer. But if they actually do increase their wages, have you considered having negotiations or talks with the states? What this is going to do is put added cost onto businesses with payroll tax in the states. Have you taken this into consideration, and have you actually tried to negotiate with the states to look at the payroll tax?</span>

You could actually drive it up, and instead of putting more employees on, you're actually going to reduce the staffing levels. Has this been taken into consideration? That's what I want to ask—not about consultation. Was this taken into consideration in the bill that if you're going to drive up wages you're actually going to create unemployment, because businesses will not be able to afford the extra they're going to pay in payroll tax. Each state varies in the amount of payroll tax that businesses pay. </span>

It was not part of this; you're not interested; you're just passing the buck to the states. They deal with payroll tax. If you put out a bill like this, you have to take into consideration the impact it's going to have on businesses, whether they can afford it or not. I will tell you now, this is going to have an impact on businesses that will have to reduce their staff because they won't be able to afford the overheads and the costs. This is something I have been on about for years and years, about the unfair payroll tax which is destroying workers. They are not employing more staff because they can't afford it with that unfair tax. Tell me also, when an agreement is not reached, can protected industrial action commence?</span>

You haven't really clearly defined what the similarities are going to be. Does it mean that in producing, whether you're retail or whether you're a restaurant or a manufacturer, or whether you box in the same way, are you in the same shopping centre? You haven't defined what similar entities are. That's not in the bill. You have left it open-ended. Can you explain that part to me? Please define, so businesses out there know what enterprise bargaining agreement they're going to be tied up with another supposedly like-minded business. </span>

You've left everyone out there wondering what the hell is going to happen here. What I see written over this bill is union, union, union. This is payback from the Labor Party to the unions for all the funding and all the money that they have given you. This is basically about giving the unions the right to walk into businesses and with enterprise bargaining say, 'Sign up here'. I can see it now. They're going to walk into the business and say to the employee, 'Do you want higher wages?' Of course they will. Who is stupid enough to say, 'No, we don't'? When they get the agreement, they all want higher wages. 'Listen, mate, you sign up to the unions and we're going to go and fight for you for higher wages.' That is written all over this bill. Union, union, union. </span>

There are pages and pages of amendments. Even the government amendments are nine pages. You know what that tells me? If you were to go and buy a car and you had all these defects in the car, nine pages—and that's not just Labor; this is the Liberal Party, the Greens, David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie, all these amendments—'Listen, with this car, we're actually going to make changes here; these are the defects,' you know what it'd tell me? You're buying a frigging lemon. That's what it would tell me, and that's exactly what this bill tells me—that you have not researched it properly. You're rushing it through this parliament. You've got a rookie senator that you've talked into supporting this bill, and it's a real shame.</span>

A lot of businesses are actually paying their workers above the award just to get good staff. They want to hold onto them, so they are paying a lot of them above the award and all the other agreements—plus, plus, plus—that they want. But I'll also tell you what you're going to tie up here, because I've been a small-business person most of my life. You're going to have enterprise bargaining right across the board with a lot of these workers as well, instead of a single enterprise agreement with the worker. A lot of the workers are no-hopers, the ones that do not do a decent day's work. If you've got one person who works their guts out and does a good job and the other ones beside them are on their phone all day and don't work, productivity is down the bloody drain. You're going to tie them up into getting the same pay, the same rights, the same everything. That is going to really upset the worker who does his job and takes pride in his work and productivity, and that's what's going to happen as well.</span>

I say to you, clean up your own backyard before you start telling private enterprise how to run their businesses and whether they can afford it or not. You're going to drive a lot of these businesses into the ground who can't afford it, and you're pushing this onto them. You are actually going to create unemployment with this bill. It is ill thought out. It is not dealing with the real issues. There is not enough consultation. You're going to get rid of the ABCC because it suits the CFMMEU to get rid of it. They won't have to be answerable to anyone. They are nothing but thugs—not all; I'm talking about the officials—on these building sites that have destroyed small businesses. It has driven up the cost on these building sites by 30 per cent, and that's going to be the same effect again. Yet you think it's a good thing?</span>

When only 32 or 33 per cent of Australians voted for Labor, you don't have a mandate at all—not at all. The system got you the seats in here that give you government. That's not a mandate to me. A mandate is 50.1 per cent of the vote. You didn't get that. I don't believe you're listening to the Australian people.</span>

More importantly, I see a bill that is designed to ensure people do get that wage rise, and that is what we are absolutely dedicated to doing. That is the focus of what we want to achieve through this. Again, I mentioned earlier that everyone tries to claim they're for wage rises, but then they keep coming up with a thousand excuses why they don't support them. We are unashamedly in favour of them. I think one of the clearest memories for the Australian people during the election campaign was the now Prime Minister holding up a dollar, and that resonated with the Australian people. I have no doubt that there is support across the community. There is obviously the support in this chamber, and that's the way our democracy works, Senator Hanson.</span>

She has the media release; I could just refer you to the Geelong Manufacturing Council's media release of 23 November 2022. Minister, are you aware of a request by the Geelong Manufacturing Council to exclude the manufacturing sector from aspects of this bill, including the multi-employer bargaining provisions?</span>

We did go through this yesterday with Senator Watt. The answer, though, again, is: it is ultimately at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. Senator Sarah Henderson has just joined us in the chamber. Senator Henderson, just so, for your constituents, you understand what the answer is, the answer to the first question—does the shoe manufacturing business EMU Australia, headquartered in Geelong, have a common interest with Boundary Bend Olives, a manufacturer of olive oil based in North Geelong?—is: that is a decision at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.</span>

Let's see if we can get some certainty for the next group of employers that have put forward this question: does the manufacturer Backwell IXL, based in South Geelong, which manufactures a range of products, including homewares and steel fabrication, and which employs around 60 people, have a common interest with the oil refinery Viva Energy, based in North Geelong, which employs about 700 people?</span>

This is the first time I'm asking this particular question. So, Senator Watt did not give me an answer last night. You have now stated that you are aware that certain industries did make representations to government in relation to potential carve outs. You said you've got one for me—mining and resources. You said you're not aware of manufacturers putting any request in to government. You've said you'll go away on notice, and the good news is that we're open-ended tonight, so we'll be able to get that information if not shortly then after question time in relation to the other sectors that approached the government and asked for a carve out. This is information that you've given me that I'm now questioning you on. So, I ask again: did the department provide any advice to the government about how the mining or the mining and resources sector could be carved out or excluded from the single-interest multi-employer bargaining stream?</span>

I accept that you take advice from shamans, spiritual healers, magicians, dog walkers and dog trainers regarding costings for your regulatory impact statement. But, again, I didn't put the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> to Minister Watt last night, unless we were sitting at 1 am, which I don't believe we were. So, again, regarding the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, on the issues raised by Mike Henry on behalf of BHP, which have also been raised on behalf of Rio Tinto, the evidence that was given in relation to the rationale behind the government carving out the civil construction industry from multi-employer bargaining was that there is a high use of enterprise bargaining agreements. As I said, Mike Henry, on behalf of BHP, would argue there is a very high use of enterprise agreements in the mining and resources industry on the East coast. Why did the government ignore the concerns of those industries when it was prepared to carve out the civil construction industry?</span>

How can Geelong manufacturers be given certainty that they won't be placed in this situation and forced to close if required or compelled to bargain with the likes of Viva Energy in Geelong?</span>

I have literally got off the phone from a Geelong manufacturer—the Chief Executive Officer and proprietor—who has said to me that if this business was required to bargain with Viva Energy and match the terms and conditions that are offered by Viva Energy to its employees, which include up to two years of severance pay, then that business will be forced to close because it cannot carry that level of contingent liability. Again, this is not a hypothetical.

These laws are not in effect as yet, but if these laws are passed, as I assume they will be, and Geelong manufacturers are required and compelled under your laws—they are a manufacturer which employs more than 20 people. If they are required and compelled to bargain with Viva Energy—please provide this chamber with the advice as to how Geelong manufacturers can be given certainty that they won't be placed in this situation and be forced to close. The response that you gave before is totally inadequate and does not address my question. I would ask you to address my question.</span>

In terms of a single interest test, if an employer does not want to bargain for a single interest multi-enterprise agreement there are factors the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied of before granting an authorisation, such as the majority of employees must want to bargain; if the business is in a franchise, the business is reasonably comparable with other businesses to be covered by the agreement and the employers have clearly identifiable common interests; and it is not contrary to the public interest. Again, that's a level of information for you. But I won't answer the hypothetical situation that you're putting to me.</span>

These are real-life fears in the Geelong community about Geelong manufacturing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government inherited a situation where, when we came into government in 2013, Ford had announced it was closing—on Labor's watch. We came into government in 2013 when Geelong was on its knees. Manufacturers had no confidence in the future. We worked extremely hard as a coalition to turn the economy around locally. Now we have a vibrant manufacturing sector, which is also working well together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, under these laws, your government is proposing to pit manufacturer against manufacturer, to create a war, an industrial war, in Geelong. We are one of the most successful manufacturing regions in the country. The fact that you, under your laws, cannot provide Geelong manufacturers—or, in fact, any manufacturer around this country— with any guidance is a disgrace. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not posing hypothetical questions, and, with respect, your answer was pathetic. It shows how little this government cares about manufacturing. It is ridiculous that your government and you as the responsible minister, the acting minister, cannot tell Australians or AKD Softwoods—an incredible company based in Colac, supported heavily by the former coalition government, which has grown exponentially and is now the largest producer of softwood timber in this country, with more than 1,000 employees—if this business is in the same geographical area as Bulla Dairy Foods, which is located three kilometres away, in Connor Street, Colac? That is absurd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would invite you to provide manufacturers in Victoria, including in the Geelong region, with the certainty that they require so that they know that perhaps their futures are assured. Right now, in the offices of the Geelong Manufacturing Council and in the offices of every manufacturer in Geelong and across Victoria, and, frankly, across this nation, there is deep fear. So, again, I ask you to address the question. And, if the answer is, 'This is a matter for the Fair Work Commission,' then that's fine, but please address the question.</span>

They've learned absolutely zero from the last election campaign. If Geelong was going so well, how'd you get voted out? What happened there? If Geelong was going so well, how did you get voted out?

I saw that Minister Husic put forward the legislation yesterday implementing our election policies. I am absolutely confident that the manufacturing sector in Australia will be very, very well supported by this government. We have big plans that we took to the election and we intend to deliver on them. And I'm sure the manufacturers of Geelong will be very excited by that. </span>

Sections 54 and 55 of the BCIIP Act—the ABCC will take action to seek an injunction and bring prosecutions seeking penalties on behalf of an affected contractor. The ABCC could also be required to ensure competition laws are upheld and would refer any related issues to the ACCC for investigation. The code required that employers maintain compliance with competition laws at all times, and non-observance is sanctionable. That was under the BCIIP Act. The act is being abolished. What is now the difference between what was under the BCIIP Act in terms of what I read out and what is now the power of the Fair Work Ombudsman?</span>

You had previously said you were confident that there was no gap or difference between the ABCC and the Fair Work Ombudsman and the powers that could be exercised. You have now gone to saying, if I understand you correctly, there is a difference, so they won't have the same powers and they'll have only the powers of the ABCC that the government believes are not excessive. I'm trying to explore. We were at the stage where you were confident there were no gaps, but now you're actually saying there are gaps. Can I get you to take me through, in particular in relation to gathering of evidence, what powers you believe are excessive, just so I can get a better understanding of that.</span>

As you'd be well aware, the now government has been of the view for a long time that the ABCC is ineffective and was a waste of taxpayer money. It has been a disaster for productivity in the sector and did little to address exploitation of workers through wage theft and sham contracting, which has been allowed to run rife, with often devastating consequences. The government stands for safe, fair workplaces for all Australians. Under our government the Fair Work Ombudsman will enforce the Fair Work Act across all industries. Offensive behaviour has absolutely no role in our society. Criminal conduct on worksites is wrong, and the police should and will continue to take appropriate action where it concerns. The ABCC, I would point out, has never had a role in enforcing criminal laws.</span>

The talking points don't answer the question. The question was specific. You've admitted that there are gaps, even though your evidence earlier this morning was that you were confident there were no gaps. I'm happy to accept the change in evidence. There are now gaps. I'm assuming that you're of the opinion it was merely the vibe of the ABCC that was excessive, but the issue does become that there is a difference. You've stated there is a difference. I am asking you what powers you thought were excessive. I'm happy for you to come back to that, because we had an agreement that I would cede time to Senator Barbara Pocock.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I'm willing to wager that most Australians won't know what the ABCC is. But an issue which has had no discussion, in the seven or nine hours of questioning that we've had so far, is from two sections in the bill, in relation to sexual harassment. Now, 53 per cent of Australian women will experience sexual harassment in their lives and it's an issue that really does deserve some discussion. How will this bill deal with this epidemic of sexual harassment? More than half of us are going to have the experience, including many in this workplace, and a third of Australians—men and women—in the last five years have had harassment experiences. So can we please hear a little bit about something that actually matters to most Australians?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—Assistant Minister for Education, Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  Senator B Pocock, I thank you for your interest in this area, and I acknowledge your longstanding history of working in this space as well. I think it is an important aspect of this legislation. Stamping out workplace sexual harassment is central to achieving safe, productive and gender-equitable workplaces. That is what the government is committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government's laws there was no express prohibition on sexual harassment under the Fair Work Act and stop-sexual-harassment orders were only available to some workers. We will fix these issues. Firstly, we will broaden the scope of stop-sexual-harassment orders to make clear that the Fair Work Commission has the power to make orders preventing sexual harassment for all workers, including sole traders, employees of state governments, local government employees, workers in community organisations and workers in workplaces such as amateur sporting clubs. Examples of stop-sexual-harassment orders could include an order that individuals treat each other with respect or do not make contact with each other, or orders for companies to provide all staff with anti-sexual-harassment training or to arrange a health and safety inspector to attend meetings and parties. This is a key measure of how we can make workplaces safer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we will add the new prohibition on sexual harassment and a complaints process which will allow all workers, including those sexually harassed in the past, to apply to the Fair Work Commission for a remedy. Workers will have access to conciliation and arbitration by consent. Thirdly, our new provisions are broader in scope than the previous government's laws applying to conduct that occurs in connection with work and are consistent with protections in the Sex Discrimination Act. This means that protections will clearly apply to workplace sexual harassment that occurs outside of working hours or in employer provided accommodation, and to prospective workers as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes send a clear message that workplace sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Our changes will open a new pathway for people to get an outcome without having to go through the court system, which can be slow, costly and traumatic. That's a huge barrier for many workers, particularly those in lower-paid or insecure jobs. Our changes mean that every worker—whether they're a nurse in Tamworth, a plumber in Perth, or an office worker in Canberra—can ask the Fair Work Commission to deal quickly and effectively with their complaint of sexual harassment, whether the harassment occurred in the past, is ongoing or both. The new provisions also allow for the national workplace relations regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to investigate and assist with compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these reforms fully implement recommendation 28 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, complementing the Attorney-General's reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act, which passed the parliament. The bill also strengthens the Fair Work Act's antidiscrimination protections to include gender identity, intersex status and breastfeeding, bringing it in line with other Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is serious about ensuring Australian workplaces are free from sexual harassment in all forms of discrimination, and if we successfully pass this bill I think it will send an important message to the Australian people as well.</span>

Can the minister confirm which industries the government intends will be eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream? I note, from the revised explanatory memorandum at page 168, reference is made to aged care, disability care and early childhood education. Is this an exhaustive list—in particular I am being asked by industries, 'Would we be an industry eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream?'—and are there any other industries that may fall under this stream?</span>

We've included a ministerial declaration for supported bargaining. This arose out of consultations that have occurred in relation to the bill. The purpose of the new power to make a declaration is to provide a final safeguard to ensure the supported bargaining stream is used in order to get wages in low-paid sectors moving. It is intended to provide some security so that we do not see a repeat of what occurred under the existing low-paid stream, where there were only four applications and no agreement ever made in reliance on low-paid authorisation.</span>

I thought my question was quite obvious. I just want to confirm this with you. We have the explanatory memorandum. It makes reference to certain industries that we've referred to. We've then established—and we're going to pursue it shortly—that the minister is able to make a declaration for another industry to be eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream. All I'm asking is: is that the only avenue under which you can be declared eligible to participate—that is, via a ministerial declaration—or is there another avenue? We've talked about aged care, disability care and early childhood education and care. Is there another avenue through which you actually can participate in the supported bargaining stream?</span>

So there are two ways. There is a ministerial declaration here—as I said, we're going to go through the ministerial declaration shortly—or, alternatively, I'm assuming you would make an application to the commission, 'Are we able to participate in supported bargaining?' and the commission would then determine whether you are an industry that is eligible to participate, based on the factors it needs to consider?</span>

What is meant by 'whether the likely number of bargaining reps would be consistent with a manageable collective bargaining process'?

I just want to confirm that, because this has been raised by a number of people. We are saying that we have an employer eligible for both the supported bargaining stream and the single-interest stream. We acknowledge they can be compelled into either. You are saying though that you absolutely cannot be compelled to bargain in the supported bargaining steam and in the single interest stream at the same time. As I said, this has been asked by so many employers and it would give them comfort to know that that is the case. I want to know, are we formally ruling it out?</span>

'May' being the operative word.

So we're not sure if there is a common interest. We do know that they are potentially not substantially funded, directly or indirectly, by the government. Is the guidance then that you should err on the side of not granting the authorisation? And is it the intent of government that the supported bargaining stream focus on funded sectors?</span>

That's understood there. Is it the intent of the government that the supported bargaining stream focus on funded sectors? The answer is that's not the primary focus. I understand that.

Given the answers to all the questions and in particular that there are changes that are happening to this particular stream, we can't give any further guidance other than what's already in the act in terms of the common interests. Ultimately, decisions are being left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. There is a focus on funded sectors, and we agree that's consistent with references in the revised explanatory memorandum and the government's own public statements about this stream being targeted at care sectors. We have established, though, that it's a focus and it's not exclusive. So, can you confirm that the supported bargaining stream is not directed at industries such as hospitality and retail?</span>

We have also, as we did last night, confirmed that we can't give any further guidance in relation to the common interest, and what is involved in the common interest. It's either there already in the Fair Work Act or it is being left to a decision of the Fair Work Commission. Unfortunately it's the words 'not exclusive' that are going to pose a huge problem.

That was the failure of the previous government—that you had that part of the legislation in place but no-one was able to use it successfully. So, the focus, from our point of view, is removing that red tape to allow it to be used. And it's got a particular focus, from our point of view, on those feminised industries that a lot of us have talked about substantially last night and today and is a real focus of the bill. And we think that is required and will hopefully drive an improvement in wages.</span>

And then I have a question as to whether the minister can confirm that the supported bargaining stream is not directed at industries such as hospitality and retail. You can't give that guidance because what we are actually saying is that it may well be, if certain factors are met, that the Fair Work Commission could make a determination that the hospitality and retail industries are actually eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream.</span>

We've just gone through a number of questions in relation to how you could potentially be deemed eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream. One of the amendments that was moved last night was government amendment (40). The amendment gives the minister power, by legislative amendment, to declare an industry, occupation or sector eligible for the supported bargaining stream 'if the Minister is satisfied that doing so is consistent with the objects of this Division set out in section 241'. Could I just get you to confirm: what are the objects in section 241 of the act?</span>

                    </a>  We were talking about the ABCC. I'm just looking at the time in terms of actually moving through them, because I do also have a number of questions in relation to the regulatory impact statement and the costs in that that I would like to ask you. I will go very briefly to the agreement approval, before I go to the costs in the regulatory impact statement. On page 125 of the revised explanatory memorandum, it states that changes in the bill to enterprise agreement approval requirements are intended to simplify requirements that need to be met for an enterprise agreement to be approved by the Fair Work Commission, which are often regarded as overly prescriptive and complex. One such source of complexity relates to section 181 and the way it's traditionally been interpreted by the Fair Work Commission in relation to which casuals can vote for an agreement. I understand that the government has indicated to employer groups that the changes contained in the bill will mean that the Fair Work Commission will take a less prescriptive approach. Employer groups are asking if that is the indication, that there will be a less prescriptive approach.</span>

They've had the opportunity—it's not BHP. Certain employers in the mining and resources industry have had the opportunity to consider the evidence and the answers that were given to the questions that I asked last night. I have some questions in relation to government amendment (44), which was moved last night. They're in relation to more detail and definition. We didn't get to fully explore this last night, given we hit a hard marker.</span>

We didn't actually get on to looking at what 'reasonably comparable' means. The government last night, at 6.26 pm, I think, tabled its amendments to the bill. The question is currently before the chair. Government amendment (44), which was moved last night, introduces the comparability test. For example, where two separate businesses in the mining industry operate different rostering schedules to create their own efficiencies which are fundamental to their operating models, is this enough for them to be considered not reasonably comparable?</span>

The question I put to you was: where two separate businesses in the mining industry operate different rostering schedules to create their own efficiencies which are fundamental to their operating models—you can see where this is going, because this is very, very serious in terms of 'reasonably comparable'—is this enough for them to be not considered reasonably comparable? The answer you gave was that this amendment had been made as a result of representations from the mining and resources industry, but then you also said it is actually a matter for the Fair Work Commission. Given that this amendment has been put in as a result of the conversations you had with the mining and resources industry, they are the ones saying they are more confused than ever now as a result of this and they desperately need the guidance. In relation to the conversations and the representations, again, I ask you: what further guidance can we give in terms of 'reasonably comparable' or 'not reasonably comparable'? I was part of the talks. The minister's office and the department were part of the talks. We've got an amendment that's been inserted, but there's nothing around the amendment. Or could you take me to the explanatory memorandum and take me through the guidance in relation to 'reasonably comparable'? </span>

The first is, of course, that the commission's required to consider all of the matters that it's required to consider, including a public interest requirement. The amendment would add a new subparagraph to paragraph 249(1)(b), which contains the factors of which the Fair Work Commission has to satisfy itself before making a single interest employer authorisation in relation to a proposed agreement. So the new subparagraph would require the commission to be satisfied that, in respect of each employer, it is a common interest employer and the operations and business activities of that employer are reasonably comparable with those of other employers that would be covered by the proposed agreement that relates to the single interest employer authorisation. So, employers of different size and scale might, depending on all the circumstances, be found to have clearly identifiable common interests for the purpose of bargaining together. The amendment would ensure that the Fair Work Commission must be also satisfied the operations and business activities of an employer are reasonably comparable with the other employers. It may be open to the commission to conclude that, despite two employers of a similar size, scope and scale operating in the same industry, they are not reasonably comparable. That is open to the commission, once the full extent of their business activities and operations are considered. </span>

Where specialist contractors are employed under a maintenance contract, these contractors have the same trades as employees in the host company but are specialised to fulfil specific roles—that is, for example, not labour hire. Could those specialist contractors be deemed reasonably comparable to employees in the host company under the legislation? The issue I have with the answer you gave—I agree; it's all set out in the act, but what I'm asking for is where is the additional guidance in relation to 'reasonably comparable'? Another example is two mining companies that compete at this level; they're all paying way above but we understand there is no carve out; the rostering system is different, but it's agreed and it suits those sites. Is that enough to actually have them as reasonably comparable, or does the difference mean they're not reasonably comparable? Ultimately, the words are there, but there doesn't appear to be any guidance given in relation to the words.</span>

On this side, we place great confidence in the independence and the capacity of the Fair Work Commission. Over the last few decades, I think the historical record demonstrates that we treat that independence seriously. You'll find that, when Labor was in government the last two times, we took industry and the industrial relations community seriously. We took expertise and independence seriously. You'll find that people with great capacity from the trade union movement, from employer associations, from the community sector and from the legal fraternity were appointed by previous Labor governments, with an ethos of independence and a commitment to the public interest. That wasn't demonstrated by the last government. I think 11 out of 44 appointments were not friends of the previous government and from employer associations. The last government treated the Fair Work Commission the same way it treated the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That has undermined industry's confidence in the independence of that institution. But on this side we put some faith in the capacity of the commission and its full bench to work through these issues in a sensible, pragmatic kind of way.</span>

I think you actually do political diatribe better than Senator Watt. I really do. I prefer your approach to it. But it doesn't assist statutory interpretation. It'll just be no, no, no, no. So now we go back to the actual answer to the question. To assist those going forward in terms of statutory interpretation, I just need to take you through this. This is a substantial amendment. You've had to bring forward this amendment because of representations made to you by particular industries. The issue I'm having is: the chamber doesn't have the benefit of a definition in relation to what 'reasonably comparable' actually means. With all due respect, I'm not asking you about appointments to the Fair Work Commission. I'm not going to question whether or not someone has expertise. I'm asking you: what is the guidance the government is giving to the Fair Work Commission in relation to 'the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable'?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade and Assistant Minister for Manufacturing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I appreciate the spirit in which the questions are asked. Occasionally you'll find that, when questions go to some of the aspects of the previous government's record in relation to the independence of the Fair Work Commission, I find it hard to resist pointing out the track record of politicisation of that institution. However, to your question: the amendment would also insert a new subsection—I think it's 249(1AA)—that would provide that, if an application for a single-interest employer authorisation is made by a bargaining representative under paragraph 248(1)(b), in respect of an employer that has 50 or more employees, it is presumed that the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that are covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is established. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the matters that are specified in subparagraph 249(1)(b)(vi) concern whether relevant employers are reasonably comparable in terms of their operations and business activities. Such evidence is likely to concern the nature and size of the employers and their operations and their business activities. While some of this information may be available, at least in part, to employees, particularly in smaller enterprises, much of it will only be known to the employer, or to employees only as it pertains to their role; that is, it may only be apparent to them in a partial or fragmentary way. This is particularly acute in terms of the nature of the employer's enterprise, the employer's business activities and operations. In most cases such information will be most readily available to employers or their bargaining representatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are considerations which must be balanced. Who should bear the burden of establishing that the relevant test is met or not met? Having regard to the burden that could be posed in enterprises of 20 to 49 employees, it is appropriate in such cases to require employees and their bargaining representatives to establish that the relevant test is made when making the application for the authorisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to employers with 50 or more employees, due to their increased size and complexity of their operations, they are more likely to be in a position to provide the relevant evidence going to these matters. In such circumstances it would also be much more difficult for employees and their representatives to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the test is met. It is appropriate, therefore, in the government's view, that the amendments provide for a rebuttable presumption and an opportunity for employers—that is, employers with 50 or more employees—to establish that the relevant test is not met in relation to their business. And for the kids upstairs listening to this, there will be a test at the end of the session! </span>

I refer to the release of ministerial diaries by the Attorney-General and the Treasurer detailing their first 100 days in office. The Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, has said, 'I'm going to continue to work with colleagues and across the Public Service on making sure that there is as much transparency as possible about our government information and ministerial diaries.' Minister, given the commitment of the Attorney-General to create 'as much transparency as possible about ministerial diaries', why is the Prime Minister refusing to release his diary, putting him at odds with his own Attorney-General and Treasurer?</span>

Obviously, every freedom-of-information request is distinct and has to be considered on its merits, and every minister will have to respond to requests in a manner that is appropriate to those individual circumstances. I'm not the FOI decision-maker, but I know that FOI decision-makers obviously will have to make a judgement on the basis of the merits of the application before them.</span>

So the Australian people, I think, will look at you and your questions, as a former member of the leadership group who helped cover up all of this, and they will look with a very clear eye at the hypocrisy on the other side of the table.</span>

We're working to get wages moving and putting downward pressure on costs, and from our first day in office our support ensured an increase to the minimum wage and a pay rise for aged-care workers. Albanese Labor are investing in cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, paid parental leave and secure jobs with better pay.</span>

We've expanded the Commonwealth seniors health card. We've ended the cashless debit card. We've established a royal commission into robodebt.

These are all things they could have done, but in nine years they didn't do them. We have already secured an increase in the minimum wage and an important pay rise for aged-care workers, and our secure jobs, better pay policy will boost wages even further. We on this side understand the impact that higher energy prices are having on households and businesses. But you know, we're actually trying to work on how we support households through that, how we have a response. Do you know what your response was? 'Let's hide it!'—let's hide it before the next election, let's make sure no Australian knows about the hike in fees, hide it until after the election. What a disgrace.</span>

We saw over the last nine years the slashing of Australia's development assistance. We saw Mr Dutton returning to the rhetoric around development assistance in the House this sitting period, and really that was a disgrace, because it reduced our influence and it left a vacuum for others to fill, and we have a lot of catching up to do.</span>

We are rebuilding relationships to ensure that Australia is the partner of choice in the region for our security and for the security of our region.</span>

I refer you to the answers you gave yesterday regarding secret government modelling in a document titled 'Estimated impacts of CFPS and associated coalmine closures', dated October 2020, which details almost 800 job losses in the Hunter Valley alone associated with government policies and the closure of mines. In April this year the now Prime Minister, when visiting the Hunter Valley mining communities, was quoted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newcastle Herald</span> under the heading 'Anthony Albanese "guarantees" no jobs will be lost on road to net zero'. Can the minister advise on whether the Prime Minister stands by his guarantees? </span>

I'm advised that the closures he talked about were in fact announced under your government. So I do find it somewhat passing strange that you try to make political mileage, as you are doing and as you did yesterday, about a closure that was actually flagged under you. That's probably a fact I should have been aware of, and I'm grateful to my colleagues and to the departments for letting me know that. But these are closures that were flagged under the former coalition government.</span>

One of the differences between those on that side of the chamber and those on this side is that we want to look after workers. We're a movement and a party that has workers at our core.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, I know it's hard for those who spend so much of their time arguing against pay increases and telling us the sky is going to fall if there's a $1 pay increase and saying we can't afford to give aged-care workers or those on the minimum wage an increase.

Does the Prime Minister stand by the Labor Party's pre-election modelling? Or does he accept the official government modelling that says Labor's policies in the Hunter will cause 800 job losses? </span>

This is a policy and a political point. You are also signed up to net zero by 2050, remember? I know you want to talk about that a lot in Kooyong and North Sydney—it didn't help.</span>

                  </a>  Well, this goes to policy. Meanwhile, Senator Canavan gets up and gives that rant, which shows that it was all fake. You thought you could say one thing in one place and one thing in another. Well, we are really clear: there is a transition that is occurring, a change in the global economy. We either get ahead of it and we help workers and communities thrive in that, or you keep going to them and lying to them, misleading them, about what is happening, because you're signed up to the same policy. You just don't have anything to back it. </span>

In 1991, Vanuatu, on behalf of small island states, first asked the question: 'Who should pay for climate catastrophe?' Over the next three decades, wealthy nations of the global north dodged and deflected that question, while continuing to fuel the climate crisis. They relentlessly pursued profit and power, putting the world on track for climate catastrophe and fuelling climate disasters. These disasters have affected 33 million people in Pakistan, and 50 million people in the Horn of Africa face the threat of famine, amongst many others.</span>

The government claims to be listening to the Pacific islands. The Pacific islands have waited decades for loss and damage funding that is owed to those nations as a matter of global justice. What will your government do to ensure that a fund is established urgently, with no room for backsliding?</span>

                  </a>  We had a long discussion yesterday about motivations. Senator McKim demanded something be withdrawn. I notice you did put it on social media afterwards anyway, but that's okay. But I would say to Senator Faruqi: the implication that we're not genuine in our engagement with our Pacific neighbours is wrong. We are. That does not mean there is not a lot that we have to work through, and I have been upfront with them. I have said: 'We are a highly emissions-intensive economy. We are seeking to shift the trajectory—the direction in which we're heading—and we are doing so belatedly. It will cost us more and it will be harder because of nine years of inaction. But we are serious about doing it.' So, please, if there was an implication, and perhaps I misheard, that somehow we are not genuine in how we engage with the Pacific—because we understand the nature of the threat—it is incorrect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I understand this is the political campaign that the Greens party wishes to run between now and the next election, if I may say; that's a decision for you. But actually the policy challenges are far greater—far greater. So you can have a mantra around that, but what we need to do is transition an economy which is not only emissions intensive domestically but reliant on highly emissions-intensive industries for much of our export revenue. Now, we have to transition the economy, change the economy, so our people, our children and our country can thrive in a net zero world. That is an enormous undertaking.</span>

Yes, the Albanese Labor government is supporting the tourism and travel sector's recovery in a way that the former Liberal-National government never, ever did. We know the vast majority of tourism businesses are small and medium sized. They collectively make a significant contribution to employment and our economy. To support this sector, we are delivering on our commitments, including through our $48 million investment over four years, and we're directly engaging with industry to address the challenges that they face. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August we held a tourism jobs summit to hear from industry about the challenges they face. We've launched a visitor-economy disability pilot. We're working on a project to better connect workers and employers in the industry. In October I hosted a Tourism Ministers' Meeting in South Australia, with state and territory counterparts, to collaborate on support for the industry, and I look forward to the next meeting, which will include the tourism minister from the re-elected Andrews Labor government. In October we launched the Come and Say G'day campaign to get international tourists back to Australia. Already, Senator Sterle, it's attracted 122 million views, which translated to a 74 per cent increase in traffic on Australia.com. </span>

In August we held a tourism jobs and skills summit to hear directly from industry about labour and skills challenges. You never held one. In September, we announced $3.3 million to establish a visitor economy disability pilot to help people living with disability secure sustainable jobs in the tourism industry. The pilot will address barriers identified by small and medium tourism businesses in recruiting, retraining and progressing staff with disabilities. We are working with the industry on a project to provide a one-stop shop showcasing career pathways, connecting employers with prospective workers and providing workers with information on jobs and upskilling opportunities. We want to see tourism workers return to the sector, after they were forced to find work elsewhere under the previous Liberal National government. </span>

The answer to the question is yes. The Labor Party has through our platform clearly outlined our position on education. We are the party that introduced needs based funding in recognition of students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, whether that be where they lived, whether they had learning disabilities, whether they came from non-English speaking backgrounds or whether they be First Nations children. We recognise that the resourcing of those schools needs to accommodate student populations. We have a long and proud history of that. I know that Minister Clare is working very hard in the next round of negotiations with states and territories about how to best meet not only the commitments we've outlined in our platform but the position that the government has taken around ensuring that the education system, mindful of the fact the states and territories have a significant role here and the independent and Catholic sectors also educate large numbers of children and young people, recognises disadvantage and that we try to structure our funding accordingly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know from my previous role that education funding and how the resourcing is applied is a very contested issue. It's not easy, it's not straightforward, but we remain deeply committed to ensuring that every child, regardless of where they live, where they come from, what their parents' incomes are, get access to the best education possible in this country. </span>

I understand the minister told you that this is a scheme created under the former government. However, when it was brought to his attention about the impacts and how they flowed through to schools, he asked the Department of Education to work towards resolving the issue. This work is happening and he is working with some urgency. </span>

The recent release of Australian Bureau of Statistics provisional mortality data for our nation shows all-cause mortality to the end of August is currently a staggering 18,671, or 17 per cent higher than the historical average. A report that appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span> medical journal also shows that Europe is facing an increase in cancer diagnoses, after an estimated one million cases went unfound due to the COVID lockdowns and other draconian measures. Can the minister advise what we are doing here in Australia to make up for the many thousands of likely missed cancer diagnoses over the last two years? </span>

                  </a>  That's fine. I'm not questioning it. I'm saying I haven't seen it. My answer is in relation directly to the question not the preamble. The question was: what are we doing? There is no doubt that our health services over the last two years were significantly affected by the pandemic. Services that would normally be provided through hospitals, through people going to GPs and through people seeking health treatment because they had a concern, significantly changed during the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working with the states and territories, as you would expect, through the National Health Reform Agreement, regarding transitioning out of the pandemic and the COVID focus. There'll be significant pressure on the hospitals, but also in primary care, as people come forward. There is no doubt there was delayed seeking of health attention or seeking of health assistance and access to services through the pandemic. It will take some time to work through that, but we are working with the states and territories—through the Prime Minister and the first ministers through National Cabinet—about pressures in the health system and transitioning away from COVID-19 and the COVID-19 focus.</span>

What is the minister doing to investigate the underlying cause of the spike in heart related issues? Does the government still assert that the mRNA injections are safe and effective? </span>

Myocarditis or pericarditis in younger people was one of the identified risks of those vaccines. Everybody was informed of that and it was seen as a risk. Where it affected people—particularly younger men, as I understand it—those adverse events were recorded. I should also say, the vaccines have saved thousands and thousands of lives, particularly the most vulnerable Australians, and the vaccine program was always about responding to that— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As Minister for Women I'm very proud to say that gender equality has been at the core of this government from day one, because gender equality is a core Labor value. I don't need to convince my colleagues, men or women, that we need to get moving on gender equality. We just get on with it. The Albanese government is putting gender equality front and centre of our economic policy. We're giving women more choices through modernising and expanding PPL and making child care cheaper. We released the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>under the leadership—</span>

We're implementing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect</span><span style="font-style:italic;">@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Work</span> recommendations, including a positive duty for workplaces to prevent sexual harassment.

Our government is building a stronger Public Service to better serve all Australians. We abolished the Liberal and National Party's arbitrary and damaging staffing cap that diminished the capability and capacity of the Public Service and led to an excessive and reflective reliance on wasteful external labour. We are reinvesting in the NDIA, in Services Australia and in the Department of Veterans' Affairs to improve service delivery for Australians. We've appointed a dedicated secretary for public sector reform to deliver on our agenda and have commenced an audit of employment to improve job security and save taxpayers' money. We have also restored the ability of workers and their representatives to bargain in good faith and be consulted. What about that? How radical is that! I want to take this opportunity to thank the 160,000 public servants who have worked so hard to support the government to deliver on our commitments to the Australian people.</span>

Prior to the election, Prime Minister Albanese said to all Australians, 'I'll say this very clearly, they will be better off under a Labor government.' He promised that a Labor government will see electricity prices fall from the current levels by $275 for households by 2025. But isn't it true that, according to your own budget, this December Aussies will have to pay 50 per cent more just to run the aircon, pump the pool and turn on the Christmas lights?</span>

We've got your people in the House voting against the censure motion for the former Prime Minister who made an artform of never taking responsibility for everything! So let's be clear about who has been prepared to be upfront with the Australian people, who are clear that we have a significant problem in our energy markets that the government is working through, which is as a consequence of nearly a decade of inaction and denial of 22 failed energy policies and what is occurring globally. I know those opposite don't want to be reminded of this, but the reality is renewables are the cheapest form of power.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first one went to transparency, and then we had some questions about the cost of living, and I seek to cover off on all of those in taking note this afternoon. The first question was on transparency. What we've seen with this government is a pattern of a lack of transparency, yet we heard time and time again throughout the election campaign and in the lead-up to it that the hallmark of this government would be transparency, it would be open to scrutiny and it would have integrity. But we're seeing anything but that so far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need to take a look at the inquiry that went into this fair work bill that the government is currently debating. There's a lack of transparency—a lack of scrutiny. They only allowed 22 days for stakeholders to present their concerns and their issues about the bill that is before this parliament—22 days to consider such a significant change to the Fair Work Act. This is absolutely outrageous. The government are not prepared to open themselves up to scrutiny—because if you did then you would find there were all sorts of holes, and that's what we're finding in the committee stage of that bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we have a situation where we have requested that details of diaries be revealed, be tabled, so that members of parliament can scrutinise whereabouts and with who various ministers are engaging. The Prime Minister has not provided his diary, so that the Australian people can have a look and so that this parliament can have a look at what is going on. This is very disappointing, and it's a very concerning precedent that's being set here. Even the leader of the government in this place is not making her diary available. I look forward to it being available. I've got no doubt that Senator Wong is engaging in some very important issues in her portfolio. Why not open it up? Why not fulfil the obligation that they have to be transparent and honest with the Australian people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We asked some questions about the cost of living, and we had some—would you call them answers, colleagues? I'm not sure that they were really answers, because they were just ducking and weaving around the reality. We heard time and time again—over 90 times throughout the election campaign alone—that this government was going to tackle energy prices. They were going to in fact reduce the cost of energy by $275 for the Australian people. It was promised to the Australian people that that would happen, but it hasn't. What we're seeing is that Australians are going to be worse off under this government—in fact, $2,000 worse off by the time we get to Christmas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, I asked what the impact was going to be. Australians are buying their ham, their turkey and their bonbons and getting themselves ready for hosting a Christmas lunch with their family, which I'm sure they've been looking forward to for so long, because we know that last Christmas many families were apart and weren't able to get together. They're looking forward to getting together this Christmas. But what they're seeing when they go to the grocery store is that the cost of delivering Christmas this year has gone up, the cost of buying presents for the kids has gone up, because this government is not doing anything to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that is before us right now. Inflation is going up. Interest rates are going up. The cost of delivering Christmas is going up. I look forward to the responses of those opposite, who might be able to rebut what I'm saying—but there's not. There's nothing that they can say, there's nothing that they can point to that would demonstrate that they're actually doing something to address this cost-of-living crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to wish everyone a very merry Christmas. I hope that you do get to celebrate and have a great time with your family, and I hope you do get to enjoy a lovely Christmas lunch with them, because I know many Australians last year didn't get to enjoy that. I hope they get that chance, even though it's costing them more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  To paraphrase a great film from the early noughties, why are you so obsessed with us? All we have heard today from those in the government is their own views on what happened when we were in government. There weren't many constructive ideas at all coming from members of the government today. I think that's really disappointing. We are seven months into this government now, into this new parliament, and the broken promises are starting to stack up. The problems are out there. Australians are under the pump. We have a government that promised one thing in May, and, at best, they do something entirely different, and, at worst, they don't even address the problem to start with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, and while the now government was in opposition, Labor promised on multiple occasions that they would fix the rising cost of living. They said they had a plan. They promised that they would reduce inflation. They promised that they would help Australians get household budgets under control. They promised that the average Australian could expect to see a $275 reduction in their power bills. And they promised that they would be a transparent and accountable government. It all sounded so easy, and they promised an easy fix. But it turns out that governing the country isn't as easy as some of those opposite expected. Maybe that's why they come into this place and, instead of talking about what they should be doing, they just talk about their perceived issues with the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, under Anthony Albanese and Labor, we have an economy with high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and skyrocketing costs of living. But their dismal economic management and failure to deliver what they promised doesn't stop there. Like I said, Labor have also abandoned their promise to reduce household electricity prices for Australians, a promise which they said would save the average Australian $275 on their power bill.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Birmingham and Senator Scarr, for the interjections there. This late in a sitting week I didn't have the number quite front of mind. But the number I did have front of mind is 275, because that's how many dollars they said your electricity bill was going to go down by. Instead of making savings for households, the government has been forced to make an embarrassing admission that, over the next two years, Australians can expect to see electricity prices go up by 56 per cent. People voted for Mr Albanese and Labor based off this promise. The question is: what is Labor going to do about it? The fact is: they do not have a plan. That is why we saw this behaviour from the government today. They will talk as much as they like about the last nine years and their various views on our government, but, six months in, they can't focus on the issues that are important to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not even Labor state governments believe that the Albanese government has a plan that's going to work, let alone a plan that's going to deliver that $275 promise. I was looking through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> yesterday and I read that the South Australian government was appealing to the federal energy minister not to do anything stupid. Well, it's a bit late for that. Most people would say that promising every Australian household that their power bills would go down by hundreds of dollars, to win an election, and then announcing in your first budget that bills will actually be going up by hundreds of dollars is a fairly stupid thing to do. The Albanese government's plan to put a cap on gas prices faces a new roadblock, with the South Australian government joining industry warnings that it could deter investment in new gas supply developments. That was the report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin </span>yesterday. This came on the same day that the Queensland Labor government told the Albanese government to keep its hands off their generators. Not even Labor governments trust other Labor governments to bring down power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dishonesty that was on display by the Labor Party earlier this year when they promised Australians they would lower the cost of living is extraordinary. When they promised Australians they'd get a $275 cut to their power bills, millions of people believed them. They believed them when they said that they were going to be a government that was about transparency and accountability, and yet this week, in this place, they tried to take days out of our Senate estimates sitting schedule for next year. You can't be much less interested in transparency and accountability than that—taking away the ability of this chamber to scrutinise the decisions of government. Instead of a $275 cut, Labor brought out a budget promising Australian households a 56 per cent hike to their power bills, and now we are seeing Labor state governments fighting with the federal government about these very same issues. It's not good enough. Six months in, it's a pretty disappointing result for the government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  Well, the opposition's lack of transparency has followed them right into opposition and into this question time. They failed to nail the government at all when they raised these issues, because we have been very fair and transparent in our commitments to the Australian people. But if we look even at how the opposition asked their questions today, when Senator Cadell said to Senator Wong, 'I refer to your secret modelling that demonstrates that there will be coalmining closures as a result of your policies', then lo and behold, what do we find? Those very coalmines were forecast to close and their closure announced under the last government. So, far from being attributable to the Labor Party's policy commitments and indeed the commitments we have made to the Australian people, those job losses were forecast under the opposition's policy settings from when they were in government—the opposition's complete lack, frankly, of policy settings, as we've heard many times in this place. We saw under the last government some 22 energy policies in the time they were in government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about our commitment to preventing job losses on the road to net zero we're serious about it. That's why we do this modelling—so we can see the impact of our policies on local employment markets and so we can work out where to stimulate in order to mitigate any changes in those local job markets in order to prevent those job losses. We've also had from those opposite today a debate about cost of living. Well, one of the key contributors to cost of living in this nation has of course been electricity prices, gas prices, things you didn't do anything about in your absolute lack of policy clarity on those questions—again, a mess that we in government are now left to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite like to lambaste us for our reduction target for emissions, and we've talked about the Hunter and other coalmining precincts. Well, we're proud to be a government that is currently working with the government of New South Wales, a Liberal government. They have a reduction target to get to a 50 per cent reduction by 2030. Are you blaming them for this landscape? Are you making accusations of them that attributes job losses to them? Well, no, because we know that these reduction policies are both good for our environment and good for the economy. They're not easy transitions to make. They have complex adjustments for economies and communities that we need to be smart and organised about. But the economic modelling and indeed the historical record, when you look at things like the short time that we had the carbon reduction scheme in place, or if you look at the success of existing renewable energy technologies that are widely used in Australia and their costings, demonstrate that our modelling and our commitments absolutely stack up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government that wants to look after workers, because we care about the cost of living. We are here today in this chamber spending most of the day debating industrial relations laws that will empower workers and workplaces to work with their employers to improve productivity and increase wages and conditions where they're deserved. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:29</span>):  It has only been four weeks since the Labor government's first budget, and that budget wasn't so much about their own figures, but it had a shocking impact on the budgets of average Australian families. In that budget it was revealed that energy prices for Australian families in the next two years are set to skyrocket by 56 per cent. There has been massive community outrage at this, especially given that only six months before the government had promised to actually cut people's power bills by $275.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, in the past four weeks, the government has flown more kites than you'd see on a windy beach. Every day there is a new kite being flown about what they're going to do about energy prices. This is despite them saying that they had planned six months ago to actually deal with them. I've only just been speaking to some major energy companies this morning, here in this place, and they're shaking their heads. They're shaking their heads at this government because they have no idea what they're going to do. Every day, basically, they wake up, they read the paper and they read about the latest battles that are going on with this divided government—this government with no direction—about how they're going to get people's energy bills down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to go through the absolute rabble that this government has been over the past month. On 28 October 2022 on the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Daily</span> website there was a story which said, 'Labor refuses to rule out gas export cap'. It said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Former competition watchdog boss Rod Sims has suggested the government threaten gas providers with export limits to try to lower Australian prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Energy Minister Chris Bowen didn't rule out such as drastic move when asked about it on Friday morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's on the table. They have no idea if there's going to be a gas export cap and we still don't know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then on 26 October, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported in a headline, 'Windfall levy and changes to GST ruled out':</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Jim Chalmers has ruled out changes to the GST or hitting gas exporters with a windfall profits tax …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only about two weeks later after the Treasurer, nonetheless, had ruled out a windfall profits tax, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> reported on its front page, on 11 November, under the headline 'Labor risks new row with miners over coal and gas tax', that Anthony Albanese had not ruled out a new tax on gas and coal to help ease energy prices for households and businesses, and had said that the government is 'working through the issue'. I wonder if Mr Albanese had spoken to his Treasurer, who had ruled out such a tax just two weeks before? What the hell is going on with this government? Why can't they keep things in order? We are talking about extremely serious matters which they are messing around with because they have no idea what they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks on, by 29 November, there was a story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> where they had come up with a new idea, 'Anthony Albanese's fix for electricity bills: direct subsidies for homes, businesses'. This was the third energy plan in just a few weeks. It was floated this week. Also, on the same day—on the very same day—the ABC reported that the government was to cap wholesale gas prices as part of a market intervention to lower power prices. So that was a record: they had two energy policies on the same day, which were briefed out to different newspapers. No-one has any idea what they're doing, let alone themselves. They have no idea what they're doing here. They made promises; in the words of Maverick, they tried to cash cheques that their body couldn't keep six months ago at the election. They said they could cut our power bills by $275, but when they got to government they had no idea how to do this. Instead, we're facing skyrocketing power bills ahead of Christmas this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, once we leave this place, this government have to get their act together because the Australian people rely on it. They need to get some consistency into their energy policies, not this rabble that's going on and playing out in our nation's newspapers. They need to talk to these energy producers, they need to talk to the industrial customers and, most of all, they need to talk to the Australian people—and none of these weasel words, this corporatese that they've been using and which was said again by their leader today. He said that they're going to transition workers to new jobs. That means you're going to lose your job. People know that. When they hear the word 'transition' that means, 'I'm going to lose my job.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And if that's what you mean then you should just say it. It's a lot more trustworthy when you say that, because when you use words like 'transition', you sound like a second-rate HR manager at a large business. You sound like the character from the Dilbert cartoon, Catbert. You're all a bunch of Catberts over there when you use words like 'transition' instead of speaking plainly to the Australian people. If I know anything about coal miners in this country, they don't take kindly to the rubbish and the BS that sometimes comes from this other mob. Just speak the truth to us and be honest.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that Senator Whish-Wilson will take part of my time. In 1991, Vanuatu, on behalf of small island states, first asked this question: who will pay for climate catastrophe? Over the next three decades, wealthy nations of the Global North dodged and deflected that question while they continued to fuel the climate crisis. They relentlessly pursued profit and power and put the world on track for climate catastrophe and disasters. These disasters have affected 33 million people in Pakistan; 50 million people in the Horn of Africa face the threat of famine; and the climate crisis is an extensional threat to the Pacific nations. After decades of pushing by the Global South, a loss and damage fund has finally been agreed to, and New Zealand, Denmark, Germany and Scotland have all committed to contributing, but Australia still refuses to commit its fair share to loss and damage funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the climate change minister tabled his first annual climate change statement and mentioned the devastating floods in Pakistan as well as the climate risks faced by Indonesia and the Pacific islands. But it's simply not enough for the government to acknowledge these climate catastrophes and grave climate risks faced by countries of the Global South. It needs to stop pouring fuel on the fire. It beggars belief the climate change minister did not once mention the words 'coal' or 'gas'—not a single time. Honestly, what does the government think is causing the crisis in the first place? Strong and urgent action means no new coal and gas. It is untenable to keep sacrificing the lives and livelihoods of those in poorer nations to maintain the profit margins of fossil fuel conglomerates, many of whom fill political donation buckets for both the big parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is a matter of global justice. Those who did nothing to create it are facing the first and worst consequences. Loss and damage funding is about compensation and a debt owed for the terrible legacy of extractivisim and colonialism by the Global North. It is not charity; it is about righting historic wrongs. Given Australia's dirty hands in producing carbon emissions, we have a special responsibility to do everything we can for climate justice. Australia needs to use its diplomatic weight to push for the loss and damage fund to be set up urgently and take the lead by unequivocally committing to loss and damage funding and pay its fair share. That's what real climate leadership on the global stage looks like. That's what listening to our Pacific neighbours looks like. That's what global justice demands of us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  Not only has the government not answered Senator Faruqi's question on climate change today; they have also not complied with an order of the Senate to provide critical details on their formal response to the IUCN and UNESCO reactive monitoring mission report, which they were happy to release earlier this week. They seem to be very big on rhetoric and very light on detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Plibersek has sat on this report for at least three months. She very craftily put the response out this week, nicely massaged, given to favourite media outlets—we know how it all works. No doubt she also spoke to stakeholders and gave them a sneak preview of it. We hear the response from the government. Of course the report wasn't what they wanted to hear. The IUCN and UNESCO committee recommended that the Great Barrier Reef should be put on the 'in danger' list because its outstanding universal values are going to be severely impacted by climate change. It recommended that the government meet its Paris protocols.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why doesn't the government comply with the order of the Senate and provide its official explanation to UNESCO? Did the government say they were going to meet their Paris targets? We know they have legislated a climate target in this place—with no detail or plan for how they will meet it, by the way—that well exceeds our Paris commitments. We know they don't have a plan for that. Where is that detail?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What else did they say to UNESCO? Did they say it's unfair that the Barrier Reef has been singled out amongst all the world's coral reefs that are suffering because of warming oceans caused by the burning of fossil fuels? What kind of excuse is that, to say the Barrier Reef shouldn't be singled out? We should be showing leadership and saying that's why the reef should be put on the endangered list, so we can all take action right around the world and understand the gravity of the situation we and future generations are facing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The DGTO is a 30% refundable tax offset for eligible companies that develop eligible games and spend a minimum of $500,000 on qualifying Australian development expenditure from 1 July 2022. The new offset is estimated to increase payments by a total of $38.4 million over four years from 2021-22. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This legislation maintains the status quo. Clarification in the legislation is necessary following a decision by El Salvador to recognise bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender from 7 September 2021. This introduced uncertainty about the status of bitcoin and similar digital currencies for Australian income tax purposes which the legislation addresses</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's superannuation system manages over $3.3 trillion in retirement savings on behalf of around 16 million people. Given the superannuation system's size and compulsory nature, every Australian should expect the highest level of accountability and transparency from their superannuation fund. This measure seeks to ensure that the transparency, regulatory oversight and rigorous standards for the reporting of superannuation fund financial information meet these expectations. </span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Honourable senators, I have a statement in relation to opposition amendments on sheets 1704 to 1711. The government amendments on sheet PV124 included amendments to the definition of 'small business' for certain purposes. Amendments (45), (50) and (56) changed the size of small businesses to 20 employees. As those amendments have been agreed to, the series of amendments circulated by Senator Cash that also seek to change the size of small businesses are contrary to standing order 118(2). That standing order provides:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No … amendment shall be proposed which is substantially the same as one already negatived by the committee, or which is inconsistent with one that has been agreed to by the committee, unless a recommittal of the bill has intervened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, it is not in order for those amendments to be moved.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much. In relation to the statement that you have just made, let me be very clear to this place: I disagree with it. The reason I disagree with it is this: we are moving amendments to protect small and medium businesses in Australia from being compelled to bargain against their will in circumstances that they have never asked for. Chair, with all due respect, if you are telling me there is not a difference between a small business that has 20 employees and a business that has 200, I'm going to call you out and say you are wrong. If you are telling me that there is no difference between a small business in Australia that has 20 employees and one that has 175, I'll tell you you are wrong. If you are telling me there is no difference between a small business in Australia that has 20 employees and one that has 150 employees, again, Chair, you are wrong. If you are telling me that there is no difference between a small business in Australia and a business that has 125 employees, I am telling you you are wrong. If you are telling me there is no difference between a small business in Australia and a business that has 100 employees, I am telling you you are wrong.</span>

                    </a>  On a point of order, Chair, I just seek your guidance in terms of Senator Cash's direct criticism of a ruling that you have just made—and, if I might add, a complete mischaracterisation of what you've just said. It is my understanding that is well out of order, and I ask you for a ruling on that, please.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The CHAIR:</span>  I was allowing Senator Cash to make a contribution, but I have made the ruling. The ruling was made on the advice of the Clerk, and my characterisation of Senator Cash's contribution is consistent with yours, in that it's a criticism of my ruling. My ruling stands. Senator Cash, the ruling is in relation to the application of the standing orders. It doesn't apply to the actual amendment to the definition itself, which is what your contribution entails. The standing order says that you cannot make further amendments when an amendment has already been agreed to, in that the will of the Committee of the Whole has already been declared or articulated by the committee, and therefore to criticise the ruling is to criticise the decision of the Committee of the Whole. I'm prepared to give you the call again, but, if you wish to continue down the line you're taking, I will not give you the call.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Chair. What I will say is this: this is, without a doubt, one of the greatest travesties that businesses in Australia will ever face. The difference, quite frankly, between a business with 20 employees and a business with 21 employees is material to this debate. Why? Because a business with 20 or fewer is now excluded from the single stream of multi-employer bargaining. They can, yes, be compelled into the supported stream and they will face costs set out in the government's regulatory impact statement of around $14½ thousand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you see, Chair, with this ruling, which I respectfully disagree with, a business with but one more employee will now face costs of in excess of $80,000 per business. Colleagues, I remind you that in the regulatory impact statement it was $75½ thousand until during the committee stage when, amazingly, we were able to pick up that—and I quote the Minister of the Small Business, such is her contempt for small business—'the $5,000 was merely a typo'. That $5,000 means that businesses in Australia, according to the ruling that has been made, with 21 or more employees will now still be roped into—are able to be compelled into—the changes to the single-interest multi-employer bargaining stream against their will. Potentially, they will be bargaining with their competitors. The costs are set out clearly in the regulatory impact statement: $75½ thousand plus the small typo of $5,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to every business in Australia: this bill is going to pass and it's going to pass very soon. But let me be very, very clear on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, on behalf of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Susan Ley, and on behalf of every member of the Liberal and National parties in this place and in the other: we will never stop defending you. We will stand by you every single step of the way. The fact is that this ruling says, quite frankly, there is no difference. I say shame on the ruling, quite frankly! Shame on Labor and your contempt for small business and business in Australia—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Thank you, Chair, and thank you to David Pocock for gracefully allowing me to go first. The Greens are supporting the government's amendments. There are many elements in this bill that take our labour law into the 21st century. They address the real work circumstances of Australians and they promise to end the fall in real wages which means that so many Australians right now are struggling to be other than working poor. They work in poverty, despite getting a wage. Their wages have not lifted for 10 years and it's time to fix our labour law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to improve justice for the millions of women who can't predict their hours tomorrow or next week and the millions of workers who have become insecure and who live insecurely, with consequences for their children and their families. It's time to fix our labour law and to make it address the real circumstances that affect millions of Australians, the flexibilities that they need to put together for a job and care of their kids or the care of a parent. We need to increase the wages of the low-paid, the people who are looking after our kids, people in our aged-care sector and in our disability care. We need to narrow the gender pay gap which, for 30 years—and certainly for the last 10—has not seen a narrowing. We need to support more fairly the one in two workers now in our labour market who are women. Some of the warriors in this place are fighting the industrial relations battles of last century. I've heard, today and last night, lines that we would've heard over successive struggles over industrial relations. It's time to move forward so that our labour law addresses the real issues affecting real Australians in their millions outside this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to specifically say something about the amendments which protect the better off overall test and put in place protections to prevent low-paid workers from going backwards. The government's original bill attempted to remove prospective employees from being considered under the better off overall test when agreements were approved. The Greens were concerned that this would have left some workers worse off. After negotiations with the government, we're pleased to see these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will further ensure that future employees will be covered by the agreement that's considered by the Fair Work Commission when they're assessing an agreement against that better off overall test. The amendments also clarify that when applying the better off overall test and considering potential work patterns of current or future employees, the Fair Work Commission will have to assess any work patterns that the employer, union or employee considers reasonably foreseeable, with the Fair Work Commission having regard to the kind of business the employer is running.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes a new reconsideration process which allows employers, employees or unions to have agreements reconsidered against the better off overall test. These amendments will mean that if the Fair Work Commission changes an agreement because workers are worse off those changes can be applied retrospectively, allowing workers to have their pay backdated to the time of the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are an important win for workers, especially low-paid workers in retail and hospitality. So many of them are young people, so many of them are without very much power in the labour market. The better off overall test and its essential, important features has been preserved. Hence, for this, and many other reasons, which we will get to talk about this afternoon—and we will get to them—the Greens will be supporting this set of amendments. And we have supported them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will allow the Fair Work Commission to deal with employers who unfairly deny workers a request for an extension to unpaid parental leave. This will support parents to take the time they need to care for their child. Prior to this bill being introduced only two of the 11 National Employment Standards—that's the right to request flexibility and the right to ask for an extension of unpaid parental leave—did not have an enforcement mechanism. What do you call a labour law without enforcement? It's a failed gesture. And it especially affects women. So it's telling that those two mechanisms with the most important impacts for women haven't had enforcement—and now must. We are going to correct that with this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to see that Labor have listened to the Greens and included an enforcement mechanism in this bill for the right to request flexibility. That is a really significant step forward for the millions of people who want to work a different day, or they want to change their start or finish time—simple things that make such a difference to them as they put together the care for someone else and a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need an enforcement mechanism for employers who unfairly deny requests for an extension to unpaid parental leave. This is a really important thing for those who really need it. Their child is sick. Their plans haven't worked out on parental leave. They can't get child care. This will allow them to get some backup when they seek an extension to their unpaid parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we need to increase paid leave. We are so far from the international standard of 52 weeks of paid leave and we need to move towards that as soon as we can. But this measure will back up those who need an increase in their unpaid leave now. It makes no sense to leave only one of the 11 National Employment Standards without an enforcement mechanism, so I'm delighted to move this amendment which will make a real difference to the lives of many Australians. </span>

The government will be supporting these amendments. There are only two entitlements in the National Employment Standards that are unenforceable—the right to request a flexible working arrangement and the right to request an extension of unpaid parental leave. These entitlements are predominantly used by women. I also thank Senator Pocock for pointing out that the bill was already providing dispute resolution for one of these entitlements, flexible work. We support this amendment and also provide dispute resolution for the right to request unpaid parental leave as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments on sheet 1780 ensure that there will be a statutory review no later than two years after the commencement of the legislation. The review will look at, among other things, whether the operation of the amendments made by this act is appropriate and effective and identify any unintended consequences of the amendment made by this act and whether amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 or any other legislation are necessary to improve the operation of the amendments made by this act or rectify any unintended consequences identified. The persons who conduct the review must give the minister a written report of the review within six months of the commencement of the review, and the minister must then table a copy of the report within 15 sitting days. The amendment on sheet 1781 effectively extends the grace period from six months to nine months by altering the minimum bargaining period. This was something that came up repeatedly in the committee process.</span>

This amendment then gives six months before the review needs to be completed and a further 15 sitting days before it needs to be tabled. Given where we'll be in the electoral cycle, this amendment will essentially mean that it will be at least 2.5 years—possibly three years or longer—before any review is actually completed and tabled in the parliament. The extreme changes being proposed by the government, which will pass this chamber shortly, need to be reviewed independently and much sooner, given the significant ramifications that this bill could have on Australian workplaces and the Australian economy. Most concerningly, this amendment doesn't even say that the review should be independent. There's nothing stopping the minister from getting his own department or one of his friends to conduct a review of the legislation and literally say glowing things which are not true. So we would argue, Senator Pocock, that it should be an independent review.</span>

In relation to sheet 1781, the coalition will not be supporting Senator Pocock's amendment, which requires that the minimum bargaining period increase from six months to nine months. The amendment does nothing to make what is an incredibly bad bill any better. Businesses will still be forced to bargain against their own will, potentially with their competitors. This amendment will undoubtedly only lead to the words of businesses across Australia ringing true: more strikes and less jobs.</span>

If employers disagree with the term of an expired enterprise agreement, the Greens are worried they could act in bad faith by simply refusing to negotiate and then roll the dice and hope the commission arbitrates in their favour. The government has gone a long way to removing employers' terminating agreements as a bargaining tactic to undermine existing conditions, something we fully support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment does two things. It widens the eligibility for the right to request flexibility, and it establishes a positive duty in favour of creating flexible workplace in Australia. It's 2022. Flexibility should be available to all employees, not just those with narrowly defined family responsibilities. It's only when seeking flexibility is something available to all that the stigma will be removed from asking for it, and we will see more men seeking flexibility and hopefully sharing domestic and care duties as a consequence. Wider eligibility for flexibility has been adopted in the UK, based on clear evidence about its value. Guess what? The sky has not fallen. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this amendment establishes a positive duty to create flexible workplaces. A modern workplace should create an environment that actively anticipates and responds to the needs of its workers and doesn't require individuals to have to push for it one by one individually, too often at risk of job security. So many employers already do this, talking to employees. This amendment will encourage others to create that positive flexible environment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original bill inserts breastfeeding, intersex status and gender identity as attributes that the Fair Work Act protects from discrimination. These amendments copy that approach and simply add COVID-19 vaccination as an attribute protected from discrimination. The protection is still subject to the limits imposed on the other discrimination grounds in the Fair Work Act. An employer, for example, will not be in breach of the antidiscrimination grounds where the employer can prove, as they should have to, that it is a genuine and reasonable requirement of the position. These amendments are reasonable. In their approach, they are not radical because they use and simply extend the existing mechanisms in the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've long known that COVID vaccines do not stop transmission. Before this became apparent, getting vaccinated 'to protect others' was the justification many businesses used to roll out vaccine mandates that squashed people's jobs, livelihoods and careers. As a condition of keeping their job, many employees were coerced—and still are being coerced—into receiving COVID vaccinations and boosters they do not want. These vaccine mandates cannot be justified, given the fact vaccines do not guarantee protection from transmission. The New South Wales Personal Injury Commission recently agreed with this view, with workers' compensation being awarded for psychological distress stemming from the mandates in the determination of Dawking v Secretary (Department of Education), handed down on 3 November.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes the wheels of justice turn slowly, yet we are happy that judicial bodies are taking up this self-evident position that broad vaccination mandates cannot be justified. Despite this, mandates are still in effect across the private sector. It's clear that further legislative action needs to be taken. Businesses are simply ignoring the evidence against unjustified vaccine mandates. A clear message needs to be sent that unreasonable directions that infringe on workers' rights have no place in Australian workplaces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Often, mandates do not even account for Australians who have accepted medical contra-indications to vaccination. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper reports that Qantas sacked a pilot for failing to comply with a vaccination mandate while he was off work, in a serious condition, being treated for bowel cancer. Separately, I have met with a Qantas employee, who after being injected with the first COVID injection, was rushed to hospital with severe, possibly life-threatening, disability due to the COVID injection. After hospital care and partial recovery, he returned to work, where Qantas insisted he get the second injection. He contested it and is now on vastly reduced pay on workers compensation. He fears his career with Qantas is finished That is discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to reinforce workers' rights to refuse a workplace direction where it is not a reasonable and justified requirement of the job. It leaves no doubt for employees and employers that vaccine mandates must not be in place unless there is a reasonable and justifiable need for them. Minister, given that businesses continue to ignore workers' rights in this area, will the government support this amendment to reinforce the decisions of the Fair Work Commission and codify protections for workers against unreasonable workplace directions?</span>

                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I'd like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Roberts and indicate to the chamber that I will be supporting his amendments because I support workers' rights. A fundamental right of every Australian should be to earn a livelihood to support their family. That should be a basic right. In fact, it's a right we have signed up to in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. One of the enshrined human rights that we as a country have signed up to is the right to work to provide for your family. With the introduction of vaccine mandates last year, we denied that right to thousands of Australians who were thrown out onto the streets and had no way to provide for their families, in the short term at least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mandates were never justifiable. Even I thought at the time that there was no evidence that the vaccine stopped transmission. Really, the only justification you could have to overturn and override that fundamental human right would be if somehow getting the vaccine protected a third party. I said at the time, and I'll say now that if we had a vaccine that could stop COVID in its tracks and prevent that death, I would consider some limitations on other rights. That's the way rights work. There is a right to life, as well. Sometimes we have to weigh these different human rights up. But if it wasn't apparent a year ago, it is clearly and starkly evident today that, for whatever the merits of the coronavirus vaccines, they do not stop transmission. Someone's else not having the vaccine is of no risk to you or anybody else in our society, and we know that now because we've largely got rid of mandates, in any case. They're gone, largely, but they are not completely removed. They still exist in the resources sector, where I come from in Central Queensland, where people have been locked out from their jobs because some companies have dug their heels in, if you like, and are maybe embarrassed to back down on the very strong stances they took a year ago that have proven to be wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity, when we're debating this type of legislation, to protect the rights of workers and to protect the rights of individual Australians to provide for their families. There can be no justification now to continue these mandates. Keep in mind, too, that even if you supported the mandates—I've never seen a mandate for a booster; I actually don't know. I think some health authorities might, but all of the mandates I've seen in private companies are for the original two shots. For anyone who took the original two shots on the timeline for most of us—that is, by late last year—they've already worn out. We know that from the science. The science says that, after 12 months—well, after six months really, but after 12 months definitely—there is no more impact of those first two shots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if you thought this was an issue or if these private companies thought there was a risk, why aren't they mandating the third shot—the booster—or a fourth shot? They're not doing that because they'd lose a lot of their workers if they did. These have no basis in science. All they are doing is hurting Australian families—admittedly fewer than last year. Thankfully, most of these mandates, as I say, have gone. The state governments have largely got rid of them in their laws, but there are still people being hurt by this. There are still people being harmed by it. They have no justification. I will once again stand up for the right of all Australian workers to make decisions about their health care when it doesn't affect the health of others.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I want to make some brief comments in support of this, and I thank Senator Roberts for bringing this important amendment to the chamber. To add to Senator Canavan's comments on the subject: I think this is a topic which has picked up some acceleration over the last period. We're not in December 2021 anymore. A lot of the stuff we actually did know at this time last year—or that many of us knew—is now plainly evident. And as Senator Canavan said, the science is now settled on this issue. Transmission of the COVID virus is not affected by the use of these therapies. They are experimental therapies, and, at the end of the day, people have to accept that. I know there's a degree of cynicism in this room and there has been a period of 12 to 18 months of name-calling—antivax and this, that and the other—but the reality is that people have been forced into a very difficult decision over the past 12 to 18 months in order to keep their livelihood or take a risk on this therapy, and that has been wrong.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in the last two years, in my view, is one of the greatest scandals in Australian history—certainly in Australian medical history. This parliament and this Senate need to take the opportunity now to support this amendment—I support this amendment—and allow people the opportunity to return to work without the fear of losing their job because of a medical choice. There is no risk to the public. We have got private companies that are still engaging in this, and we need to set the tone here now. We hear a lot about the party of the workers: the Australian Labor Party. Let me tell you: the trade union movement bailed out on Australian workers on this issue.</span>

I support it and I ask that others do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  Here we are at the end of 2022, and we've had over 10 million cases of COVID. The Australian health department, of course, stopped counting around September sometime because, I think, it was getting too embarrassing to admit that, despite over 20 million people having been vaccinated, over half the country had caught COVID. Whatever happened to protecting you? But we don't want to talk about that anymore. We'll just pull it off the website and we'll not discuss it. Then we've got the excess deaths that Senator Babet talked about before. We had 8,706 extra deaths last year, despite the fact that New South Wales locked down for three months. So, in theory, the deaths should have been lower, like they were in 2020, but let's not count 2021 in the ABS figures—sorry, it's 2020 they're not counting. Let's pretend nothing happened there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were almost 140,000 jab injuries—more than all the injuries reported from vaccines since 1971 and more than all the injuries put together. You've got an injury rate that's three times higher, yet the TGA don't want to look at the signal. The whole point of having a database where doctors report these injuries, where they tick the box 'suspected'—and, as the doctors say, they don't fill these forms out because they don't have the spare time. They don't have a lazy 20 or 30 minutes sitting around, filling these forms out, if someone fell off a bike. No, no—they're ticking these boxes because they believe that the vaccine caused the injury that they are reporting. Yet the TGA want to pretend that there's nothing to see here. And why wouldn't they? Professor Skerritt is head of an organisation that is funded by big pharma. If you want to talk about a conflict of interest, that's it. These guys have no idea what they are talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked Professor Brendan Murphy, who was the chief health officer at the time, whether or not he'd actually read the non-clinical report into the Pfizer vaccine. Guess what? He hadn't read it. Despite that, he had been saying for a couple of days prior to that that the spike protein wasn't in the blood. Had he read the report, he would have known that they never even tested the spike protein. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And they would have also known that, when they did the animal trials, that the report said there was no difference in lung inflammation between the placebo group and the vaccinated group after nine days. There was not one skerrick of evidence that showed that that vaccine was effective. But did anyone in this chamber right here, right now, actually read that report? I bet not, but you all went out there and said it was safe and effective, when you didn't have a clue what you were talking about. Shame on you. Because the law in this country, in the Australian Immunisation Register, says, No. 1, you cannot be coerced into taking a vaccine, and, No. 2, you need to be properly informed about what is in the vaccine. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got to dig very far to get to the bottom of this stuff, but that spike protein in the vaccine isn't even the same as the spike protein in the virus. No. They've actually changed one of the nucleotide and they've actually got a synthetic gene in the vaccine. They've added 17 nucleotides to the poly(A) tail, which is designed to make it last longer. It's designed to last longer. </span>

                    </a>  Listen to this, Senator Hanson-Young: despite the fact that the concentration of the lipids that are cationic would double in the ovaries from day one to day two, do you know what they did? They stopped the trial. They stopped the trial and they went and told everyone that it just stays at the site of injection. That was a blatant lie. If you want to talk about misinformation, go and check out page 44 of the Pfizer non-clinical trial report. It was released on the TGA FOI disclosure log 239-6. I've read it numerous times. Guess what, you should also read the top paragraph of page 8, that says, 'The study suggests that the spike protein can be either inserted into the membrane or secreted from the cell.' What does that tell you? I'll tell you what that tells you. It tells you that rather than killing the actual pathogen, which is what a normal vaccine would have done, this particular vaccine goes inside your cell, takes over the reproduction—the ribosomes, which are what produce the protein—and then starts producing more of the toxic substance. That is not the name of the game. You want to actually kill the virus; you do not want to reproduce it. And, of course, Brendan Murphy, the then chief health officer, claimed that there was nothing to worry about. He never read the document. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got Professor Kelly. He came out and made the bold statement that it stops transmission. He was lying, because the FDA came out in December 2020 and said that there was no evidence that the vaccine stopped transmission. When I pressed him on it, there are no trials to show that there's any IgA in the mucosal system. You don't have to take my word for it. Go and speak to Robert Clancy, Australia's foremost immunologist and vaccinologist. He's retired. You can trust this guy. He's not on the take from big pharma or the big universities that aren't actually interested in research; they're just interested in lining their own pockets. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we've got the vaccine injury scheme, which is just a joke. Today, and last night, and day after day for the last 15 months, I get contacted by people who have had their lives destroyed by this vaccine—a vaccine that the government said was safe and effective. And if isn't bad enough that these people—I'm looking at you people in this chamber here today—didn't read the documents, this took over someone else's body because it suited your narrative, your command-and-control narrative. You showed no humanity—no humanity. There are people out there who are not only injured; they have lost their jobs, and they cannot get medical support to help them. There are husbands and wives who had to quit their jobs to stay home and look after those people who are injured and are in an incredible amount of pain.</span>

The idea that businesses in this country can be responsible for the transmission of an airborne virus is just as absurd as the billions of dollars that are getting wasted on the idea that you can control some tiny trace gas in the atmosphere. We are living in the land of the unicorn farmers and intellectual pygmies who are just chasing the impossible dream. Like Sancho Panza chasing the windmills, it is absurd. Yet we stand here today, almost three years after the virus broke out in China or whatever, and we still have these ridiculous mandates in so many places, particularly in private industry, which is what this amendment will address.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to remove the provisions currently preventing the territories from passing legislation which would allow for voluntary assisted dying. The bill would not legalise that in either of the territories but rather would allow the legislative assemblies of the ACT and the NT to pass laws allowing for VAD. Despite what the Labor Northern Territory and federal House of Representatives members have portrayed of me publicly, I do support the bill and am doing my job—which they should note how to better do themselves—in making a bad bill better for the Territory. I'll say this again: I absolutely support the rights of Territorians. The proposed amendments, drafted by the parliamentary clerk, have been developed to ensure that the exact restraints that are currently operative in state law are applied in the Territory, because we have some of the most vulnerable communities and people in Australia.</span>

The Northern Territory Labor government are too busy protecting their own parliamentary convicted paedophiles to protect life. Alcohol related crime and violence are out of control. The federal Labor members for Lingiari and Solomon should hang their heads in shame. Both have publicly called for the CLP to disendorse me because I'm doing my job in the Senate by making a bad bill better. They are misleading Territorians about my actions on this bill. Not supporting a bill in its current form and proposing amendments that already exist right across Australia is doing my job to scrutinise a bill for the betterment of Territorians. There seems to be so much unease about me speaking the truth on what's going on in the Northern Territory. In relation to this bill, no states across Australia allow access to assisted dying for those under the age of 18. This proposed amendment ensures that this applies in the Northern Territory. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those with mental illness and those with disability can still access the schemes if they meet other criteria under state law. So, if it is so good for these other states, why is it not good enough for the territories? There are those that think this might be a radical reform. I can tell you now it's not a radical reform to ensure that children don't have access to voluntary assisted dying. This does occur in some Scandinavian countries, and in Canada a person with a mental health condition and disability can access their assisted suicide scheme even without a terminal condition. Why, you have to ask, does Senator Pocock oppose an amendment that provides additional safeguards for children, those with a disability and mental health conditions? Why is he seeking to erode protections for vulnerable persons in the territories? </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria, voluntary assisted dying is only for people who are suffering from an incurable, advanced and progressive disease, illness or medical condition who are experiencing intolerable suffering. The condition must be assessed by two medical practitioners to be expected to cause death within six months. There is an exception for a person suffering from a neurodegenerative condition, where instead the condition must be expected to cause death within 12 months. Voluntary assisted dying is only available to Victorians who are over the age of 18, who have lived in Victoria for at least 12 months and who have decision-making capacity. To be eligible for voluntary assisted dying they must be experiencing suffering that cannot be relieved in a manner the person considers tolerable. In Victoria, mental illness or disability alone—which is what I have provided for in this amendment—are not grounds for access to voluntary assisted dying, but people who meet all other criteria and who have a disability or mental illness can still access the service.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New South Wales was the last state to pass similar legislation. Some are not confident there are enough safeguards for people with mental health issues, so this is a lesson learnt—that the Australian government does have a responsibility to ensure vulnerable people are protected. The amendment is simply saying that you cannot solely—and I emphasise 'solely' because there are a number of measures that one must meet to be eligible—use the basis of having a disability, like autism, to access the provision of euthanasia or assisted dying.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I don't take my decisions lightly. I come from a part of this country where we have some of our most vulnerable Australians. There is often not enough education and consultation in this area, and I would ask that the Territory government—or whatever territory government decides to legislate for this—do the right thing and do the consultation to alleviate fears on the ground of vulnerable Aboriginal people that if they enter into a hospital and they are unwell they might be given a needle and killed. I can tell you now that there are vulnerable people who think this where I come from. There is a lot to consider with this bill, but my amendments are fairly straightforward, and I hope that I can get the support of my colleagues in this chamber—right through this chamber—for these amendments ensuring that our vulnerable people in the Northern Territory are protected. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Finance, Minister for Women, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment from Senator Nampijinpa Price, and I accept that you have not taken this decision lightly. I think it's been a very respectful debate in this place, and I'm sure that that will continue as we reach the final stages of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go to the amendment, I acknowledge in the chamber that we have in the gallery the Chief Minister of the ACT, Andrew Barr; Minister Tara Cheyne; and Marshall Perron, a former minister of the Northern Territory. Thank you for being here. You created history and in a sense set off the concertina of legislation that we are currently here trying to repeal this evening. I also acknowledge Andrew Denton and Dr Swan from Go Gentle who are here as well as some of the supporters of the reform and the repeal of this legislation and a friend of mine, Gina Pinkus, who has lobbied very strongly across the community for this legislation to be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go to the amendment. I think the senator who moved them identified the issue that we are trying to deal with here, which is that this parliament should not be the place where we are looking for safeguards or putting in place restrictions on the job that we are wanting the territory legislatures to have the power to do. So I am speaking against the amendment, because the bill that is before us is a repeal of a law which prevents those legislatures from determining this matter for themselves. That is the soul, single and only purpose of the legislation before us—to get rid of the constraint on those parliaments from being able to debate that themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know and I accept that people feel very strongly about this and think the Commonwealth should have some control. I disagree with that, but also the way that this amendment is drafted is extremely broad. That we are trying to place restrictions, for example, on people with a disability, then that is a very broad definition. I think if this amendment was to pass it would render anything that the territory legislatures did ineffective. In a sense it is an anti-repeal amendment. I have no doubt it comes from a good place, but I am trying to explain to you that the bill that's before us tonight is about getting rid of constraints on the territory legislatures and leaving it to them to determine. When you look at the state jurisdictions that have put in voluntary assisted dying legislation, they have safeguards in place. They go through a process of consultation, they have ethics processes, they have oversight and they have safeguards, and it is appropriate that those legislatures do that job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our job here tonight is to get rid of the constraint that exists in only two jurisdictions, the ACT and the Northern Territory, whose citizens are currently now not afforded the same rights as citizens of every other jurisdiction, and their parliaments are constrained. They are democratically elected parliaments, they are mature parliaments, they are held accountable by their communities and they face elections. It is more than reasonable that these parliaments be allowed to do this for themselves. So, on the grounds that the amendment effectively tries to anti-repeal a repeal bill, I won't be supporting it. But, even on the way the amendment is drafted, if it got up it would mean that those parliaments would in effect not be able to put in place a voluntary assisted dying regime, which is up to them whether they do that. Our job is to get out of the way and let them have the same legislative responsibilities and powers as the parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia.</span>

Senator Nampijinpa Price is showing a great deal of courage in moving these amendments and is doing so solely—solely—because she cares about the most vulnerable people in the Northern Territory. Every person listening to this debate should sincerely acknowledge and give respect to my colleague Senator Nampijinpa Price for her stand in relation to this issue. And I dearly hope that when this debate is done and all of us in this place have respectfully put forward our comments that the position adopted in good faith—and sometimes it's very difficult to balance all the competing considerations in this regard—we can move on from this debate. The fact that different views are being expressed in the course of this debate in this chamber makes our democracy strong, and we should then move on and there should be no recriminations. There should be no looking back at the positions people have adopted in good faith. They should simply be respected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a few quick points about the amendment. The first is that as a Queensland senator I did read, in relation to the experience in the Northern Territory, and was deeply moved by—and I spoke about this during the second reading debate—an article written by Chips Mackinolty in relation to the laws that had previously been adopted by the Northern Territory. The title of that article is 'Right legislation: wrong jurisdiction?' Senator Dodson has referred to that article in the course of this debate. The fact of the matter is that the ACT is very different from the Northern Territory—extremely different, in many, many respects. I don't presume to stand in this place and say to the parliamentarians in the Northern Territory what they should or shouldn't do. But I have a responsibility as a senator in this place to consider those facts, and I think it is on the record that there are particular issues in relation to the Northern Territory. I dearly hope that whatever direction the Northern Territory takes it reflects on those previous experiences, which did cause me deep concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the issue of disability, I previously raised the point that the United Nations Special Rapporteur in relation to the rights of the disabled has written to the Canadian government raising concerns about their legislation, about the availability of medically assisted dying for people with a disability. I've spoken about the experiences in Canada of people with a disability being approached in hospitals, even by an ethics manager, and being asked to reflect on the cost of their medical treatment. That causes me deep, deep concern, because I think Canada should be seen as an analogue for Australia—an advanced country with a system of human rights recognition. However, that is the reality. I heard the story of a veteran who was suffering from chronic depression ringing a helpline and being told that perhaps he could access medically assisted dying. I dearly hope we don't see those sorts of manifestations occurring in the Northern Territory, the ACT or any other jurisdiction in this country. But the reality is that there are issues with respect to how the law is being put into practice in Canada, and that's why I believe that these safeguards make sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Nampijinpa Price has said, they're adopted in other states. I don't think it's particularly unclear, to be frank. I can see a difference between a person who suffers from an egregious illness like cancer et cetera and someone who has a disability. I can recognise that difference on the face of it. I sincerely do not believe that this amendment, these safeguards, would render any Northern Territory legislation nugatory. I simply don't believe that's the case. So I'm happy to rise and support my good friend Senator Nampijinpa Price, and I ask everyone to reflect on Senator Gallagher's words that this amendment comes from a good place. Once this debate is finished, I dearly hope we can just move forward. Thank you.</span>

Before I continue, I'll say what I said during my speech in the second reading debate: I do respect the way that the Senate has undertaken this debate—that goes for everyone, including what we just had there from Senator Scarr and from Senator Gallagher before him. Everyone has really engaged very respectfully in this debate, and I think that's a real credit to everyone here. I'm very proud to be a senator in this place, with people who are prepared to have a debate like this and with the kind of respect that has been shown.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this amendment. In my second reading contribution I spoke about the concern that there are other jurisdictions around the world, like in Belgium, that allow for people with mental health issues to seek out euthanasia. The Netherlands has legislated to allow this for children—people under the age of 18. My concern is that we have been asked here with this bill to make a decision about what legislation will eventually be introduced into the Northern Territory and the ACT about assisted suicide. I feel that we're making a decision here when we actually don't know properly what the ramifications will be and what safeguards will be in place. These amendments go some of the way on this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this has really passed the second reading. This is about just putting up some rails so that we can be sure, as the Senate and as the parliament, that safeguards are in place to make sure that we don't allow laws that would enable children or indeed those who have mental health conditions to seek out these services. On that basis, I will vote for these amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I'd like to make a contribution to the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022. I appreciate that it is unlikely to stop this, but I'd like to put this on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are so far apart, and not just in terms of distance. It is simplistic to think that the Restoring Territory Rights Bill is about territory rights. This bill only seeks to repeal sections of the act which deal with a single issue: medically assisted dying. The NT population is small, at 233,000, and 44 per cent of its citizens are Aboriginal. Thirty per cent of its population is regarded as 'just visiting'. Average individual income is $267 less than that in the ACT. Compare those figures to the ACT population at just over 454,000, two per cent of whom are Aboriginal. And 20 per cent have more tertiary education than those in the NT.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory federal seat of Lingiari, which covers the NT except for Greater Darwin, has the highest proportion of Indigenous people of any electorate in the country, many of whom live in remote communities, and it has the lowest rate of voter enrolment in the nation. If the NT considers this, it is those people who will be poorly represented in the conversation. Illness and death visit Aboriginal people at uber alarming rates compared with other Australians. I've weighed up the fact that the need to protect the most vulnerable people is necessary. Those who will be impacted differently and disproportionately by this legislation, regardless of cultural, social or economic disadvantage, need greater protection. So I support this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation is one thing, but its implementation is quite another. I have considered, also, spending millions and millions on improving the high rate of early deaths of Aboriginal people—12 years less for men and 10 for women—only to offer those with multiple, complex chronic illnesses a legal way to bring about an early death. Remember, there is more death much earlier and with much more comorbidity caused by health issues like heart and kidney disease, diabetes, liver disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, cancer—these are major contributors in Aboriginal communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will be significant for the people of the Northern Territory, and they need to have this explained to them to avoid fear and misinformation. I am a senator for South Australia but I was born, raised and still have land, family and community connections in the Northern Territory—in the towns, in remote communities and even in town camps. It is my lived understanding, not a textbook understanding, of these unintended consequences. These are very real issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to an assessment of the view of some Aboriginal communities in a study from 1996. Yes, it was some 26 years ago, but nothing of note has been done since. The results, though, couldn't have been clearer. Nine hundred people in 100 communities took part. The result was virtually unanimous; a statistically undeniable 99.7 per cent were against voluntary assisted death. That's almost every Indigenous person interviewed for this research being against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coercion is a very real issue in communities, a very real issue for those who experience it, and must be part of the conversation. This has been highlighted as a key issue in the lively debates about voluntary assisted death. I'm not talking about those who just harass, intimidate and silence; I'm talking about those who simply have busy lives and have difficulty with patience, attention and advocacy demanded of someone who is very ill and demanded of them when someone is very ill. We need to protect those vulnerable to the threat of coercion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not alarmist to acknowledge that, should the NT move to legalise this, it will make vulnerable people even more vulnerable. Additional safeguards are needed, and they are needed in the Northern Territory. That's why I support this amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  Firstly, I would like to echo the comments about the respectful way this debate has taken place in the Senate. This is a bill that means a lot to the community I represent. I would like to take a moment to thank a number of people here in the galleries this evening: Samuel Whitsed, for his dedication and courage on this to see it through and for lending his voice to get this done; Caitlin Kearley, who has been in and out of the Senate for a while—thank you for your courage; as acknowledged by Senator Gallagher, Gina Pinkas—thank you for your advocacy; Marshall Perron; our Chief Minister, Andrew Barr; the ACT Leader of the Opposition, Elizabeth Lee; the ACT Minister for Human Rights, Tara Cheyne; Andrew Denton and Dr Linda Swan, from Go Gentle; the staff at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra Times</span>, who have never let this matter get out of the spotlight here in the ACT and nationally; the Greens senators who have passionately fought for the rights of the territories to be restored for over a decade now; of course, my territory colleagues in the lower house Alicia Payne MP and Luke Gosling MP, for introducing this bill together; my broader territory colleagues Andrew Leigh, Marion Scrymgour and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, for your support; and Senator Gallagher, for her advocacy on this issue for a decade or so both at the Legislative Assembly and in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight we finally we get to bring this to a vote. I hope we can continue this debate respectfully until that happens. But I want to take a bit of time to speak to the amendments. As Senator Gallagher and Senator Scarr noted, these amendments come from a good place. However, I would like to point out that the whole point of this bill is to remove the restraints on the territories, to restore our democratic right to debate and legislate on this issue in our local parliaments. These amendments add more restraints and go against the core aim of this bill, which is to allow the territories the same legislative rights and freedoms as the states—the same legislative freedoms of the vast majority of senators in here and the people that they represent in their states. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The self-government acts were always intended to allow this legislative equality. With this simple repeal bill, we go back to that, and I do not believe that these amendments are necessary. Overnight, I sought an opinion from barrister Fiona McLeod AO SC on the substantive amendment from Senator Nampijinpa Price. Her observations were that the definition offered in the Disability Discrimination Act would essentially render this bill ineffective. Under the act, and rightly so, anyone with a terminal illness could be thought of as living with a disability. Therefore, if this amendment were to pass, the ACT and Northern Territory would be unable to legislate the voluntary assisted dying scheme for the terminally ill. On another matter, the definition of mental impairment under the Criminal Code would create more uncertainty. Mental impairment in this context requires consideration of effect and context—in a criminal court case, no less. As McLeod said in her opinion, 'This definition's incorporation into the bill is unwieldy'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't be supporting this amendment. The bill is simple. It is about restoring the democratic rights of the territories. It allows the ACT and the Northern Territory to have the same respectful, considered discussions on voluntary assisted dying as our friends, family and neighbours in other states. This bill is about saying that the ACT and the Northern Territory should have the same right as the states in Australia to consult, to debate and to legislate on this issue that is very important to some in our communities—one that, clearly, involves tightly held and deeply personal views. I think we see that reflected in the way the states have done this, with the extensive consultations they have gone through. As Senator Hume talked about in her very moving speech, the states have significant safeguards in their legislation about who can access this and in what situation. I have no doubt that the territories would undertake a similar process. The benefit of the territories going last is that they have all the learnings from the states. While I accept that, around the world, there may be examples which are potentially shocking, we are in Australia. My sense is that the territories will follow in the footsteps of the states on this issue. So I urge senators to keep that in mind when we vote tonight. This is about people in the ACT and the Northern Territory having the same democratic right to make these important decisions in their own parliaments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  In contributing to this debate on the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022, I want to begin by acknowledging that there is an amendment currently before the chamber which purports to be an amendment for the benefit and protection of disabled people, in relation to a bill that is principally and solely, as Senator Pocock outlined for us, about the repealing of a piece of legislation that prevents the territories from engaging in a democratic discussion about the laws which govern them in relation to voluntary assisted dying. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In responding to the amendment and putting my position to the Senate, I want to tackle, first of all, the reality that many disabled people will be watching the debate tonight. There will be many disabled people across the country who legitimately observe this debate and feel either a sense of concern about voluntary assisted dying or feel support for the amendment offered to the relevant piece of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do understand the concerns held by some disabled people in relation to voluntary assisted dying. I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to go with a couple of friends of mine, who are amazing disability activists in Western Australia, to a protest they were holding against a film which had recently then been released, a film by the name of <span style="font-style:italic;">Me Before You</span>. It featured characters one of whom was disabled, and it chronicled the story of an individual who, on becoming disabled, made the decision to fly off to a Swiss suicide clinic and take their own life, because basically they couldn't think of anything worse than living as a disabled person. As a protest to that film, my colleagues were able to obtain permission to rock up in front of the cinema with tables and signs that read, 'Help me go to a Swiss suicide clinic. I am disabled. I don't want to live anymore.' During the course of 2½ hours they were able to raise over $250 from people going in and out of the movie, who not only were willing to give them money to go off to a so-called suicide clinic, but encouraged them to do so and thanked them for their bravery and courage in acknowledging that they were burdens, or were becoming burdens, to their family members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a story that has always stuck with me. I think it reveals the deep ableism that does exist in our community, that is perpetrated by decision-makers and perpetuated by decision-makers in this place. We must acknowledge the realities as we navigate these pieces of legislation. We are doing so in a broader cultural context that often normalises the idea that it is better to be dead than to be disabled. It is important that we acknowledge that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to acknowledge that, as has been quoted by other senators during the course of the debate, the UN Special Rapporteur on Disability has made comments to the government in Canada in relation to concerns over the administration of their system and amendments that may be needed to that process. Those things are right and proper to do. What it is not okay to do is to weaponise disabled people's lives and our safety and protection for political purposes. That is not okay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are senators in this place who have cited comments given to the Australian government in relation to our compliance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. They are right to do that. I would remind them also that during the course of the previous government, and the government before that, Australia has been repeatedly told by the special rapporteur that we are in violation of many, many articles of that convention, including, as I will bring to the Senate's attention, the reality that right now in Australia it is legal to forcibly sterilise a disabled person, under the law. The Commonwealth government, under both Labor and Liberal leadership, has repeatedly refused to take action to end that practice. So if we are going to quote human rights recommendations, there is a hell of a lot of work to do in the Australian space when it comes to disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sit here as a disabled person that has many friends who are concerned about voluntary assisted dying. I sit here as a disabled person who will be supporting this piece of legislation, who will be voting soundly in opposition to this amendment. Why? First and foremost, because this bill seeks solely to repeal a preventive legislative measure that is currently preventing the territory from engaging in a conversation around voluntary assisted dying. Once this bill is passed by this chamber it will be up to the ACT legislature, as it has been up to the legislatures of every other state, but not territory, to engage in a consultation process around the safeguard mechanisms which are required. It is incumbent on the ACT assembly that they do this and do this vigorously; in the NT to engage and to do that vigorously; to ensure that there are proper safeguards; and where there are learnings internationally, have them incorporated. Engage the people of the ACT, including disabled people, and of the NT, including disabled people in that conversation, and listen to those concerns. That is the appropriate way to deal with the concerns raised in the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposer talks about the need for consultation. Where was the consultation with disabled people in relation to this amendment? It is totally inappropriate, after the length of this debate, to come in here this evening and propose an amendment basically to block this bill, because it would make it inoperable. That would be the actual effect on this bill. To come in here and masquerade the attempt to block this bill as an attempt to protect disabled people and disabled peoples' lives. It is not okay, and it will not go by tonight without being called out for the cynical political move that it is.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TYRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this amendment, even though I won't be supporting it. I find it really strange that we are standing here debating whether or not the territories should have the option or not to decide something for themselves. The people in the territories should have the same rights to choose as the states do. It's as simple as that. It shouldn't matter what the topic or issue is. I find it sad that I am being asked to stand here and vote about this, that I as a Tasmanian have the responsibility to decide whether or not territories get to decide issues for themselves. If you hadn't guessed, I am 100 per cent in favour of this bill and I think we should pass it without delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are focusing on the end result of this bill, that the ACT and Northern Territory will legislate voluntary assisted dying. They're opposing the bill based on that, but that's not all this bill is about. It's about the territories' rights to make these decisions for themselves. It's not a surprise that this has become a debate about morals and voluntary assisted dying. I've always said that if I stay true to my moral compass in this place I'll be okay. My moral compass is that there's nothing wrong with making sure people can make their own choice, the one that is best for themselves and their families. They are the only ones who should be able to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here tonight, and I am so proud of Tassie and what we have in place. Voluntary assisted dying has been legal for one month in our state now. I know it is early days and there are still a few challenges to overcome. However, Tasmanians have the right to overcome this as Tasmanians see fit—without interference. I would like to give a shout-out to Mike Gaffney MLC for the amazing work he did on our bill. He spent years working on this legislation, and it was a very long campaign. So many brave people stood up and told their stories, stories about family members who went through so much, and in a perfect world they wouldn't need to. Jacqui and Natalie Gray led the campaign in memory of their beautiful mama. Their tireless efforts did not go unnoticed by the Tassie community. Jacqui and Natalie, from one Tasmanian to another, thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow senators in this chamber have told similar stories. Senator Hume stood up and told her story only a few months ago. It was powerful to hear from someone, who once voted against this issue, who has now gone through that experience and now will vote for this bill. It was an incredibly meaningful contribution to this debate. I thank Senator Hume for her courage and for sharing her story with us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't imagine ever being in a position where I or someone that I love is told that our time on this earth is coming to an end. If I was I would want the option to decide how I go. Spending months or years in pain with no quality of life is not something anyone should be forced to go through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand there are people in this chamber who aren't supportive of this bill or voluntary assisted dying. I respect your right to have that opinion. It's not for me to stand here and tell you what to think or feel. But, my thoughts are this: why does it matter to the rest of us if someone chooses to end their own suffering? This sky isn't going to fall in because John from across the road had the option and chose peace. Voluntary assisted dying should be an individual choice. It doesn't matter what I think, what the Senate thinks, what this parliament thinks, all that matters is that people are allowed to make the choice that best suits them, their family and their circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week there have been lobbyists running around the hallways of parliament—no surprise there. They've been lurking in people's doorways demanding them to make changes to the bill. They've been doing the rounds once, twice—maybe even three times for some offices. I don't think these people are even from the territories. I don't think what they've been doing is okay. Who are they to say that people in the ACT and the Northern Territory can't make this decision for themselves? Who are they to try and take away the choice for the ACT and the Northern Territory to decide from themselves when they themselves have that right?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For everyone in the ACT and the Northern Territory, I am sorry that you are being treated as second-class citizens, as if you shouldn't have the same rights as the states to decide for yourselves what is best for you. You have my full support. It has never been a question for me that this is the right thing to do.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  Let me start by, first of all, through you, Chair, addressing a comment to Minister Gallagher, because you have conducted yourself in an exemplary way throughout this whole debate. I note particularly the way you accepted and inquired into Senator Duniam's deep conviction but uncertainty in knowing what to do. You allowed that to be talked through. There are people here who are used to the behaviour in this chamber of not trusting each other. I reassured some of them that there's nothing suspicious going on. This bill is passed. The second reading was won. You won that. I thank you so much for doing what you did, in allowing Senator Duniam to speak, and the way in which you did that, Minister. I also want to, through you, Chair, acknowledge Senator Duniam, because something in his gut told him and he really came up and delivered. So I thank you so much for that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is different about this debate, I've noticed, compared with most debates in this chamber, is that people are actually listening to each other, connecting and caring. I am in a bit of a conflicted position, because I am strongly in support of states' rights but territories are not states. I uphold the Constitution. I am not going to go there. I have already acknowledged that this bill has been passed through the second reading and it will go through in the third reading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sincerely believe that this debate is not about territory rights. It is about euthanasia. As I said, we lost. I accept that. People here who will be with Senator Duniam, Senator Nampijinpa Price, Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Liddle, myself and others are making sure that their deep needs in caring for others are met and that safeguards are in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nampijinpa Price has throughout her career and in her brief time in the Senate demonstrated exemplary integrity. She is a woman, a person, of complete integrity. She, I and others are concerned about children. It deeply saddens me that we have to discuss that. Senator Steele-John has spoken well about people with a disability and Senator Nampijinpa Price has also talked about people with mental health issues. These are vulnerable people. What's next? The aged? The sick? The lonely? That's my concern and that's why I will be supporting Senator Nampijinpa Price and Senator Duniam with this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will, though, tack on something. This has worked well, this debate. Even though my position hasn't succeeded, it has worked well, because I haven't heard any talk about parties.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Firstly, I want to acknowledge the widespread community interest in this debate, as there often is in free votes and conscience matters that come before this parliament. As others have reflected, these types of conscience votes do often bring out the best of thoughtful, considered, calm and reflective debate around the chamber. I acknowledge with that the very strong and personally held views around the chamber divide almost every party in this chamber on issues that people care about—be they questions associated with voluntary assisted dying and/or the questions associated with territory rights. People have brought those perspectives to bear here in good faith right around the chamber. I think it is important to acknowledge that. Senator Gallagher acknowledged a number of people who are here observing the debate. Many are in the gallery and many others are paying attention. She also came up to me afterwards, having realised that she had missed noticing the ACT Liberal leader, Elizabeth Lee, in the gallery. So I acknowledge everybody else and, on behalf of all of us, thank you for being here, Elizabeth, along with many others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome very much the second reading vote that took place. It provided a clear indication of support for territory rights by 41 to 25 in this chamber, following the 99 to 37 majority in the House of Representatives. They were strong, clear endorsements by both chambers for the adoption of territory rights. As I said in my second reading remarks, much has changed since 1997 when the restrictions on the territories were put in place. Though I did not support those restrictions all the way back then, I can understand the sentiment that led to them at that stage—the sense that the Northern Territory was undertaking what was, in a global sense, an element of legislative adventure at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come a long way since then in this country, with all six Australian states having now legislated for models of voluntary assisted dying. It is no more a legislative adventure to pursue such a model; it is indeed common practice across Australia and in many other parts of the world. Importantly, each of those six state models around the country presents a model for the territories to consider in their legislative journey, should the restrictions in place be lifted. They present a model that didn't exist in 1997; as sound or solid as the model that Marshall Perron and Territorians legislated at that time may have been, there are now many others to look at and, critically, each of them comes with very extensive safeguards in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nampijinpa Price rightly brings to this chamber an amendment that seeks to address some of the important issues of safeguards. Senator Nampijinpa Price is a proud Territorian. She brings this forward, I have no doubt, absolutely in good faith. She expressed her views in relation to territories' rights clearly, strongly and forcefully, as she does on every matter that she speaks about. As Senator Gallagher, Senator Scarr and others have acknowledged, it is in that good faith that we should consider the questions she has brought forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Nampijinpa Price and Senator Liddle, in particular, rightly highlighted the crucial role of effective safeguards, especially in relation to the Northern Territory. We should not be closed to the unique circumstances of the NT and its vulnerable communities. They're right to highlight the paramount importance of having effective safeguards in place. And I trust that through this amendment being tabled and rightly debated and facilitated through this process, their message is loudly and clearly heard in terms of the importance of getting those safeguards right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are many safeguards to be considered in legislating for voluntary assisted dying. Those contained in the amendments of Senator Nampijinpa Price are about some of those that either territory must consider in terms of legislating a model. That is why I think it is important that if we are restoring the rights to legislate for voluntary assisted dying to the territories, it should not be in a manner where the Commonwealth seeks to part legislate the model of voluntary assisted dying they adopt. We should restore those rights, doing so confident that democratically elected assemblies in those territories will consider all of the safeguards necessary for effective models of voluntary assisted dying. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I won't be supporting the amendment put forward in good faith by my colleague. I do, certainly—and I'm sure speak for all senators—expect that the territories consider these matters thoroughly and embed these types of safeguards in ways that effectively work for a model of voluntary assisted dying. That is what we should expect of them and that is what has occurred across the six Australian states and the different models that they have deployed and put in place. That is what putting the rights for the territories back in the hands of the territories will enable each of them to do as well. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise on behalf of my party, the Greens, to indicate we will not be supporting this amendment. This amendment, if it were passed, would see the parliament restoring the rights of territorians with one hand and then taking them away with the other. That would be the effect of this amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge the lived experience and the truth and the contribution of my colleague Senator Steele-John, and I want to associate myself unambiguously with the contribution that Senator Steele-John made to the chamber. I also want to acknowledge all of the advocates, all of those who have worked for more than two decades to hopefully get us to this point. We should be clear that if this chamber accepts this amendment it will be completely undermining the bill. This process and the decades of work will have failed. That would be the effect of accepting the amendments to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the work of Senator David Pocock and his office in obtaining the advice from Fiona McLeod SC. It's worthwhile reading onto the record what is perhaps the key paragraph from that advice, which is in relation to the definition of 'disability'. It says this: 'Finally, the incorporation of the definition of disability into the bill will render the bill ineffective. A person seeking access to assisted dying will inevitably fall within at least one of the limbs of the definition of disability. By way of illustration, if the amendments are adopted, a person diagnosed with an advanced incurable disease, expected to cause death within months and cause intolerable suffering, the eligibility criteria under Victoria's Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017 and New South Wales's Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2022, could not be the subject of a territory voluntary assisted dying law.' There you have it in black and white from a senior counsel. You can't on one hand say you support territories rights and on the other hand accept this amendment, because the amendment fundamentally, comprehensively undermines the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish with this. This is not the right place to put these checks and balances in, in an amendment that was tabled only hours ago, without the consultation. It's not. I know that because in my time in the New South Wales state parliament I engaged in two separate attempts to put in place voluntary assisted dying. One was in 2013, which unfortunately didn't succeed. It took months and months of debate and consultation and detailed committee consideration with I think well over 100 submissions in that initial phase in 2013. It didn't succeed. Then again in the legislation that finally passed earlier this year. Again these considerations, detailed work with disability groups, the medical profession, the legal profession. That consultation will happen in the territories if we allow them to do it. That's where that consultation should happen. That's where amendments like this need to be considered. We should not kid ourselves: if the Senate accepts this amendment, they will have destroyed the utility of the bill and we will be back at first base.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:41</span>):  This bill is precisely about putting the rights back into the hands of territorians. Sadly, this amendment would do the exact opposite. It would effectively render the bill useless. We sit here tonight debating this piece of legislation which territorians have been asking for for 25 years. For 25 years, the Senate has made territorians suffer, because in 1997 this place did the wrong thing. It did the wrong thing by taking those rights away from territorians. Back then, 25 years ago, Australians knew it was wrong. Opinion poll after opinion poll showed that Australians generally, in whatever state or territory they lived, did not support the bill going through. Then, in the days and weeks after that original bill was put in, it was called the Senate's night of shame. Today, tonight, we have an opportunity to right that wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a short contribution. I know there have been so many eloquent speeches put on the record on this issue for so long. In my contribution I want to pay tribute specifically to the former leader of the Greens, former senator Bob Brown. He was here in this place 25 years ago arguing against the attack on territorians as this bill went through. It was not just the democracy that was under threat but the rights of people to choose dignity; the rights of people to choose to end suffering, to end pain. In his speech on the second reading, back in 1997, Bob called on his colleagues to think about the unnecessary pain and suffering that this place was inflicting on them. I can't be in this chamber tonight without thinking of how many people in 25 years have suffered because this place did the wrong thing on that night. This is about choice. This is about rights. But ultimately this is about human dignity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was called the Senate's night of shame for a reason. People were outraged. They were insulted. They were offended. They were hurt. They felt as though their parliamentarians had let them down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We may all have our own opinions—and we do, deeply held—of what we would do if we were faced with that choice. But Australians by and large have always accepted that it is a personal choice and that just because we are a member of the parliament does not give us a God-given right to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on somebody else. I know there are a number of important people in the gallery here, and I acknowledge Andrew Denton and Andrew Barr. But tonight I want to specifically acknowledge the long-held fight of former Senator Bob Brown. Year after year after year, since 1997, he stood in this very place asking for us to right the wrong that was done 25 years ago, and it's time that we did.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  This is the sound of democracy—the stridency, the pauses, the hope, the emotion, the respect for difference. Sometimes it concerns me that the debate about democracy calls for beautiful harmony. I like thirds. I love singing. I love the harmony that results when voices come out. But the sound of democracy is not always harmonious, and when it's at its best it's not autocratic; it's not one view over the others, with judgement everywhere. It's a multiplicity of voices. I actually said in one of our committee meetings this morning that the first time I heard the music of Shostakovich I thought: 'This is not the sort of music I'm able to cope with. I'm not able to listen to it, not able to stand it, because there's too much tension in the music.' It didn't sound familiar enough to me. I wanted sweet harmonies from the romantic period. But I learned to love it, as I've learned to love democracy. So, I'm very proud to be sitting in this chamber alongside colleagues who have given serious thought to this issue that's under debate as a matter of conscience and free vote for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to respond to the contribution of Senator Tyrrell, who asked I think a really good question—one of these fundamental democratic questions—'Why am I here as a senator for Tasmania making a decision about people who live in the ACT and the Northern Territory?' Well, you're here because you're a federal senator. We're a federation. And in what we do and what we're referring to here we are actually speaking into the space that's been constructed by our Constitution. It is a fact that the purpose of the Restoring Territory Rights Bill 2022 is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 to remove provisions that are currently preventing the territories from passing legislation which would allow for voluntary assisted dying. That's what we are doing here, and we are doing it because section 122 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth has plenary powers to legislate for the territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while this bill is colloquially described as restoring territory rights, ultimately it's not giving rights to the territories that are held by states. It's giving a right on one issue. It doesn't resolve the federal-territory relationship completely. This is despite much debate that articulates that this is just about territory rights. This is about one particular right, and it deserves our attention. It is the right to voluntary assisted dying, which in other contexts is called euthanasia. I've made clear in my second speech my particular view on this matter. I know that there was a vote last week when I wasn't here in parliament. I heard the contribution from Senator Roberts about the way in which that was conducted and his clarity about how this is going to turn out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe mine will be a strident voice and not a harmonious one tonight, but I think it is an important night to put things on the record. I won't resile from the fact that I represent here in this place the great Australian Labor Party, and amongst the Liberal Party and, dare I say, the Greens party and independents there are people of faith. They do wonderful things in our community. Their faith gives them action to do good works. They care. Many of our hospitals were first established by orders of faith. So I want to put on the record that part of this debate needs to be profoundly respected, even if you are not a person of faith. There is a faith position not shared harmoniously within each faith—stridently held views—but there are powerful, strong views, and there is tradition, there is dogma, there is thinking and there's a whole literature base about euthanasia and life. That voice, at odds with those who are fighting as wonderful citizens in this country for voluntary assisted dying, is a voice that we need to accept and live with. It is here in the chamber and it is in our community. It should be reflected everywhere. And that will be dealt with with another piece of legislation protecting people against religious discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are this wonderful multicultural, multifaith community, so I do not resile from the fact that it is a faith education in wonderful Catholic schools that gives me some confidence in putting on the record my particular view about voluntary assisted dying, which is that there are inherent risks that give me great concern. I want to make it clear that my view is that this bill is about euthanasia, and that seems to be the flavour of the debate that we are having around the chamber this evening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the contributions of senators not just in the second reading debate over the many months that we been having this consideration but the contributions this evening of my colleague Senator Scarr about 'in good faith' conversations. I will have a couple of questions to both Senator Gallagher and Senator Nampijinpa Price about my concerns with the language that is in the amendment, the concerns that have been raised about the definitional matter. And, if I may ask Senator Pocock immediately, in referring to what Senator Shoebridge said about the advice that has been received from a barrister that you referred to in your own speech, Senator Pocock, that perhaps it might be tabled, because as this bill wraps up this evening—and it will go to a vote—these are resources that become useful to those from the territory, whether it is the ACT or the Northern Territory, in the deliberations that will occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge my colleagues here in this place from the Northern Territory and the ACT in the Labor Party and those who are from the Northern Territory and ACT in the opposition and on the crossbenches. Are there any? Yes, yes—the agitator, the man who has done what he promised and brought this to the attention of a parliament. That is a good thing, because that is democracy in action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Pocock, are you willing to table the advice from the barrister that you have received that gives you a particular view about the risks inherent in the amendment that is being moved by Senator Nampijinpa Price?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I want to respond to a couple of points that have been made in the debate, particularly with regard to concerns about coercion. I do bemoan the fact—I'm in agreement with Senator Shoebridge on this matter—that there are things that are being brought before us at the last leg home that deserved greater and more careful consideration. It troubles me that there was not the opportunity for us to undertake a full inquiry. We do so much good committee work here in the Senate. It troubles me that there wasn't a committee charged with the responsibility of perhaps gathering this information and doing the good work that the Senate does before we got to this point on the particular matter that is being moved in this amendment. That's a concern for me about where we are in terms of management. I particularly think it goes to some of the points that have been made about people with disability, and the consultation with people with disability. Those points were very well made by Senator Steele-John this evening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know if Senator Nampijinpa Price or Senator Gallagher can answer this question, but I am concerned about the commentary from Senator Shoebridge, who has said this evening with great confidence—it must be coming from somewhere; otherwise you would never come into this place and just make bold assertions for grandstanding on a matter so important—Senator Shoebridge has claimed tonight that if the amendment of Senator Nampijinpa Price passes it will render it inoperable and undermine any bills in the territories I'm seeking clarification on that very solid assertion that you've made. Perhaps some of the answers are in what's been received. I understand that that may be in the advice that's received, and that there may be an answer that's possible from either Senator Nampijinpa Price or Senator Gallagher. </span>

I know it has been a very difficult time—a very difficult week and a difficult six months—as we all try and dig deep on an issue that requires us to use our conscience and reflect deeply on what matters in why we stand to speak for what we do, to support what we do and to say no to what we don't support. I respectfully say to my fellow territory senator that I don't support her amendment. I do believe, as I said in my previous statements not only in this debate but over so many years that we have raised it here before the Senate, that it is about the rights of the people of the territories. It is about the rights of the people in the ACT and the Northern Territory. To look at this amendment now, in my view, would only repeal what it is that we are here to do. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, it is very clear what the territories are asking us to do tonight. I take this opportunity to acknowledge former Chief Minister Marshall Perron—it's good to see you—and Chief Minister Andrew Barr. Listening to some of the speakers, I think it's really important to point out that yes, we do have a small population in the Northern Territory, but we have good hearts. We have great thinkers. We excel at so many levels. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only have to look at the COVID pandemic, when we were so fearful for the lives of First Nations people in this country and when we were so fearful for the lives of First Nations people in the Northern Territory. Since the former Chief Minister introduced the bill in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory has grown exponentially in those skills, that knowledge and the ability to make its own decisions. We have 13 Aboriginal controlled health sectors across the Northern Territory who ensured, through all of those practitioners, that they could go out to each and every Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, along with the health practitioners of Northern Territory Health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the people of the Northern Territory who put their hand up to support all Australians, and the first planeload that needed help, from China, landed in Darwin. It was our health professionals who carried the load for our country. It was our health professionals, through the AUSMAT team, who reached out to Christmas Island, where the first couple of planeloads went, to treat our Australians who were fearful of having COVID. That in itself, senators, shows the incredible weight that we carry as a small jurisdiction and a small population, and our ability to do what we believe we should do to help others. So why is it that we are constantly told we cannot make any decisions for ourselves—that we cannot have even the opportunity to debate an important decision? </span>

I have had sleepless nights over it for a whole range of reasons, not the least being my personal feelings towards it because of the personal tragedy that I mentioned earlier. At the time, I expressed my thanks to you, Mr Speaker, the Chief Minister and many others who helped me through that period. It was a very difficult time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators, I give you two examples—one for and one against. I give those examples to you because I have heard senators stand up here and speak as though we are incapable in the Northern Territory of being able to have a mature debate on all sides of politics. That is what tonight is about. Tonight is about the Northern Territory saying to the federal parliament: please, do the right thing. Let us make our own decisions. Rightly or wrongly, they are ours. Most jurisdictions in this country have done it, after the Northern Territory had led the way. Senators, I call on you to not support this amendment and please support the people of the Northern Territory.</span>

Both your contributions, for me, highlight when this chamber is at its best: it's the rare moments when we get to debate and discuss matters of conscience. It is when senators around the chamber who all have different views, different values and different lived experiences in our nation stand up and respectfully put them on the record and respectfully listen to each other's very different views. I've been incredibly concerned, over recent years, that having different values and views is suddenly becoming a dangerous idea in this fabulous liberal democracy of ours—that divergent views are somehow dangerous and debase us. But I think deriding difference is what debases us. What makes us stronger and more mature as a democracy is to be able to make our way through hard, difficult conversations such as this one in the Senate, because—you know what?—it's a hard and difficult situation and discussion for our communities. To come in here and pretend it's not is debasing difference, is not being tolerant of divergent views and is not democratic. These are deeply held values. They are matters of faith.</span>

But, as my good friend and always opposing colleague Senator O'Neill put on the record, these are questions that relate to faith. For me, I have been consistent in this place with this particular question whenever it has been before me.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we've been talking a lot about respect in the workplace and a lot about how we can all make this workplace a lot more respectful. I don't think we're ever going to make it kinder and gentler; I think politics and the things we debate here need to be done robustly. Look at how we've been debating the industrial relations legislation in this place and the other place this week; we passionately oppose each other's view on this thing. That's why we were elected to do what we do on this side and why you were elected to do what you do on that side. But we do need to do things more respectfully, and when I see the senators who are in my team being disrespected in the chamber for their values and their views then I think it debases us all. I thank you again, Senator O'Neill, for calling that point of order earlier.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be voting for the amendments put forward by Senator Nampijinpa Price. I want to thank both her and Senator Liddle for their lived-experience contributions to this place. For too often, I think, we've all debated ideas and issues without actually hearing from those who have the lived experience of how these things play out in the unique and special places that we have in this country. It is absolutely right and proper that this bill will pass tonight. It's heading off to the ACT and the NT legislatures to do with what they will. So in articulating her specific concerns and her careful consideration of the unique situation that is in the Territory, I think it is very, very sound for the senator to stand up and say: 'Do you know what? While you're having that conversation, can you just think about these safeguards for young people, those with mental impairment and the disabled?' The amendments are sound and thoughtfully constructed.</span>

                    </a>  I want to raise a point of order. I've been in this chamber for not enough years yet, I might add, but when we have these debates it is so disrespectful to interject. Whether you agree or disagree with the amendment or the substantial motion, Chair, people should be heard in silence and with respect. You can't on one day come into this chamber and talk about respect and then interject when there's a debate like this, which is very emotional. I had chosen not to speak, but I do sincerely hope that people will show the same respect. We have to continue to work together tomorrow, the day after and for years to come, so I ask you, Chair, to remind people of their responsibility to be respectful in this debate.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Senator Polley. I think we've all known enough lawyers to know that you can get an opinion on almost any issue to reflect your chosen outcome. That is not disparaging of the legal profession; it is actually how it works. It's the type of profession which articulates opposing views, and lawyers are very well schooled in being able to argue both sides of any given topic. They're very good at it. So whilst I respect that Senator Pocock has found a lawyer who says that these amendments will make the territory rights bill unworkable in the ACT or the NT, I'm sure we could find an 'opposing view', shall we say, somewhere else in the legal profession.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I know the clerks of the Senate very well, and I know that when they draft amendments for all of us, or when they draft private senator's bills for us, that they do that to the very, very highest standard. They will have drafted these amendments to ensure that if the Senate chooses to adopt them—and it sounds like it won't—that they wouldn't render the territory rights bill inoperable, because that would be against the intention of the senator who sought their advice.</span>

And it only works because we do treat each other with respect at work, and I would seek that we have more days like this. Thank you.</span>

The core of this debate that we are having is about restoring territory rights so the territories' can make decisions for themselves. This amendment by Senator Nampijinpa Price would interfere with that. It would mean that a lot of those rights actually wouldn't be restored.

We should be talking about the rights of the territories to be making decisions for themselves. The fact that the territories have different rights to the states is an anachronism. It's a random facet of our colonial past such that, as a Victorian, I have the opportunity to be part of that decision-making process to elect my members of parliament who made that decision, but people who live in the territories don't.

I also want to acknowledge the people who are in the gallery: the Chief Minister of the ACT Andrew Barr, Marshall Perron, Andrew Denton and the people that have been following this debate for a long time. The fact that we've got such a full gallery shows what a significant issue this is and shows that we need to be respecting the rights of territorians to be making these decisions for themselves. </span>

But she told me that she would have liked to have known that she at least had the choice. And I think it would have given her a lot of comfort to know that, as her body degenerated and failed her, that was going to be an option for her.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this amendment passes then people in the territories who have a disease like motor neurone disease will not have that choice, because that would clearly fall within the category of a disability. It is an insidious disease. You can't walk, you lose your ability to speak, you lose all of your ability to control your bodily functions and eventually you suffocate from that disease. It is a horrible way to die. My mother was lucky for someone who had that disease. She respiratory arrested before she lost her ability to speak and breathe. Please let's not take away the right from people in the territory to have their government debate and decide whether or not they should have the right to choose and what safeguards need to be included with it. Thank you.</span>

This is very, very real for all of us, and there is no judgement. We are best when we respect each other. That's when we're our finest. I'm sure everyone here and those listening would convey their deep condolences to you on your loss.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very appreciative, Senator Pocock, of the tabling of the advice, and I have had the chance now to have a look at that. It is a beautifully written document, as you would expect from a barrister who has given this as a pro bono contribution to our national debate on this issue. Can I just indicate that there are a few words in here that I would be picking up if I was doing some analysis in my year 11 English class, words like 'potentially excluded' and 'potentially affected'. It's a very useful piece of information, and I'm sure that it will be taken on board by the state—the territories, sorry; perhaps I do have an inadvertent desire for you to become a state, as well—by the territories and will become part of what informs their deliberations moving forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, I am not convinced by the argument that has been put on the floor this evening that supporting Senator Nampijinpa Price's amendment would be the end of any possibility of responding to the will of the people of the ACT and the Northern Territory. I also acknowledge the incredibly eloquent and beautiful contribution of my colleague from the Northern Territory Senator Malarndirri McCarthy. I wonder if I can again ask that question of Senator Nampijinpa Price: can you clarify for me, can you add anything to the debate this evening about why it is that you believe the word that was put in here by the Clerk—the word 'solely'—addresses the issues of protecting people under the age of 18 and those with a disability from being engaged in the process of voluntary assisted dying.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:22</span>):  I have stated my position. My colleague Senator McKenzie has also, I think, clarified this particular point. It speaks to legislation that has passed in states. It's almost a copy and paste from legislation that has passed in other states, and clearly the legislation has not rendered it futile for those states to carry out voluntary assisted dying and to legislate on voluntary assisted dying. I reiterate that what I propose in my amendment, my intentions that were provided to the Clerk, understood that it is not to attempt to render the bill futile. As I've stated, I am in support of territory rights. I'm also in support of elevating the human rights of vulnerable people. That is probably one of the biggest priorities I have in terms of decision-making in these chambers, and I have the right to do so as an elected senator for the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned at the state of the Northern Territory. I have witnessed the Territory government have put back in their hands the responsibility of alcohol availability in the Northern Territory. I have seen the vulnerable individuals lives in their hands and the way in which they have failed in their duty to uphold the human rights of vulnerable people in our communities, because as we speak right now there are children in communities who once upon a time, not that long ago, were able to live lives free of alcohol abuse. Those children are now suffering with alcohol abuse, with violence, with the threat of violence, with the threat of sexual abuse constantly hanging over their heads, and heightened states, because the Territory government—the Fyles Labor government—have failed to uphold their duty to protect the vulnerable to be able to live lives free of alcohol abuse, free of sexual abuse, because of the influence of alcohol in their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will reiterate, particularly for some of my Greens colleagues in this chamber, that I am putting these amendments forward to elevate the human rights of our vulnerable. It doesn't diminish the right for Territorians to legislate. It provides safeguards that already exist in other states. The Territory is not losing out in any way, shape or form. It will just be enhancing what the Territory is able to do, because all I am seeking is to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable members of the Northern Territory and do it at this stage. Nobody is missing out from this. Nobody is losing their rights. This is about the enhancement of the human rights of the vulnerable in the Territory that I have been elected, as a senator, to represent. It's as simple as that.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:37</span>):  Very briefly—I don't want to detain the Senate or those who are interested in this debate for long at all—I think it is important to note that this debate has been a long time coming and that the resolution of it is important to deliver to those who've been banking on it, so I will be very, very brief in my contribution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have circulated an amendment around this question, that the report of the committee be adopted. It relates to the administration of rules around access to the medicines used in the administration of VAD, bringing them into line with other medications through the processes available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration and its relevant legislation. It's a very straightforward amendment. Obviously, noting the scope of this legislation, it is something that is, in a sense, outside the scope of the bill that we are going to pass tonight. But I did, as I said last week, want to give voice to the issues that have been raised and that's what I'm doing today. It is important that we make sure we are apprised of all the facts and that all the safeguards are in place, much in the same way as we heard in the last debate about protection for vulnerable people in our community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I conclude my very brief remarks, I also just want to add my thanks to every single senator in this chamber. I'm very proud of the conduct of the debate that took place here. It was sensitive; it's difficult, and everyone has made sure that the views that were expressed were heard in good faith. I particularly want to thank Senator Gallagher and Senator Hanson-Young for so willingly accommodating this and enabling the amendment to be moved. I it added another week, so I'm grateful for your time. If we can do it in this chamber—if we can have a respectful debate in this chamber—I hope that our friends in the Press Gallery can observe what we do and not ascribe motive without understanding why we're doing it. It is important that we are able to do this. As I said, I am proud of my colleagues, who have very different views to my own, for conducting the debate in this way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments really do go to what is the fundamental issue before the chamber. That is, this is a bad bill. It is a bad bill that has not been properly scrutinised by this Senate chamber. It is a bill where unfortunately the job creators of the country stand united and say it will not have its desired effect, that it will only result in increased strike action and less jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first instance, this amendment will overturn the provisions in the bill that abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission. Today, in the Senate, as I questioned the minister in relation to the effect of the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and whether or not the Fair Work Ombudsman would have the capacity to undertake the same duties as the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the answer was clearly no. So why do we move this amendment? Because the building and construction industry in Australia is fundamental to the functioning of our economy. It contributes approximately nine per cent of GDP, it accounts for more than 1.5 million employees in Australia and there are over 400,000 small businesses around Australia that rely on the building and constructions sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, why am I most worried about the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission? That is because, shortly, the workers across Australia in the Building and Construction Commission will be handed over on a silver platter to John Setka and the most militant union in Australia. So, whilst, yes, those on the other side do have an ideological objection to the Australian Building and Construction Commission, I have to say he is already out there in South Australia and Adelaide flexing his muscles. Builders in Adelaide are very, very worried. I think the fact that the majority of the inspectors in the Fair Work Ombudsman are actually female and there doesn't appear to have been anything done to prepare them for the world of John Setka is a very, very disturbing fact. The fact is you have the EY report that clearly states that the economic impact of the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, between now and 2030, will be around $47.5 billion. At the moment in the economy there are higher interest rates and higher inflation, higher unemployment and electricity prices that are soaring. Put into that the effect of this bill on the building and construction sector and ultimately the Australian economy and, I have to say, you have a trainwreck ready and waiting to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the provisions to abolish the section in relation to multi-employer bargaining, when the employers in Australia stand up united—the BCA, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, COSBOA, the MCA and the manufacturers as we heard today from Senator Henderson—they represent the job creators in this country. What they are saying to the Australian Labor Party, as the people who represent the job creators in this country, is that this will not have the desired effect. They make it very clear that we all want to see higher wages in Australia. That is not up for debate. But they want a framework in which they can operate and actually deliver the higher wages, a design move to deliberately move away from the primacy of enterprise bargaining—bargaining at an enterprise level, which even Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard realised is the essence of the employment relationship. Why? Because between the employer and the employee, based on the nature of the enterprise itself, you can negotiate terms and conditions that are a win-win for both parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet when this bill passes, if you have 20 or more employees in your business in Australia you could actually be, against your will, compelled, roped into—use whatever words you want—multi-employer bargaining. I see Senator Watt, whom I put all those questions to, is out there telling people we've been wasting time actually examining this bill in the Senate chamber. It's ironic. Maybe Senator Watt doesn't know what he was elected here to do, but the last time I checked, when I flip open any book about the Australian Senate I'm pretty sure it says 'the house of review'—apparently, according to Senator Watt, we don't have a role in reviewing legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually take our role very seriously. The questions I put to minister after minister after minister were from employers and employees from around Australia, asking merely for some guidance in relation to the common-interest test: if we put this, this and this together, does that mean we have a common interest? 'That's a matter for the Fair Work Commission.' No guidance can be given to the employers in Australia as to whether they will or won't be roped into employer bargaining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard that there is a possibility that a business with 21 employees could be negotiating with a business with 200 employees. I'm not quite sure how that works, because I'm pretty sure the business with 200 employees probably has an employee called the human resources department, and for the business with 21 employees, I'm pretty sure the human resources department would be the owner of the business. The government's regulatory impact statement itself says that the owner of the business or the person they nominate will spend 4.6 hours per day. I put to the department, 'Where do you think they're going to find this 4.6 hours per day?' Is it during their working hours, so they actually lose profit, or is it after they finish work for the day, do the books, make sure the employees are okay, go home and make sure the kids are okay, look at their watch and say, 'Holy shit, it's midnight and I've got to be up at 5 am—oh my God: 4.6 more hours so I can actually negotiate and bargain with a business. It bears no resemblance to mine, but apparently it has a common interest.' I don't' know—you're in the same shopping centre, you're in the same suburb. I don't know. Certainly the ministers couldn't tell me, because, again, that's up to the Fair Work Commission. Moving away from the primacy of enterprise bargaining to a centralised wage-fixing scheme is, as Senator Hanson quite frankly stated today, only going to end in tears.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in relation to the common-interest test will ensure that the requirement for the common interest is met only if it is in the public interest. Why do I say that? People say, 'Well, hey, hold on: it already says "in the public interest" in the act. Ah, but the drafters are very tricky little drafters here. They have actually lowered the bar so the test is that it's not contrary to the public interest. I have some other amendments in relation to the common interest that we will be moving to provide more guidance, but this is a fundamental difference. They're lowering the bar so that it's not in the public interest; it's contrary to the public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we are inserting a review provision into the operation of the amendments made by this bill, based on everything the employers have said, based on everything that the government has said that this will get wages moving. They can't tell you when, no modelling has been done, they don't know whose wages are going to move and they don't know by how much. But they also expect more enterprise bargaining agreements to be entered into. I would have thought that it was pretty obvious you'd want to know: is the intention of the bill being met? On that basis, one of our amendments requires an independent expert, as soon as practicable 12 months after royal assent, to conduct a review. On that basis, I commend my amendments to the Senate.</span>

I'm very, very concerned, as the shadow minister responsible for building things and holding this government to account for building things—hopefully only for three years, Senator Gallagher, but we'll see how we go—that the abolition of the ABCC alone will add to delay and increase the costs of infrastructure projects right across the country. We know the Master Builders commissioned a study from Ernst &amp; Young, and the cost was calculated to be in excess of $47.5 billion to 2030. That money could build a lot of hospitals, a lot of schools. I know that money represents a lot of infrastructure not just in capital cities but right across rural and regional communities, many of them being rebuilt after devastating floods. It will be state and federal governments that will have to do the heavy lifting when it comes to constructing and rebuilding, and we'll have the infrastructure investment pipeline impacted by that amount of money over the next eight years simply because the Labor Party has an ideological bent on removing the ABCC. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember as a young backbencher—well, we'll say younger backbencher—in this place on the employment committee, we would have Nigel Hadgkiss in front of us, telling us of the horrific behaviour on construction sites across the country, day in, day out, by the CFMEU, or the construction division. I'm not going to bag out the whole CFMEU. I quite like the forestry division. I find myself often on the same side as Mr Michael O'Connor, and, Raff, you and I join hands and fight against our own Premier.</span>

                    </a>  Through you, Madam Chair. We often find ourselves on the same side of an argument, standing up for the most renewable, sustainable primary industry in this country. It is our forestry industry. It's not the forestry division I have a problem with; it is the construction division. And it's not just me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to talk about poor culture in workplaces. We want to talk about poor culture in organisations. The negative, sexist, bullying culture of the construction division ain't a new thing, let's face it. I come from Victoria. I'm old enough to remember the BLF. We we've seen this all before. I find it passing strange that both the Greens and the Labor party who, again, talk a big game on the treatment of women—you talk a big game, you want respect in your workplace, but only for certain women in certain workplaces, not for all women and all workplaces. If you did actually believe that, you would keep in place the organisation that keeps a union like the CFMMEU to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it's not for nothing that that's the union and the division of the CFMMEU that has a lot of court proceedings. It's had a lot of negative judgement calls—and not by the Liberal Party, not by the IPA, not by the National Party, but by courts, the judiciary in the country. So for you to make it the first thing you guys just can't wait to get done before Christmas is to give John Setka a huge merry Christmas. Sally McManus, put the jingle bell on it. Merry Christmas, McManus, you're going to get your IR reform. By abolishing the ABCC, you are going to allow that negative, sexist culture back into construction sites across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can carve it out of your multi-employer bargaining, but you're not going to change a thing for the women who might actually want to participate in this hypermasculine industry. Another thing we often hear from those opposite is them arguing and lecturing us on hypermasculine workplaces: 'Why don't you get some quotas to get some more chicks on your site?' After the Victorian election, I'm very proud to say of the National Party, the most conservative party in this place, that 50 per cent of our parliamentarians, state and federal, are women, and not a quota girl amongst us. You talk a big game, but this was actually an organisation that would assist to make the construction industry safer for women to participate—to be chippies, concreters, plumbers or sparkies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not really what you're interested in, is it? You're not really interested in young women having a safe, successful prosperous career in the construction industry. You're actually more interested in ensuring the negative culture that has pervaded that industry for so long is continued. Of all the ideologically driven decisions, the abolition of the ABCC just beggars belief. As I said, it's because it's working. The millions of dollars those guys are having to pay and the judgements from our courts are actually proof point that the construction division of that union is still not ready to accept men and women working in the same place and treating each other with respect. It's that simple.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted, in the time left to me—thank you for putting the clock on, Senator Hanson-Young—to contribute briefly on small business. I represent rural and regional communities. They are the backbone of our communities. I'm not here to represent big business.

                    </a>  But it's true. It is absolutely true what will happen, because they don't care about small businesses. They think a small business has 15 employees. Senator Pocock thinks a small business has 20 employees. That's not even a cafe in a country town, let alone the pub, let alone the hardware store. I mean, honestly; you need to get out of your capital cities and come out into the suburbs, come out into the working towns across this nation. Your small-business minister, when questioned on this in the other place, couldn't even name a small business that she'd sat down and had a conversation with. How offensive that is with the legislation you're bringing in that is going to severely impact their future prosperity, the prosperity of their families, their stress levels—because they don't have a HR department.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't care, because this legislation isn't really about small businesses, their families and the mortgages that they have on houses to actually keep their businesses going; it's about making sure you pay back in spades—I am sure they will be very grateful—the big unions who delivered you the election you desired, who have funded the Labor party's election campaigns. This is a very sweetheart deal for the unions, but it will have severe and significant consequences.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate Senator Cash's comments. We are the chamber of review. It is actually our job to come in here and put on the record the questions of the people who can't be here. I stand here representing rural and regional small businesses, construction businesses. It is my job to ask you questions. It is my job to hold you to account. It might be a little annoying, but on our big fat salaries in this place we have to sit a little late sometimes when we're radically, fundamentally changing our industrial relations system without a mandate. We're just doing our job, and we want to make sure small businesses and their workers can continue to do theirs.</span>

                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:12</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the amendments proposed by Senator Cash and by the opposition. These are amendments that are fundamentally important to ensuring that the legislation put forward by the Labor Party is not legislation that ultimately ends up crippling parts of the economy, ultimately ends up driving up inflation and ultimately ends up driving up industrial disputation and strikes. These are amendments that, if adopted by this chamber, frankly, will help the government in terms of its legislation. Critically, aspects of these amendments would help the legislation also to be at least more consistent with what the government took to the election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, there are a number of things that the opposition opposes in relation to this legislation. We have made that very clear all along. Indeed, we fought the election over that and we had fundamental differences when it came to issues such as the Registered Organisations Commission and the ABCC. Those fundamental differences maintain, and it should be of no surprise to anybody that the Liberal and National parties would fight to argue in particular in relation to the ABCC: that it is an important cop on the beat in the building and construction sector, that it is a critical part of ensuring that Australia's building and construction sector, which already is full of hard working men and women who also have a history of different sectors having unions, particularly, of course, the CFMMEU, putting much pressure on building sites—pressure in ways that at times has been called out by courts around this country, pressure in disgraceful behaviour, pressure that can lead to real dilution in terms of industrial activity and productivity on those building sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We very clearly stand by our position that the ABCC is an important and critical cop on the beat and that, without the ABCC, instead pretending to have some little committee that oversights things—essentially, the government proposed to have a committee rather than a cop on the beat—you'll end up risking a situation whereby the pressure on building sites is far greater. In my state, these concerns are very high at present because the CFMMEU has been taken over by none other than John Setka. You can walk down King William Street, the main road through the centre of the Adelaide CBD, and see the trams going up and down the main road. Guess what's on the trams at present. There's big CFMMEU advertising with a picture of John Setka on it. And I can only imagine what's going to happen on the building sites across South Australia thanks to that advertising. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Henderson rightly reminds me that, after some debate about the CFMMEU donations to the Labor Party in South Australia, and although there was an overwhelming lot of pressure that had to come to bear before Premier Peter Malinauskas did it, he did ultimately recognise that such is the appalling behaviour of that union that he gave the money back. He gave the money back. The South Australian branch of the Labor Party ultimately recognised that this union was so appalling that the Labor Party needed to give the money back.</span>

                    </a>  I apologise, Chair. The President actually reflected earlier this week that I'm quite easy to hear on occasion! But I will seek to make sure that my voice is such that I can rise above even my colleagues behind me. As I was saying, I acknowledge that even the South Australian Labor Premier has recognised just how destructive the CFMMEU are, and the association between the Labor government in South Australia and that union was one that he wanted to detach and did detach by giving their money back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, it's not about political donations; it's about the crippling of the construction and building industry. That is the fundamental risk there. The fundamental risk is that we see a situation whereby, without a tough cop on the beat and with these other reforms the government is proposing—the multi-employer bargaining reforms—we end up in a risky situation with increased incentive for industrial disputation and increased incentive for strike action, which all then piles onto a situation whereby you don't have an effective cop on the beat in the building and construction sector, and you end up with more strikes, higher costs, lower productivity and building costs going through the roof. And guess what that will do. Inflation will go up. Unemployment will go up. Job opportunities will go down. These are the real risks of Labor's legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worst of all, there are essentially a couple of factors. One is that, when it comes to multi-employer bargaining, the Labor Party went to the last election saying, 'We won't do it.' They went to the last election saying they wouldn't do it, and here we are, just six or seven months later, as they seek to push it through the parliament in what have been some of the fastest processes when it comes to substantive industrial relations reform that this country has seen. They are seeking to ram it through; they drove it through the House of Representatives with their numbers, and here we are in the Senate, and, tragically, it appears that they have the numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do appeal again to the crossbench, particularly to you, Senator Pocock: think again about the consequences of the Labor Party breaking their faith with the Australian electorate and proposing industrial relations reforms they said they wouldn't do—reforms that business organisations across the country have expressed their concerns about. Support the amendments put forward here by my colleague Senator Cash, particularly those amendments that relate to multi-employer bargaining, because, if you support those, you will be helping the Labor Party to ensure that they are acting in good faith with what they told the electorate. If you support all of these amendments in terms of maintaining the ROC, maintaining the ABCC and not imposing multi-employer bargaining, you will be putting in place a situation that gives the economy the best chance to continue to grow strongly, that gives the best opportunity for us to see a situation where with that economic growth we get the type of wages growth we all wish to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want to see wages growth, but you're not going to get sustainable wages growth in an environment where you have more strikes. You're not going to get sustainable wages growth in an environment where you have a weaker economy. You're not going to get sustainable wages growth in an environment where you have higher unemployment. To get sustainable wages growth, you need to make sure that you are driving true productivity in a strong economy in an environment with close to full employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party inherited an economy with effectively full employment. The big test over the next couple of years is to see whether they maintain that effective full employment. The lowest unemployment rate in my lifetime is what the Labor government inherited from the coalition. It's something I'm very proud of, something that I know Senator Cash and others on our side are proud of. We delivered an economy that achieved the lowest rates of unemployment in our lifetimes and, in addition to that, the highest levels of women's workforce participation, a closing of the gender pay gap—with a way to go, we absolutely acknowledge, but, importantly, a closing of the gender pay gap—with record levels of women's workforce participation. They are things we are very proud of. They are achievements that we left but, most importantly, they're a legacy we left that this government has inherited, and the legislation before the Senate tonight risks all of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It risks situation where the economy in the future faces strike action as a result of more militant unions being empowered to take steps and actions for which right now there is a cop on the beat. The unions will be incentivised to take those actions because they know that, if they take positions in one business, they are able to leverage it into other businesses across a different industry sector, and so there is an incentive for unions to drive, not just through one set of negotiations but across industries, the type of action—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment in relation to actually removing multi-employer bargaining from the bill failed, so what we seek to do with these amendments is to at least give a few more businesses in Australia a chance not to be compelled into multi-employer bargaining. These amendments would change to 200 the number of employees a business employs before multi-employer bargaining is able to be authorised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would we do that? By expanding the figure we can protect medium businesses, those with 200 or less employees in their business, from being dragged onto single interest agreements, which the government's own regulatory impact statement states—and this is very interesting—will actually cost between $80,000 and $95,000 for these businesses. That's right: the actual regulatory impact statement that the government has done itself has the cost at between $80,000 and $95,000 for medium businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do we say these changes are necessary? Currently, businesses with as few as 20 employees could pay over $80,000 when they are forced or compelled into multi-employer bargaining. In any event, the issue I have with this figure is obviously the way in which the department determined it. As we know, throughout the Senate hearings and throughout the committee process, when looking at how the department actually came to the figure of $80,000, they came up with a figure of $175 per hour for consultants. But the issue we then have in relation to that is this: they merely utilised a Google search engine and asked, 'How much should I charge as a consultant in Australia,' to estimate how much a business in Australia will have to pay per hour for this consultant that they are going to take on board. The issue I have is, when you go to the biography of this particular person it is quite strange. He identifies with all sorts of things—shamans, those who meditate, magicians et cetera—but the one thing this person didn't have was industrial relations experience in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have just made or are about to make some fundamental changes to the industrial relations system in Australia. The department, in determining the cost that will be borne by each business in Australia, whether it's a small business being compelled into the supported bargaining stream, a medium-sized business or a large business, has merely used a search engine term—'How much should I charge as a consultant in Australia?'—to come up with the $175 per hour, which is what this website recommends: 'If you choose to triple your hourly salary-based wage, your consulting rate will be about $175 per hour.' That's a pretty intense formula there, colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even more interesting is, once this was exposed, the department were thrown under a bus. They had to issue a statement saying, 'No, we utilised other sources,' which is a little strange because the other sources, clearly, were in contact with the shaman involved in this particular website. The shaman had said to them, 'The cost per hour for a consultant in Australia is $175.' Colleagues, do you not find it a little strange? It is spooky. The department were thrown under a bus and told to come out with a statement that says, 'We utilised other sources.' The problem is, the source quoted in the regulatory impact statement has the figure of $175, which is the figure of this particular website, 'How much should I charge a consultant in Australia?' So magical things are happening in the chamber with the shaman, and perhaps that's just one of them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other concerns, in relation to being compelled into a multi-employer agreement, is the impact on employers and the estimation of time spent by bargaining each day on the regulatory impact statement. The department have gone and looked at that and come up with this: 'The time spent by staff on bargaining per day is 4.6 hours, per bargaining period, for an employer.' I don't know about you, but I don't know what business with 21 employees has 4.6 hours per day to dedicate to the bargaining period, which could be 31 days. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At 4.6 hours per day, they now have to give up, on top of everything else that they are doing—it doesn't matter whether it's 21, 22 or 23 employees; they are all in at the moment. What small business in Australia has $14½ thousand—in this case, it's actually $80,000—that they can put aside, given rising interest rates, inflation and power prices? Apparently they also have $80,000 that they can put aside for when they're compelled into multi-employer bargaining. The money would appear to be the least of their worries, because, at the same time, they've got to put aside 4.6 hours per day, per bargaining period, for an employer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all about recognising that it is the businesses and employers in Australia that create the jobs. All this is doing is adding another layer of red tape on them. It is saying to them that the primacy of the relationship, negotiating at an enterprise level between you and your employee, to get the best outcome for both you and your employee, based on what is best for your business so that your business can continue to function, your business can continue to be productive and you can have a good relationship with your employees, is all about to be taken away from you and handed over to the one-size-fits-all approach of the centralised wage fixer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this amendment does is recognise that businesses are the job creators in Australia. They have told us. They have stood united and said, 'This is not good legislation.' They have said, 'We all want wage rises in this country,' but they have pleaded with the government, saying that this legislation is not the way to do it. This legislation will only result in more strikes and fewer jobs. When you have more strikes, your productivity goes down. When your productivity goes down as a business, it is likely to result in people losing jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the employers of Australia are standing up and saying, 'We do want to achieve wage rises for our employees, but this legislation is not the way you do it.' If you don't want to listen to them—and I accept that the Albanese government doesn't want to listen to them—at least then make the legislation slightly better by raising the threshold and changing the number from 20 to 200, in recognition of the fact that they are the job creators in Australia. They don't need to be lumbered with this additional $80,000 cost, and they don't need to be lumbered with the 4.6 hours per day, per bargaining period. On that basis, I commend my amendment to the chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:56</span>):  Multi-employer bargaining is the most controversial, the most risky and the most disputed aspect of these industrial relations reforms being brought forward by the Albanese government. It's controversial, in part, because before the last election they said they wouldn't do it. But it is risky and disputed because of the genuine concerns that businesses across Australia have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In support of this amendment, I say to the crossbench, the Greens and even the Labor Party: if you are persuaded to give multi-employer bargaining a go, start small and start carefully. By saying start small, I don't mean start with the small businesses; I mean start with a small part of the Australian business community to see whether the concerns that businesses have expressed are upheld or not. If they're not, then maybe you could come back and say, 'It wasn't as bad as they feared, and we can extend it elsewhere into the economy.' But if those concerns are upheld and you've started with a smaller cohort of the Australian economy, the impacts of your reforms will be less in terms of the detriment and harm caused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment seeks to give a pathway for that. It's a change that, in the negotiations that have occurred with the crossbench, should have been embedded, rather than making the tiny shift in qualification from 15 employees to 20 employees—the tiny shift in head count—which, for many small businesses who employ large numbers of casuals working across seven days and long hours, particularly in sectors like hospitality and retail, it makes almost no difference. This would ensure, fundamentally, that small businesses across Australia are exempt from this risky, contested part of Labor's IR reforms. Note that, by shifting it to 200, this is still headcount. So this is not FTEs we're talking about. The 15 was not FTEs, the 20 is not FTEs and the 200 is not FTEs. In each case, it is headcount. Because it's headcount, that means that a young student at school who might just work one shift a week counts towards the total. You could have several of those people working in a busy retail or hospitality environment, and that's a good thing—we shouldn't seek to discourage it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor's laws will seek to discourage that, because, if I'm an employer who wants to stay exempt from multi-employer bargaining, I'm going to do my utmost to come in below the headcount. So having a headcount at a small number like 20 means that you could work carefully to avoid that. It might mean you have to work more hours and that your family might work more hours. You, of course, could bring on other staff, but, particularly for those young Australians looking for part-time and casual opportunities while they're studying, you would deprive them of the opportunities because businesses will manage their headcounts to come in under those numbers. So by adopting this amendment, the Senate would be not wrecking Labor's reforms but safeguarding them in the way in which they could apply across the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does it need safeguarding? Not just because it's contested but because of the reasons why it's contested, as my colleague Senator Cash has indicated—that the government's own regulatory impact statement indicates the cost for these businesses of being dragged into a bargaining process they weren't wanting to go into could be some $80,000. That's just the direct cost. Of course, the indirect costs are so much more, as Senator Cash has indicated—the costs in terms of time for an employer to be dragged into that process, the 4.6 hours per day estimated under the RIS, running over the course of a month, all adding up. If you're running a small business, time is money. So you've got the direct cost and you've the indirect costs for a process that you didn't ask to be in, in the first place, but that under these laws you are being dragged into.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the credibility or, more to the point, the lack of credibility that underpins those costs and assessments—the fact that the government has formed these costs and assessments on the basis of analysis from a consultant found from a Google search, who it turns out is a psychic or a shaman. You don't have to be a psychic or a shaman to know that this bill will cause harm to small businesses across the economy. You don't have to be a psychic or a shaman to know that this bill will see small businesses more reluctant to employ Australians, especially young Australians. That's the harm we seek to avert and avoid in proposing this amendment to ensure that young Australians aren't cut out of employment opportunities by small businesses but are given the maximum opportunity to be employed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know and as we've explained, we have concerns about the whole process of multiemployer bargaining, as many businesses have raised and business organisations have raised. We have concerns about it because it ropes businesses into processes and bargaining arrangements that may not actually fit those businesses but which they don't get to have a say about being roped into, under the conditions proposed by the government. By creating that type of situation you run the risk, as I said in the earlier contribution on the previous amendments, of seeing increased strike action across Australia and increased industrial disputation, outcomes that would see weakened productivity across the Australian economy and weakened outcomes for those businesses. If you weaken businesses and create those outcomes, you end up in a circumstance where you have businesses employing fewer Australians, higher unemployment and fewer job opportunities, and when that all occurs you're not going to have the type of sustainable wages growth that we all say we want. It's misguided to go about it in this case and in this way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trying to rope businesses in and impose one-size-fits-all solutions is certainly not the way. If you look at the most recent wages growth data, it is through individual agreements and negotiations that the country has seen the fastest rates of wage growth. We know that, the more granular you make the negotiations, on the current wages data, the faster the wages growth you actually achieve and secure. That's speaking facts. It's speaking to the data. It's a demonstration that, far from going for the more collectivist approach to bargaining and negotiating that the Labor government is pursuing, you should be backing maximum incentive for individual negotiations for individuals or at least sticking to the individual enterprise level, a small business having those rights to negotiate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're fortunate to be in a country where we have strong safeguards and floors that underpin industrial structures. They're called awards. They exist there so that, if businesses don't wish to negotiate, the floor is in place. Of course, many businesses—most businesses—pay above those awards. They do so already. They do so in a range of different ways. But the floors and safeguards are there, and it is not necessary to drag them into these alternate processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Chair, I do implore the chamber and the government to think again about the threshold at which a business is dragged into multi-employer bargaining. If you want to give it a go, give it a go at a safeguard level that doesn't expose small businesses across Australia to this experiment that your government is pursuing. Small businesses right now are facing a ton of pressures. The energy price crisis that many businesses are facing is a huge impost on them. The inflationary pressure they're facing is a huge impost on them. The last thing they can afford right now is to find that they're in a situation with extra industrial pressures, extra disputation in their workplace and unions coming through the door demanding that they engage in processes that they didn't even want to sign up to in the first place. But if you insist on going ahead then safeguard the small businesses of this country by supporting this amendment that simply shifts the threshold from the 15 the government originally proposed and then the miserly increase to a headcount of 20negotiated with Senator Pocock up to 200, which would ensure small businesses of all shapes and sizes at least are protected somewhat under these reforms. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:06</span>):  It is evident that in the last couple of days we've seen what impact this bill is going to have on small business. I'm deputy chair of the Education and Employment Committee. We heard time and time again, although, in fact, it didn't take the full the 22 days—we weren't given much time, only 22 days, to inquire into this bill—about the impact that this legislation would have on small business. We could see it from the very outset, as soon as we started to hear about the gravity of what was going on. We heard from businesses across Australia, telling us loud and clear about what an impact this bill will have. There's no doubt that it's the small businesses in Australia that will bear the brunt of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this government doesn't understand small business. They don't understand the impact that this bill will have on small business. They might understand what it means for the union movement and the access the unions will have to businesses they otherwise wouldn't have had access to. They certainly understand that. We know 1 December is the first day of summer. Guess what? It's also the payday for the union movement because we know they'll get greater access to small businesses. We also know that with the abolition of the ABCC the costs that were awarded are not going to be pursued by the Fair Work Commission. The commission will not have the power to do that, so it's payday for the unions because those awarded costs are not going to be pursued. We know it's payday for the unions, but this is going to cost small businesses. It's going to be a big impost on small businesses across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's been drawn in to getting some amendments through. We've seen the lifting of the threshold for businesses that are included versus those that are not, from 15 to 20—well, whoop-de-doo, 20! That's as if that reduces the impost on business, if you've got a headcount of up to 20. Apparently this lot understand that, if you're a small business with a headcount of 20, you won't be able to afford $14½ thousand for having to hire the $175-an-hour so-called consultants. There's an acceptance on that side that businesses with a headcount of 20 or fewer won't be able to afford it, but if you've got 21, guess what? That's all good, you can afford the $14½ thousand that you're going to have to pay. But, let's face it, that figure of $14½ thousand was pretty rubbery, wasn't it? I mean, it was based on the clairvoyant or the crystal ball or the shaman or the magician that worked it out. It was a bit miraculous. Maybe this lot does believe in miracles! What happened is the RIS says that it's exactly $175, yet we heard Minister Watt in the chamber last week, when he was asked a question about this and he said: 'Oh, there was a bit of a mistake. It should haven't pointed out just that one source. It was multiple sources.' Minister Watt came in here and said that, to come up with that figure, they also used payscale.com and the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span>, who are a reputable organisation. They're the sources that they relied on to come up with the figure $175. Isn't it interesting that, when you go authentic.com.au, the exact figure that's on that website that Senator Cash was reading out before was exactly $175? Wow! What a crystal ball! Can someone get that crystal ball? Maybe you could use it to predict who's going to win the World Cup this year. Hopefully it will be Australia. That could be a chance with the way we're going so far. If it wasn't so ridiculous, then maybe we'd be having a serious think about this. This is absolutely crazy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Western Australia, 97 per cent of businesses are small businesses. They're going to be caught up with the impact of this bill. We senators from Western Australian have an arrangement. Senator Brockman and Senator Cash are here from Western Australia. We have what we call 'patron seats'. One of my patron seats is the seat of Tangney—a great part of Perth. There are 6,500 small businesses in the seat of Tangney. In places like Canning Vale and around Willetton—Senator Brockman knows these places—there are many, many small businesses. I bet the telephone has been running hot in the electorate of the member for Tangney. I bet that Mr Lim over there is being inundated with calls from businesses owners who are just trying to figure out what this is going to mean for their businesses. These are people that are busy just trying to keep their businesses afloat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone that's been involved in small business—and, for a short time, I ran my own small business; I ran it as a consultant—knows that it's tough. You've got to work out where the next pay cheque is coming from, where your next client is coming from and whether or not people going to pay on time. All of these factors are considered by a small business. You don't want to be also wondering whether you are going to get caught up in some industrial relations dispute with a bigger business. It might be a competitor in your industry. It might be a competitor that's under the same roof or in the shopping centre or the suburb that you're in—the 'common interest' or whatever it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the excellent questioning by Senator Cash last night and this morning, we're seeking to understand the guard rails to actually determine which businesses are going to be in and which businesses going to be out, what the definition is and who's going to be included. What we heard was just: 'Well, it's up to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. We're going to leave it up to them.' What if you're the small business that's trying to determine how you're going to make this work? I've got no doubt that Mr Lim, the member for Tangney, will be inundated with people questioning him, but apparently this government thinks that there's no difference between a business that's got 20 people in it versus those that have 200 in it—or 21, even. There's a big difference, and, when you're trying to pull it together, it's tough going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My daughter is 16. She's working casually for an employer in retail. She's got a regular pattern of work; she works every single Saturday. It's a great job that she's got. She's learning a lot in that job. She's getting experience. It's setting her up. When she finishes school next year and goes on to study, it will help her through her study. It's not a very big business to get lots of casuals in that sort of environment, particularly in a retail workplace. You might think, 'Twenty employees is a big business,' or 'Twenty employees is a big organisation.' Guess what? For those that are in that sort of sector, where you employ people for those shifts during the week, when there's a bit of a surge because it's a Saturday, and you want to have the headcount to be able to support the customers that are coming in there, you might hire those people just for that day. But you need them every Saturday so there's a regular pattern of work. Those businesses are going to be caught into this. Let me tell you: running a business like that is really tough. The last thing you want to be thinking about is whether or not you're going to get caught up in this union-attracting situation that's just about trying to get unions involved when you're just trying to run your business and make ends meet. When you're a small-business person, you're often the last person to get paid. You know that it's tough going. The problem is: this side over here, this lot over here, supported by—</span>

I rise to give my full support to this amendment. As I've said often in this chamber over the last 12 years, I had the great pleasure and misfortune of growing up in a small-business family. There was no Fair Work Commission looking after me  as a 12-year-old on the back of my father's one-tonne truck, delivering milk around a small country town in the seventies and eighties. But I learned a lot from that experience—the importance of hard work, the stress of owning a small business, of being owner-operators and having everything on the line for the success of that small business, the stress of—</span>

                    </a>  Senator Hanson-Young, I can talk for the full 10, or you can let me have my say, and you can do what you need to do tonight for this amendment. But, if senators here who will not support this amendment think that a small business with a 200 headcount on the books is somehow the fat cat, the big end of town, that again just shows the failed consultation process this government has gone through to bring us to this place tonight. Again, your own Minister for Small Business can't name one small business she's actually talked to. She's talked to a lot of unions. She's talked to a lot of organisers. She's talked to a lot of associations representing people, but has she bothered to even walk down her main street in Hobart and gone: 'Here I am. How are things going for you post COVID? How many people do you actually employ? Are you a big business? How will the decisions that we're putting before the Senate today impact your ability to grow and prosper and employ more people and pay them more money'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that this legislation before us is going to have businesses with 21 employees paying over $80,000 when they're forced into multi-employer bargaining is incredible. What margins do you think these families are on? We weren't the rich family in town. The newsagents aren't the rich family in town. The pharmacists are a bit richer, but they're not the huge fat cats that you're thinking they are. The fact that this Senate thinks that businesses that employ 21 people are the big end of town is quite incredible. It shows how out of touch you are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not too late. I was really buoyed by Senator Birmingham's contribution. It is not too late for the Labor Party. It is not too late for the Greens, although, given who they represent in this place, they do represent the big end of town and the big unions. But, Senator Pocock, it's not too late to understand that small businesses are larger than 20 employees. The risks of this legislation and the unintended consequences, because Labor hasn't actually talked to anyone, are huge, particularly in the high inflationary environment we're in at the moment and the energy crisis that small businesses are facing. It means that people should remember the first principle of government, and it's actually to do your very best to do no harm. The fact you haven't consulted and the fact you have quite inner-city views on what constitutes a small business and what doesn't, and what level of impact they can actually bear, is quite incredible.</span>

I know you don't like to hear it, but the RIS was clear: it was disclosed by Senator Cash's forensic examination of this bill, in the short time we've had and the short Senate inquiry we had into the most radical industrial relations reform for decades, that it was actually a spiritual healer that informed the RIS.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just find it quite depressing that you want to see the economy grow, you want to see workers paid more—we all do. But you don't do that by roping in small businesses with a head count of 21 to be coming up with a lazy $80,000, because it's just not there for them. It shows immaturity, naivety and a complete lack of engagement with millions of families around this country who actually run the joint, who have the guts to get up every morning and put the whole thing on the line—their house, their family's future—to run a small business. The entrepreneurial spirit that they display day in, day out is incredible.</span>

                    </a>  I have a point of order on seeking guidance from the chair. It is normal practice that senators are usually called from each side of the chamber alternately. Senator Hanson-Young has indicated on three occasions that she would like the call, and it has stayed over this side of the chamber. My argument, Chair, is that it should alternate. That is the practice. It is explicitly identified in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers'</span> in Chapter 10. The call should go to Senator Hanson-Young. This side of the chamber have had Senator Birmingham, Senator Cash, Senator McKenzie, Senator O'Sullivan and now Senator Henderson wants the call. That is hardly fair. That's five without going to this side of the chamber. The call should go to Senator Hanson-Young.</span>

Senator Hanson-Young had been seeking the call on three occasions. I ask senators to take their seat while I am speaking. Sit down while I'm speaking. It is my obligation to distribute the call fairly. I distributed the call to Senator O'Sullivan, previously, when it should have come to this side of the chamber at that point in time. Senator Hanson-Young did stand and seek the call at about the same time as Senator O'Sullivan. The previous Chair, Senator McLachlan, had advised me that Senator O'Sullivan was seeking the call, which is why I gave him the call without seeing Senator Hanson-Young.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to this amendment, as Senator Birmingham has pointed out in relation to the previous amendments, multi-employer bargaining will go through the chamber tonight. This amendment will make it slightly better for the small businesses who are not exempt from this part of the act. The definition of small business that's been agreed to with Senator Pocock, which I don't agree with, is of 20 employees or under. They were exempt from the multi-employer bargaining part of the act—the single-interest stream expansion. They're not exempt from other changes in the act, and one of the other changes in the act is in relation to the rights for flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is all about ensuring that employers are not unfairly bound by a decision of the Fair Work Commission relating to workplace flexibility when the circumstances of their businesses change. Currently under the Fair Work Act, there are minimal ways for the Fair Work Commission to intervene in flexible work arrangements made under section 65 of the act. If COVID-19 has taught us a few things, what it has taught us in particular is that employers and employees are able to work with one another to ensure that they can properly put in place flexible working arrangements that suit both parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all changes under the act, though, because the act now introduces a right to arbitration. What will now happen under the act is that, if the employer and the employee are unable to agree on a particular working arrangement, there will now be the right for the Fair Work Commission to intervene and arbitrate a decision on behalf of the employer and the employee. What is not provided for in the act is the ability of a business to request a review after a binding decision is made by the commission. What may well happen at the rate we're going—if you are seeing rising rates, if you are seeing rising inflation and if you are seeing electricity prices skyrocketing and getting out of control—is that the decision of the Fair Work Commission made in particular circumstances and then imposed on the business may no longer be fit for purpose in terms of the current circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this amendment does, Senator Pocock—it's a very simple amendment—is actually ensure that there is a right for the business to request a review after a binding decision of the commission has been made. That's all it does. The amendment ensures that it becomes possible for a business to revisit a decision on flexible working arrangements. This will mean that, if a business suffers a change in circumstances—and businesses do suffer changes in circumstances—they will have access to a review of any determination made by the Fair Work Commission in relation to their business. This, I would put to the chamber, is abundantly fair, in particular for those smaller businesses who may have less ability to keep a flexible working arrangement because of the nature of their operations, particularly if their circumstances change. As I said, it is a very simple amendment. It doesn't take away what has passed through the Senate tonight. All it does is give businesses that ability to request a review after a binding decision is made by the commission to ensure that the terms and conditions that they work under continue to be fit for purpose for the business that they're in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Birmingham has already stated tonight, multi-employer bargaining is going through tonight; it will shortly go through the Australian Senate. This amendment in some small way addresses the concerns that have been raised by business after business around Australia. It's in relation to the common interest test. When I've questioned the various ministers who've passed through the chamber during the committee stage of this bill, what I've been looking for by way of statutory interpretation going forward is some guidance in relation to what the common interest is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The common interest, as we know, is based on three particular tests. It could be a geographic location or it could be a regulatory location—businesses in the same sector or industry. But in this legislation there is no other guidance given to the Fair Work Commission for determining what the common interest is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, when we look at the geographical location, I put simple questions to the minister just to get some form of guidance for employers who may be compelled into multi-employer bargaining. If two businesses are in the same shopping centre, do they share the same geographical location? I would've thought I could get some type of indication, but the answer to the question was: 'That is for the Fair Work Commission to decide.' It's left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission, so, depending on the commissioner you get, I hope you don't end up getting different answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next question I put to the minister was: 'Could a hardware store next to a hairdresser'—so they're right next door to each other in the shopping centre—'be compelled to bargain together under the geographical location common interest test?' Again, I would've thought there was a simple explanation: yes or no. That does fit within the geographical location test. But, again, the answer was: 'That is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then proceeded down a line of questioning in relation to distance. If two businesses are within one kilometre of each other, do they share a geographical location under the common interest test? Again, that is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there was this basic question: if we can't determine it, based on it being one kilometre or right next door to each other, is there a distance limit for the geographical location test? For example, do the employers need at least to be within the same suburb? Again, I would've thought, when asking for guidance in relation to a test, that that would be a pretty easy question and that, were you to pass it, you would actually leap over a hurdle and you would be one step closer to being compelled into multi-employer bargaining. But, again, the answer was: 'It is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was question after question after question. Could any two retail stores be considered as having the same nature, another part of the common interest test? The answer, you guessed it, was: 'It's left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.' A butcher and a newsagency are both retail stores. Would they be considered as having the same nature? Again, it's left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. Would two businesses in the mining sector be considered as having in the same nature, even if their activities are substantially different? I would've thought there would be a little bit of guidance, perhaps, in relation to that part of the common interest test but, again—there was certainly a theme going on in terms or all of the answers—that is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, all this amendment seeks to do is make clear that the factors which see employers bargain together are more clearly defined. That is all this amendment achieves. So, when the question of whether any two retail stores would be considered as having the same nature is posed—for example, would a butcher and a newsagency, which are both retail stores, be considered as being of the same nature?—there are actually a number of factors to the common interest test that the Fair Work Commission would have to take into account. All they are is the history of the bargaining of each of the relevant employers, including whether they've previously bargain together; the interests that the relevant employers have in common; the extent to which those interests are relevant to whether they should be permitted to bargain together; and whether it would be more appropriate for each of the relevant employers to make a separate enterprise agreement with its employees. All we're doing is providing some signposts for the commission in terms of undertaking what is, quite frankly, a decision that could, or could not, see a business in Australia with 21 or more employees roped into multi-employer bargaining.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is not going to fix our broken bargaining system by adding more and more criteria. We have designed these provisions to stop the race to the bottom on wages. We want to see businesses competing on quality, innovation and ideas; we do not want them to compete on wages. This is why we need to give the Fair Work Commission the discretion to decide for which employers it is appropriate to bargain together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been listening here for hours tonight as senators have given their contributions. More broadly, the point behind this bill is Australians have been waiting for a decade to get wages moving. We have seen hour after hour in the committee stage of this debate the coalition refusing—and we know it was a deliberate design feature of their economic architecture—to support new regulation and legislation that will allow Australian workers to get reasonable wage outcomes, to fix a broken bargaining system, to put gender equality at the heart of our industrial relations legislation, to implement the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report that the former government refused to act on and to place job security at the heart of the workplace relations system. The changes in legislation we are debating tonight will reinvigorate the bargaining system by making it easier for businesses and workers to reach agreement, with higher wages and productivity improvements. All of the international evidence shows that when you have effective bargaining arrangements in place supported by legislation, you will see the benefits flow through wages and productivity improvements, and that is the kind of economy we want to see working for Australian workers and for Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only about 15 per cent of workers are covered by internal enterprise agreements at the moment. That has to change. That has to be a part of the story of why we have seen a decade of wage stagnation. We know it was part of the economic policy of the former government to make sure that wages were suppressed and that wage stagnation became a feature of our economic architecture. This government has made no secret. We made it very clear during the election campaign that we wanted to get wages moving, that we wanted to support minimum wage claims in particular, which we did. Do you remember the Prime Minister saying, 'Absolutely, I want to see wages moving.'? Absolutely. That is what the Australian people wanted to see, because our agenda was endorsed in May.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once elected, we changed the submission going to the Fair Work Commission on the minimum wage case. When those opposite were in government they had a whole section about the importance of low-paid jobs, a whole section. Year after year they would submit to be Fair Work Commission: have a look at the minimum wage case but there are some really good arguments for why you keep wages low. We on this side have a different view to that. We are ensuring that we are creating an industrial relations system that works for business, works for those low-paid workers in industries where bargaining has failed them—those feminised industries and the care economy that is going to be so important to the strength of our economy in years to come. We know the services sector is going to be a key part of the jobs growth of the future and we have to make sure we are dealing with the wages and conditions in those sectors. It is no good to have all of those workers suffering under poor wage outcomes and poor conditions. That is the point of this bill. The reason why we have sat here for hours on end debating this, arguing for this, with us on this side supporting it, challenging your arguments and disagreeing with them, is because this is exactly the legislation that Australia needs to make sure that working people get appropriate remuneration and recognition for the work they do and that businesses can thrive and innovate, and productivity can be part of the economic conversation once again. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Community Radio) Bill 2022 (the Bill) will provide greater certainty and clarity for community broadcasting licensing processes. It will support listener access to high quality and diverse community radio services as well as provide regulatory flexibility for the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every week, more than 5 million listeners tune-in to more than 450 community-owned and operated radio stations around the country. This includes 1.4 million listeners from non-English speaking backgrounds, listening to broadcasts in more than 100 languages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The community broadcasting sector exists at the heart of local communities by broadcasting local news, telling local stories, and providing a platform for local voices and music that is essential to a well-informed and inclusive society. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first measure in the Bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span> (the Act) and clarify that the renewal process for community radio licences is not a competitive process. While this has always been the policy intent of the Act, it has not been explicitly stated. This measure clarifies that, when the ACMA is considering a renewal application, it will only consider the current radio service and not a proposed new radio service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With this amendment, the Government is providing greater security and certainty to existing licensees. This will ensure existing community radio broadcasters can plan for future programming and infrastructure needs with greater certainty. However, this amendment is not intended to affect the ACMA's ability to refuse to renew a licence if it is found the current licensee is not providing a radio service that meets general community needs. As such, Australians will continue to have access to quality radio programming that reflects their interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second measure clarifies the ACMA's powers to allocate new community broadcasting licences and temporary community broadcasting licences with effect from a specified future date. Currently, prospective radio stations do not have advance notice to set up broadcast infrastructure and station programming. This has meant that successful community radio licensees have sometimes taken significant time to begin their broadcasting service following the initial allocation of their licence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment will allow the ACMA to provide licensees with advance dates for the commencement of services. It will contribute to the streamlining of spectrum planning and give prospective stations the time needed to plan and make necessary preparations to have the best possible circumstances under which to begin broadcasting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The third measure clarifies the matters the ACMA may consider when allocating a new temporary community broadcasting licence. The intent of the temporary licensing regime remains unchanged, and that is to give aspiring broadcasters access to spectrum in a fair and effective manner. However, the amendment gives the ACMA the flexibility to ascertain if a temporary licensee is not providing a quality service. The Government considers this will help ensure the integrity and reputation of the community radio sector is maintained. Consequently, it should minimise the risk of poor-quality services to listeners or services that don't meet the needs of the local community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">
                    </span>The fourth measure will give the ACMA the discretion to limit the number of temporary community broadcasting licensees that can share a particular frequency<span style="font-weight:bold;">. </span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has always been the policy intent of the Act to enable temporary licensees to share frequencies to assist with the sustainability of the community broadcasting sector and effective management of spectrum. However, this amendment is designed to maintain the integrity and reputation of the community broadcasting sector by giving the ACMA the flexibility to decide if a limit on a particular frequency is necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fifth measure will include deadlines by which late applications to the community broadcasting licensing process can be made. This will assist with timely processing of late applications, giving both the broadcasting applicants and the ACMA clarity about the process while safeguarding against the unintended expiry of licences. In turn, this will prevent any unnecessary disruption of radio services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final measure clarifies the community broadcasting licence allocation process. Currently, the ACMA has an implicit power to decide to commence a process to allocate one or more community broadcast licences, after which it must advertise for applications for those licences. The existence of an express power more clearly enables the ACMA to delegate the decision to commence the process to allocate a community broadcast licence. These amendments do not change the current arrangements in regards to the requirement to advertise for applicants, or decisions to allocate a community broadcasting licence to a particular applicant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to supporting the long-term sustainability of the community broadcasting sector. This is evidenced by the additional $4 million per year of ongoing funding the Government is providing for the Community Broadcasting Program from 2023-24. This takes annual funding for the program to over $20 million per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is a further step to provide certainty for community broadcasters and provide listeners around Australia with continued access to high quality and locally relevant news, information and content.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the many ways this partnership takes effect is through the work of Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through these bodies, the Australian Government partners with state and territory governments and a number of livestock and plant industry bodies to further our shared biosecurity interests and ensure Australia's world class produce remains in high demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Incursions of exotic animal diseases or plant pests into Australia are relatively rare, but they do have serious potential impacts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Detections of foot and mouth disease and lumpy skin disease in one of our nearest neighbouring nations has had the government and livestock industries on high alert. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government has taken immediate action to prevent these diseases from entering Australia, implementing the strongest biosecurity response in our nation's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This includes our three-pronged approach of supporting Indonesia's response to both diseases with animal vaccinations and technical support, stronger measures at the border and increased preparedness here at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why governments and industry bodies partner as signatories to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the worst should happen and an exotic animal disease or plant pest should make its way into Australia, emergency eradication responses are mounted and cost-shared under these deeds to give the best possible chance of eradication.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the past few years, under these emergency response arrangements, we have been able to eradicate citrus canker and three strains of avian influenza. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Varroa jacobsoni—a bee parasite—was also eradicated and we are now working to achieve the same outcome for its more problematic cousin, varroa destructor. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Four kinds of biosecurity levies provide an equitable way for all producers to contribute to the cost of the biosecurity activities and eradication responses that benefit their industry. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia levies fund activities such as biosecurity education, planning and surveillance, as well as AHA and PHA membership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Emergency Animal Disease Response and Emergency Plant Pest Response levies primarily fund industry contributions to eradication responses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They can also be spent on other biosecurity activities once these financial obligations are met. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An issue for Plant Health Australia member industries is that for the EPPR levy this alternative use is limited to purposes related to emergency plant pests under the plant response deed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the flexibility in how these levies can be spent to include all plant health and biosecurity activities will increase their effectiveness. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will achieve this by broadening the range of permissible uses for these levies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Plant industries have welcomed this change, as it will allow them to focus available funds on their industry's most pressing biosecurity needs, whether for exotic or established plant pests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, meeting response costs remains crucial—it is the main purpose for emergency response levies—and the Bill will not change that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will also modernise and streamline the AHA and PHA funding legislation, including by removing redundant or duplicative provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a complex provision for funding biosecurity-related research and development activities through PHA levies will be removed in favour of using PHA's more straightforward industry planning processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also simplify the process by which the relevant PHA industry member for a specific biosecurity levy is determined. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will reduce regulatory and administrative burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Honey bees provide valuable pollination services to a myriad of plant industries and the honey industry's biosecurity activities are now characterised as plant biosecurity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Therefore, references to honey in the AHA Act can now be removed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also allow the AHA Act to facilitate the levy arrangements that are likely to be needed if other response deeds are agreed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each of these changes will make the AHA and PHA funding legislation more effective, efficient and fit for purpose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will strengthen the ability of industries to invest meaningfully in biosecurity and help maintain Australia's enviable position as a world-class agricultural producer and exporter.</span>

                    </a>  The coalition will not stand in the way of the Financial Sector Reform Bill 2022 passing. However, we have to note for the record our deep concerns about the process around the bill. For the second week in a row, we've seen the government fly a kite on finalising the legislation to implement the recommendations of the financial services royal commission. As yet, for the second week in the row, we have seen a mad scramble, a deal with the Greens and a failure to deliver certainty to our financial institutions. Tonight the government are gutting their own bill. This is a broken promise from the government that promised to be collaborative, promised to be pro-business and promised to provide stability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We still have several unanswered questions to the government about the operation of this legislation. The inquiry into this bill acknowledged the potential consequences of the consumer credit reforms for small businesses in the sector and for low-income Australians' access to credit. It is critical that the government get the regulations associated with this bill right and not set protected earnings amounts that will leave businesses closing and consumers worse off in managing their financial affairs.</span>
