                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  Senator Scarr requested that I look at a second reading amendment that was moved yesterday evening. Yesterday evening, Senator Scarr raised a point of order in relation to the second reading amendment moved by Senator McKim in relation to the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Australia's Engagement in the Pacific) Bill 2023. Acting Deputy President Senator Hughes agreed to refer the matter to me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite common for second reading amendments to deal with the context in which a bill is considered rather than directly addressing the text of the bill. In this case, the minister's second reading speech explained that the bill forms part of a broader program to strengthen Australia's ties with Pacific Island nations. It is in order for senators to comment on that aspect of the bill in debate and by way of second reading amendments. Senator McKim's amendment is in order.</span>

But I want to start with some questions in response to an assertion that Senator McAllister made in her second reading contribution yesterday—that this sea dumping bill that we have before us today hasn't been brought forward to help facilitate an individual project. I don't have the exact words from <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, Senator McAllister, so you'd be welcome to correct anything I said there. But I think you were very clear that any potential projects were a long way away and that this has nothing to do with an individual project. So, I just wanted to start by asking some simple questions around that.</span>

They include Sea Store 1 in Western Australia, CarbonNet in Victoria, SEA CCS hub in Victoria and the Darwin LNG hub in the Northern Territory. I'm aware also that the Timor-Leste government had indicated their interest in exploring possibilities in their waters. But, as I indicated—or tried to indicate—in my second reading remarks, the nature of the framework that would be legislated if the bill before us passed would require, in accordance with the terms of the London protocol, bilateral agreement to be established between the two nations where a transboundary movement was proposed. It was on that basis that I made I think the self-evident point that that would take some time.</span>

We're aware of Timor-Leste's interest in converting the depleted Bayu-Undan field to a CCS project. Minister Wong has visited Timor-Leste and indicated that we would support their ambition. We're waiting to confirm their proposed next steps on that project. We would be guided by their priorities. That is of course entirely appropriate. We respect their right to make sovereign decisions about inward investment.</span>

Presumably we're going through this process now so Australian companies, with Australian investments, can import—you mentioned a few examples there—or export our pollution across national boundaries. Is the minister aware that the Japanese investors in the Barossa project have raised this with the Australian government several times? Is that the minister's understanding?</span>

I will reiterate the proposition that I put in the second reading speeches. This bill seeks to implement amendments that have been made to the London protocol, to which Australia is a signatory. The London Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was amended in 2009 and then again in 2013, to make provision for transborder movement of carbon dioxide and to create a framework to manage the placement of wastes or other matter for legitimate marine geoengineering scientific research activities. As parties to the protocol, we are seeking to implement the legislative arrangements that would allow us to respond to these amendments that have been made to the protocol. This is a longstanding process. It has been under consideration within the formal processes of the government and the parliament for some time. I understand it was considered by JSCOT in 2020. It is a longstanding piece of work that is consistent with our international contributions to a shared approach to managing marine environments. As I said in my second reading speech, if the bill were not introduced, there would be no regulatory framework to deal with these kinds of issues at all. The consequence of that is that operators, researchers and proponents could start looking for loopholes and create their own initiatives and their own frameworks without government oversight, and that is the motivation for the government bringing the bill forward. </span>

Perhaps I'll step through this with you then, because I think a lot of that information is publicly available and has been reported on by the media. I'll get back to the Sunrise project and Woodside's comments, which have been made over a number of years, because as I'm sure you're aware the Sunrise project is a very complicated one. The energy economics of it aren't that straightforward.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just deal with the Barossa project for a moment. Once the safeguard legislation was passed by this chamber, there was what was described by the media as a 'broadside' by a number of Japanese investors into the changes to the safeguard mechanism and how they might impact investment in their Barossa project. I think they described it in the strongest possible terms as 'a betrayal' of the relationship between Australia and Japan, which obviously put significant pressure on your government, including various ministers. For example, Michael Smith, the North Asia correspondent for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fin Review</span>, wrote that Australia is no longer Japan's most trusted LNG supplier. He quoted Japan's Institute of Energy Economics chief executive as well as comments from various companies. Part of that article was clearly referring to a request to the federal government from Japan—and I presume that's the Japanese government—that the Australian government exempt Santos's $5.8 billion Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea from the safeguard mechanism. He then asked that the Albanese government help Japanese operators pay for carbon credits or develop carbon storage that they would need to meet the new emissions targets. I reiterate that this was on 5 July. In that same article, a spokeswoman for energy and climate change minister Chris responded:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the government was investing in the regulation and administration of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), which would help operators earn carbon credits under the safeguard mechanism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"While the safeguard mechanism provides an incentive for new CCUS projects to meet abatement goals, it also opens the possibility for the earning of Safeguard Mechanism Credits if CCUS projects are successful in lowering emissions below baselines," …</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This article also references concerns raised directly with the Albanese government in March—that's three months prior to that—by INPEX Corporation about changes around Australia's energy and carbon policy. So that was on 5 July. Not long after that, it was reported in a number of news articles that the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Mr Chris Bowen had—following this broadside, this accusation of betrayal by the Australian government—headed to Japan in an attempt to repair bilateral relations after officials in Tokyo voiced concerns around Australia's future as a reliable LNG gas exporter. The article I am referring to here—and I can provide the minister with a copy of it—was by Amanda Battersby out of Singapore. She got a quote from APPEA that said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and they talked up the need for more investment in CCUS.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A day after these articles, on 25 July, Michael Smith, North Asia correspondent, clearly got access to Minister Bowen directly, following his coverage of this broadside by the Japanese government and Japanese investors. This article said Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen had told Japan and South Korea there would be no exemptions from Labor's emissions policy, and that he doesn't believe it threatens their energy security or trading relationships. But:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Bowen also said Labor supported special legislation that would allow Santos to send carbon dioxide from its $5.8 billion Barossa project across an international border to the Timor Sea. He acknowledged the project, which Japan wants to be exempted from the new rules, was reliant on carbon capture utilisation and storage.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I've already answered the question by explaining to you that the government's motivation in bringing forward the legislation is to meet our obligations as a party to the London protocol, to participate in global efforts to establish regulatory frameworks that are predictable and certain, and to meet environmental standards that have been agreed with our global partners. I think your question and its very long preamble seek to draw a link between the safeguard mechanism—which imposes stringent obligations on large projects, including gas projects—and carbon capture and storage. In many ways, that's quite straightforward, isn't it? The IEA makes it very clear that CCS will be a part of the broad mix of technologies necessary to make it to net zero. Those broad conclusions are echoed by the IPCC and most other international energy analyses of our potential pathways to net zero, and Australia doesn't dispute this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the question, which will be a product of the changing role and cost profiles of different technologies, is which of the various technologies available to us will prevail in what the relative weight of different technologies on our path to net zero looks and feels like. We are focused, in our role as government, on making sure that projects that are investable and that are deemed to be commercial by proponents have regulatory certainty now that they face these emissions constraints that you referred to in your preamble. Ratifying the London protocol's amendments is part of our broader approach to CCS and CCUS regulation. It's pragmatic and sensible. We made $12 million available in the last budget to review the environmental management regime for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This review seeks to ensure that the regulatory regime for offshore CCS projects appropriately manages risks to the marine environment and to workforce health and safety. The review will identify opportunities to more effectively plan for and regulate the decommissioning of offshore CCS projects. It will look at regulatory requirements relating to long-term liability and monitoring of sequestered carbon dioxide and will examine opportunities to provide greater regulatory and administrative certainty and efficiency for carbon capture and storage projects in Commonwealth waters. So if your question is, 'Does the government consider that CCS may play a role in supporting covered entities to meet their obligations under the safeguard agreement?' the answer is yes.</span>

It's obvious to everyone that this is the legislation Mr Bowen was talking about on 26 July. It was obvious to all the groups who made submissions to the Senate inquiry process, including the Australian Marine Conservation Society, the Australian institute, Surfrider Foundation and the Northern Territory Environment Centre. There were a number of people I know you respect and have worked with over many years who clearly have tied this to the Barossa project. I'm disappointed you couldn't answer that simple question. Perhaps your advisers or I could just give you a copy of this article so you can at least look at it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That isn't where Mr Bowen finished in this article, by the way. On the second page, when dealing with accusations around the Japanese government's concerns, especially in relation to one investor, JERA, the article said of Mr Bowen:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We think that is fair. If we are requiring companies to meet ambitious emissions reduction targets, and they have a way to do it, we can help them achieve it. That legislation is making its way through parliament."</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This chamber had an extensive debate about imposing obligations on projects that emitted large volumes of emissions. Your party voted for those requirements to be placed on large projects. This government accepts that, in some examples, it may be that a CCS project is the means by which those projects meet their obligations. If they seek to do so through that technology, if that's cost-effective and commercial and stacks up for them in the context of their project, then, yes, we want it to be properly regulated.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to the effect of the legislation before us. It puts in place the framework set out in the London protocol, and that framework requires a number of important environmental protections and other kinds of assessments to take place before any permit may be issued in relation to the transborder movement of carbon dioxide. It also requires an agreement to be put in place between the two countries that would be impacted by any such movement. These are important baseline regulatory arrangements that are necessary to respond to the possibility of projects of this kind. In the absence of these kinds of regulatory arrangements, we have an unregulated space, and I challenge you to explain why that would be a better outcome than having a clear regulatory environment that implements the environmental protections that the countries of the world have agreed to when they signed onto the London protocol.</span>

This is just one article—I've got others here—where he's made it very clear that the government is going to be passing enabling legislation to facilitate the Barossa Gas Project. Clearly, he said, 'We have introduced the legislation to enable that to occur specifically related to the Barossa project'—the $5.8 billion Barossa project. You've refused to answer that. I don't know why. I think it's pretty obvious: it doesn't look good for your government that you're refusing to answer the most simple question. I think a bit of honesty and transparency goes a long way. It's not a gotcha moment; I think this is pretty black and white.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me try a different tack. If you genuinely don't know, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't know that this is the legislation Mr Bowen is referring to to facilitate the transport of CO2 across international boundaries into Timor-Leste, into the Bayu-Undan field, a depleted field in the Timor Sea. This was in July, and it's been going through the House and of course it's here now. I can't see any other legislation before us that might be doing that, so an intelligent person would say, 'Yes, this must be it.' Perhaps you could offer what other legislation is the minister referring to there if it's not this?</span>

The motivation for bringing forward the legislation is to implement the London protocol. It's a policy reform that's been going on for some time. Australia supported both of the amendments that I referred to earlier at the time that they were agreed by the London protocol contracting parties back in 2009 and 2013. Then, in 2020, JSCOT recommended that these were minor treaty actions and that binding treaty action may be taken.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also made it clear that the government is in the process of improving and strengthening and clarifying the regulatory arrangements that exist for carbon capture and storage and that the legislation before you is part of a broader suite of actions being undertaken by this government to do that. It's quite clear that the arrangements we are putting in place support projects of the kind that you describe. It is logically true. What I'm not going to do is comment on comments made by other ministers when I am not in a position to know what was in their minds at the time that they made them, but you may proceed on the basis that the motivation for this is to implement our international obligations and to create a predictable, certain and robust regulatory framework for any projects of this kind that are proposed.</span>

Could you answer that question, please? Could you get me an answer rather than avoiding it for the seventh time? I am allowed a second question. I'll try a different tact to get an answer to a very simple question, even though I suspect you know the answer. Has the environment minister's office been in discussions with Mr Bowen's office about the timing of this legislation and the drafting of this legislation to facilitate the Barossa gas project—or not even to facilitate the Barossa gas project but just discussions in Mr Bowen's office about this?</span>

The advice we received from the department is that those amendments are not required, because the effect of those is already reflected in the legislation. I can step through that in a moment. It would require me to find the relevant piece of paper. Essentially, as I understand it, your proposed amendment seeks to replicate matters which are laid out in the protocol itself. The advice from the department is that that is redundant and that repeating it in our legislation risks having our legislation become outdated should the protocol itself be updated. The legislation as proposed before the chamber at the moment references back to the London protocol and the documents that are attached to it, and it's for that reason that we don't consider it is legally required in the legislation we're now considering.</span>

This minister may not be aware that the environment minister's office had given undertakings to third parties that they would. Here we have just one example of how badly this government has managed this piece of legislation; how appallingly the environment minister has treated the environment sector and those concerns about this issue. For months and months the environment minister's office has been telling environmental groups, community interested organisations and stakeholders that she was busy convincing her colleagues that this bill required amendment. How is anyone meant to believe what comes out of that minister's office from here on in?</span>

Could the minister please inform the Senate what, if any, amendments were being considered by the department or the minister's office to deal with the concerns raised by civil society and interested stakeholders?</span>

We always appreciate hearing from the environment groups. The minister's office did seek advice from the department about many of the amendments that were proposed, either directly or through the Senate inquiry processes, and has come to the conclusion, on a range of matters, including the one that you raised in your earlier question, that amendments to the bill are not required, because the way the bill is drafted references so directly to the London protocol that replicating the features of the London protocol in the legislation itself is not necessary and has no additional benefits but does in fact introduce legal risks.</span>

Could I ask if the minister for environment sought advice from her department about certain amendments, as referenced. We've heard just now that a number of amendments were considered, which the department looked at, advised on, went back to the minister with and gave the minister advice about. I want to know whether any other ministers within the Albanese government were also given advice about these possible amendments.</span>

This is a bill that interacts with other portfolios. I am advised that Minister Plibersek and her staff have engaged with their colleagues, as you would expect, in relation to this bill. But the government doesn't propose to bring forward amendments to this bill. We've contemplated the many options that have been proposed by participants in the public debate around this bill and have concluded that we are satisfied with the bill as it is presented and as it is before you now in the Senate.</span>

It is the policy of the government to ratify the amendments that have been made to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. These matters have been on foot since 2009. As I've indicated, they were initiated under the previous government. We are getting on with the ordinary business of government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  I have a follow-up question in relation to Senator Hanson-Young's question. I was wondering if this might have something to do with the timing of this bill, Minister, and I'd like to get your view on this. On 8 October, it was reported that Australia and Japan had met to pledge deeper cooperation on energy security and climate change during high-level government talks, where Labor sought to reassure Tokyo that future LNG supplies will not be threatened by its green energy policies. That included these talks and Japan's Minister for the Economy, Trade and Industry, who, at the time, talked to the Australian media and stressed the need for Australia to have a stable investment environment. He discussed Labor's emissions reduction rules on future LNG projects, including the safeguard mechanism, and he discussed a number of issues, including CCUS, in talks with our trade minister, Senator Don Farrell, our energy minister, Mr Chris Bowen, and our resources minister, Ms Madeleine King. Interestingly, although he had previously raised concerns, which I mentioned in my earlier questions about Australia's relationship with Japan, these concerns weren't raised again following this meeting. In fact, he made a comment that, following the meeting with Senator Farrell, Mr Bowen and Ms King, he was now confident of a win-win scenario between Japan and Australia in relation to LNG investment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I could read you more about these meetings, but, firstly, were you aware of these high-level talks between senior ministers in our government, which I note didn't include the environment minister but did include the resources minister, the trade minister and the climate change minister? Were you aware of those talks, and was the timing of those talks anything to do with the introduction of this bill through the Senate this week?</span>

Yes, I was aware that an extremely important meeting was taking place between the Japanese minister and three Australian ministers. And that is entirely appropriate; we have a deep and longstanding partnership, as energy exporters to them, with the nation of Japan. It's a really valuable partnership for Australia. Incidentally, it's by that well-practised pathway over many years in that business and diplomatic relationship which, potentially, lays the foundation for some of the emerging industries that may prove very important for Australia and for the globe—particularly in relation to the production of hydrogen and its derivatives. So, yes, of course we pay attention to and invest in the relationship with Japan. I'm not aware of all the details that were discussed in that meeting between those ministers, but I am pleased that the outcome of those discussions was positive. Of course it's an important relationship and of course this government will invest time in it.</span>

To start with the technology: for many years now, for reasons that are actually unrelated to climate action, oil and gas projects have, for various reasons, been operationally required to eject carbon dioxide into geological formations. The advice I have is that the experience through the oil and gas sector is that the placement of carbon dioxide into geological formations is relatively stable. There's been discussion now for some decades about whether a process of this kind could be used to take carbon dioxide that's produced as a by-product of energy generation activities or industrial activities and similarly store it underground so as to prevent it being released into the atmosphere. The reason for doing so would be to minimise the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and the reason we seek to do that is the relationship between the release of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere and global warming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulatory environment is important because there are a range of impacts that you might need to consider when you're undertaking projects of that kind. They would be, potentially, impacts on the marine environment, impacts on worker health and safety and other kinds of questions that might be necessary to manage if you were undertaking a project of any kind. It's important to have clear how those issues would be managed for projects of this kind. Australia has its own regulatory arrangements for projects of this kind that are conducted within Australian waters. The bill before us seeks to create a framework to establish the regulatory environment where there is a transboundary movement of carbon dioxide from one territory to another.</span>

Basically the bill allows the government to create a regulatory system to place waste into the sea for scientific research purposes—for example, research into ocean fertilisation which aims to remove carbon dioxide from the ocean. Of our carbon dioxide, only three per cent is created by humans; 97 per cent of carbon dioxide comes from the oceans, from the soils and from natural resources. I just don't understand why you're going to take carbon dioxide—it's a natural gas which is 0.004 per cent of all the natural gases in the world, and you're actually terrified and taking it out, and you're going to have to pump it into the seabed. I'm sorry, but I don't understand what your regulatory system is here. You're saying that it's going to help our environment. Usually, when the oceans will release carbon dioxide and take it in depends on the heating and cooling of our oceans. So how is this going to actually help?</span>

One is projects associated with carbon capture and storage in undersea formations. This was the subject of a 2009 amendment to the London protocol, and the legislation seeks to create a regulatory arrangement for that when it requires the transborder movement of carbon dioxide.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also seeks to deal with a different proposition. This was the subject of a 2013 amendment to the London protocol. It relates to marine geoengineering activities. This allows for the placing of waste or other matter for a marine geoengineering activity such as ocean fertilisation, for legitimate scientific research. It's a really important point, because it's for research purposes only. It's not imagined that it would be permitted at anything like commercial scale at this point in time. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the technologies that people are interested in investigating is ocean fertilisation. There are good reasons to regulate that, because we're not yet certain what kinds of impacts that ocean fertilisation might have in addition to its climate benefits. We should always be cautious about these technologies. It's at research scale, and the amendment before us seeks to create a regulatory framework to manage research projects of that kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will indicate that the London protocol is also looking at potential other future listings, including microbubbles—injecting tiny bubbles into the ocean surface to increase sunlight reflectivity—and marine cloud brightening, or seeding, which is injecting sea salt into cloud updrafts to reflect sunlight back into space. These are all research propositions. They're not commercial. But it is important that there is a regulatory framework to manage them so that we don't have unintended consequences on ocean environments. Because the ocean is a shared resource, it makes sense that that's done through an international protocol.</span>

It has been around for 50 years. There hasn't been a particular need to do large-scale carbon capture and storage until recent times, when we have started to think about carbon abatement. Globally, I understand, there are around 35 commercial CCS or CCUS projects, which capture nearly 45 megatonnes of CO2 each year. Since 2022 there has been an increase of 44 per cent in the total capacity of CCS projects in development around the world—</span>

Basically you're introducing this if they want to carry on a business here in Australia. Is that the case? Do they have a choice to do carbon capture if they want to do oil or gas in Australia?

Some months ago we had a debate in this chamber about the safeguard mechanism. I'm not sure if you were here for that debate. At that time we made arrangements to establish binding emissions constraints on large Australian projects, and those projects are responsible for coming to their own commercial decisions about how best to reduce the emissions from their projects.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  It's quite extraordinary that—what is it now? November 2023?—we're seeing this from the Labor government. If Australians wonder why we are not seeing climate action, here it is. Here it is for people to look at: state capture by the fossil fuel industry. We have a senator, an assistant minister, who genuinely cares. Senator McAllister has a track record on the climate and the environment, and yet here she's having to push this absolute dud bill for the fossil fuel industry. We can't even be told who the environment minister has consulted with in NGOs, in civil society. The only people who want this bill are the fossil fuel industry, and here we're having it put through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition and Labor are supposedly here to take climate change seriously. We hear about how the grown-ups are in charge. We hear so much talk about being 'pragmatic and sensible'. The pragmatic thing to do in the face of the climate impacts we're seeing right now around the world is to not facilitate the expansion of the fossil fuel industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor love to point at crossbenchers, point at the minor parties, point at the Greens and say: 'Well, you're just out of touch. You've got to be a party of government. You've got to be responsible.' Well, don't listen to me. Let's listen to Dr Joelle Gergis, one of Australia's most respected climate scientists, one of the lead authors on the IPCC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sixth assessment report</span>—the last warning before this window that we have to act closes. These are her words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are corporate interests that are willing to sacrifice our planetary life-support system to keep the fossil fuel industry alive for as long as humanly possible, using unproven technology. Carbon capture and storage, known as CCS, is based on the idea that you can extract carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of coal plants or steel factories, compress it, transport it and then inject it back underground, where, in theory, it will remain forever. And that's assuming you can find the right geologic conditions that are stable enough over millennia so that carbon doesn't leak out and back into the atmosphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The problem is not only that the technology is enormously expensive, but that despite over twenty years of research, it is still unproven to work at the scale required to substantially reduce emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute there are 27 operational CCS facilities globally, predominantly in the United States, jointly able to capture 36.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. For context, the world emitted 39.4 billion, with a 'b', tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2021. That is roughly 1,000 times greater than what's possible to capture with current CCS technology. Put another way, CCS plants can only offset around 0.1 per cent of global carbon emissions each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To reach net zero emissions by 2050, scientists calculate that carbon dioxide needs to climb by approximately 1.4 billion tonnes each year. Industry groups estimate that between 655 billion and 1.28 trillion is required to make this a reality. Aside from the trillion-dollar price tag, it's critical to realise that CCS projects take around 10 years to progress through concept, feasibility, design and construction phases before becoming operational—time that we simply don't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Gergis goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Relying on technology that is not ready to be deployed on the scale needed to immediately and drastically address the emergency we face is at best reckless, and at worst an intergenerational crime. It also delays facing the reality that we must stop burning fossil fuels—we need to take serious action and not rely on unproven technology to save the day. As people in climate justice circles like to say, "delay is the new denial." We need to turn the tap off new carbon emissions and start mopping up the damage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, don't take it from me. Is the government, by trying to get this legislation through, being at best reckless and at worst committing an intergenerational crime?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  Thanks, Senator Pocock. I think there is an underlying false choice in the proposition that you have put in your speech. Senator Pocock, since people were being nice about me earlier, I will say also that I recognise that this is an area of sincere interest for you and many other senators in this chamber. It should be, because we are in the critical decade and, if we don't get it right between now and 2030, we'll face some very significant challenges in the decades ahead. It's for that reason that we have come to government with an absolute determination to decarbonise our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The false dichotomy I referred to just now is this one. It is just not right to say that a rapid transition to renewables and the use of CCS are mutually exclusive. I would accept your argument if the policy position of the government was to rely exclusively on CCS, but that's not the policy position of the government. In fact, over the period we have been in office, we have taken a range of steps to reduce our emissions in a range of sectors, using a range of different technologies and tools. It starts with enhancing our near-term ambition and legislating both our 2030 and our 2050 targets. It includes the public investments that we are making in the infrastructure to enable significantly greater renewables in our own electricity system. It includes the steps that we are taking to facilitate electric vehicles and their use in this country and to make Australia an attractive destination for the countries that are producing electric vehicles, including, incidentally, some of the countries with whom we do the greatest trade in energy. It includes the development of a robust framework for the land sector so that the sequestration possibilities that are present in nature based solutions and in biodiversity can be realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is actually not the whole of the government's climate agenda, because it would probably take too long to go through that and it would not really be reasonable to labour the Senate with that. But the point I am making to you is that this is a very challenging period for humanity and it's a challenging period for governments, but we have to tackle it. To do so, we will need every tool at our disposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have placed limits on the largest polluters in our national borders and we have asked them to develop the technological solutions that will help them keep to those limits. It may be that some proponents choose to use CCS as a response to those constraints. If they do so, they should, I think you would agree, do so in a well-regulated environment. That's what this bill seeks to contribute to, along with the other steps that we are taking to strengthen the regulatory arrangements around the CCS projects that may take place in Australian waters. But it has this constraint on it. It needs to stack up commercially for the proponents. They need to make decisions about which technologies are going to work for them as they make their transition towards net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand why senators would like to have the widest possible debate about our path to net zero and the widest possible debate about climate change. But I do draw senators' attention to the actual content of the bill before them. It is a bill that seeks to ratify an international convention that exists to create a standardised approach between countries about how we'll manage a shared ocean resource. As part of that protocol, it seeks to establish the arrangements that will be put in place where there is a transborder movement of carbon dioxide. I personally would prefer the transborder movements of carbon dioxide to be regulated if they are going to occur, and it's on that basis that I do sincerely support the legislation that's before us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank senators for their contributions to date. I don't labour under any delusion that we are about to finish any time soon, but I say this: these things aren't mutually exclusive. Of course we have to pay attention to renewables. Of course we have to work on increasing the uptake and the availability of electric vehicles. Of course we have to work on the land sector. Of course we have to work on the technologies that will support our heaviest industries. While we do it, incidentally, we should pay attention to all of the communities around the country that are absolutely dependent on us getting this transition right so that we can create sustainable, secure jobs that keep people healthy and happy as we head towards 2050. There are heaps of opportunities there, and we're determined to grasp them. The idea that passing this bill will stop any of those other things from happening is simply wrong. </span>

Given your talk about the Albanese government taking climate change seriously and about things that are not mutually exclusive, we know that something that is mutually exclusive is keeping warming below two degrees and expanding the fossil fuel industry. If we're going to listen to the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, those two things cannot both happen. We can expand the fossil fuel industry and we can kiss the Great Barrier Reef—at least 95 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef—goodbye. Faced with those things absolutely being mutually exclusive, I'd also like to say the IPCC says that adaptation beyond two degrees is going to be incredibly difficult, if not bordering on impossible, for many parts of the world. If that is the case, will the government explicitly rule out the use of this sea-dumping legislation being used by new projects to offset their scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and essentially new projects happening under the safeguard mechanism? Will be government rule that out? </span>

What do you say to them? At least the coalition are more honest about it. We have Labor telling us you're taking it seriously and then putting this sort of junk legislation through the Senate with the support of the coalition. How can we take the Labor government seriously, if you want to spruik what you're doing on the transition, but you won't listen to climate scientists when it comes to the need to not expand the fossil fuel industry? </span>

Instead, we're seeing the exact opposite, with the government turning a blind eye as providers struggle to keep their doors open under the new stringent regulations brought in by this government. It's devastating to hear that another 16 aged-care homes have closed since June this year, and that's on top of the 23 closures that we saw from September last year. So the residents of 39 aged-care homes in Australia have been pushed out of their homes in 12 months as a result of the policies of the Albanese Labor government. The department has as much as admitted to this, listing financial viability as the reason for these closures. We know that the decision by this government to bring forward the requirement for 24/7 nurses and other expedited staffing requirements is causing real financial strain on the aged-care sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than 12 months, the coalition and the sector have been warning the government of the consequences of their decisions to force these requirements on the aged-care sector when it is under severe strain from workforce shortages. Let's be clear: in doing what they're doing, Labor has also gone against the recommendations of the royal commission, which recognised that it would take time for these requirements to be put in place. The Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, has consistently refused to listen to these concerns, so now we're seeing more and more older Australians forced out of their homes and no action being taken by this government to address this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these closures, we've also seen 325 fewer beds available for older Australians. This is despite the minister warning 'the Boomers are coming', and yet she's clearly doing nothing about it. So how many more aged-care homes are going to have to shut their doors, because we want aged-care providers to be providing older Australians with care, not worrying about— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I want to acknowledge that this is a really stressful time. Take a breath, remember all the hard work you've put in and just do your best. This is a difficult time, but it is a time when you can look forward to some lengthy downtime once these exams are finished. Good luck to all of you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Labor government, we know that the education you get is really important, and that requires us to make sure that, across the country, we have the best teachers possible to ensure that you get the world-class education you deserve. That's why we've announced that for students who are commencing teaching degrees in 2024 there are now scholarships available for up to $40,000 to encourage more people to become teachers. The scholarships will be available for undergraduate students, and $20,000 will be available for postgraduate students. This scholarship will encourage more teachers to live and work in rural and regional areas. We're hoping to see a lot of people sign up and get on board. Teaching is an excellent profession. The views of the students you teach will stay with you for the rest of your life, and they will remember you and the dedication that you have to their education. So, if you are thinking about a career in education, please sign up for one of the scholarships. And, if you're taking your exams in the next two weeks, the best of best of luck to you.</span>

Seven women—Katherine Safranko, Heather Dean, Krystal Marshall, Thi Thuy Huong Nguyen, Lilie James, Analyn 'Logee' Osias and Alice McShera—were murdered in October by men they knew, bringing the total to 43 women in 2023. These records are not kept by government, as they should be, as we do for the road toll, but kept by a volunteer organisation called Counting Dead Women.</span>

There is a link between elite institutional cultures, male entitlement and violence against women that cannot be ignored. We need to address how power and privilege play into attitudes towards girls and women. We need to stop framing men who kill women as 'good blokes who just snapped'. Men must do far more to stamp out the sexism and misogyny that breeds inequality and violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's transform harmful social norms with fully-funded expert-led education in schools, sporting clubs, workplaces and all areas of society. And let's fully fund the frontline support services that provide emergency housing, legal advice and counselling, so that everyone who seeks help can get it. Governments at all levels must prioritise this issue with funding and leadership, and everyone must drive the cultural change that we need to end the epidemic of men's violence against women in our communities. Today, I remember the 43 women murdered so far in 2023. This has to stop. </span>

I'm not going to name the Labor senator who engaged in the questioning because I'm sure, knowing her or him as I do, that they were given the questions to ask, so these comments are addressed to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. It is inappropriate to ask questions in relation to the former staff of a minister of the nature that was asked today—totally inappropriate. When you ask those sort of questions, which would not be acceptable in any other workplace in this country, you have real-life human consequences on those former staff. It is unacceptable, and it is part of a pattern of behaviour of persecution and harassment of my good friend Senator Reynolds and her former staff from the Labor Party. And the responsibility sits squarely on Prime Minister Albanese, because the senator who asked those questions today would not have been asked to ask those questions unless the Prime Minister knew about it.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Today I want to highlight the immense significance of the 2023 Melbourne Cup carnival, an event that goes far beyond the exhilarating races and extravagant fashion. The race that stops the nation is not just a sporting spectacle; it is a vital engine driving the economy and creating jobs and job opportunities. The Melbourne Cup serves as a powerful magnet to tourists, both domestic and international. Visitors from right around the world are drawn to the Cup and rightly so, filling hotels, restaurants and shops. This surge in tourism not only boosts revenue for local businesses but also provides a substantial injection into the economy. The hospitality sector thrives and small businesses flourish thanks to the influx of visitors seeking an unforgettable experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The carnival is also a significant source of employment. Think about the countless individuals working tirelessly behind the scenes, from event organisers and security personnel to catering staff and cleaning crews. The carnival provides income for many people and supports the livelihoods of individuals who rely on these jobs to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Melbourne Cup is also a testament to Australia's vibrant horseracing industry. The investments made in breeding, training and racing of thoroughbred horses contribute significantly to the agriculture sector and regional communities, fostering economic stability and growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cup also fosters a sense of community pride and engagement. Many local communities come together to celebrate this iconic event, organising festivals, parades and cultural activities. Let us celebrate not just the excitement of the race but also the economic opportunities and jobs it brings to our communities, particularly regional communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  The Prime Minister is back from China. Apparently, there were warm handshakes all around, but the PM is saying that the meeting wasn't transactional, which I guess means that we didn't promise anything and nothing was promised—good to know, because, even if the Chinese Communist Party make promises, they can break those promises the very next day. That's how a dictatorship works. This isn't news to Chinese Australians; they know how the Chinese Communist Party works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am worried about is the deals that have already been made in this country. The Chinese already own 7.8 million hectares of Australian farmland, and the Foreign Investment Review Board gave the tick to $700 million of residential real estate proposals just in the first three months of this year. Tasmanians know this story very well—don't you, Tasmanians?—because in 2014 the Liberal Premier, Will Hodgman, showed the Chinese President around Tasmania, and the story goes that the Chinese said they wanted to buy TasPorts. Apparently, the Premier said he 'couldn't quite make that work'. Well, thank God! Instead, he directed the Chinese government reps to a nice bit of crown land on the waterfront in Hobart. Then, in 2015, without any consultation with the community, the Premier put out a press release that this prime land would be gifted to a Chinese company to build a massive hotel and hospitality centre. The local council, headed up by the mayor, who was a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party, waved the deal through. Fast-forward to 2023, and it seems that this deal is dead in the water, thanks mainly to the local community. Thanks to the community down there. Well done, you guys. I am not saying I'm against overseas investment—we need it—but it is Australians who should be first in line when it comes to owning our land and assets, like ports, and we should not be selling anything off to other countries, especially China. They aren't a democracy, and they don't follow a rules based order.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Recently, I had the privilege to visit the newly upgraded Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay with the member for Dawson, Mr Andrew Willcox. The former coalition government invested $10 million to upgrade the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay, and it looks absolutely fantastic, befitting one of the most beautiful parts of our world. The arena has recently hosted two first-class cricket games—both women's and men's. They've been broadcast live, and they had absolutely stellar reports from Cricket Australia. Indeed, Cricket Australia now say that the Great Barrier Reef Arena is the best cricket ground in any regional part of our country or any non-capital city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it can do more. It can do much, much more, because we've got this thing called the Brisbane Olympics coming over the next decade. Of course, befitting its name, most of the money—about $7 billion—is going towards Brisbane. Part of that money will be to upgrade the Gabba cricket stadium, and, because of those upgrades, we will need a new venue for a test cricket match for about four or five seasons over the next decade. There are some saying we should build a whole new stadium in Brisbane to accommodate this other cricket match, which to me seems to be a massive missed opportunity. It would create another white elephant, because what will happen once the Gabba is redeveloped is that those cricket games will just go back to the Gabba, of course. Why not take this opportunity to take test cricket to the regions—to Mackay? What better selling point for our great tourism industry could there be than to have test cricket at the Great Barrier Reef Arena? The Barmy Army can come over, see their team lose and then head out to the Whitsundays afterwards for a wonderful trip to drown their sorrows. It's a great part of our country, it's a great arena, and I thank Adrian Young and his whole team at Harrup Park Country Club for what they've done.</span>

I'm very pleased to see that Arthritis Australia has been working on resources to put in place a juvenile idiopathic arthritis consumer care guide.

It includes useful information about every stage of the disease, what to expect, tips for every age and extra resources for more information and support because we want to see people with arthritis, especially young people, supported to improve their health and wellbeing, which can, with the right care, resources and medical innovation, see people's outcomes and children's outcomes dramatically improve. The key to this is, of course, making informed decisions throughout your care journey. For some families, the time line of this referral to diagnosis and treatment has been way too long, and so I am really pleased to see the hardworking team at Arthritis Australia work with these families to make great strides in advocating for greater support for these children with this debilitating— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  On 18 October, as the State of Israel was raining bombs down on Gaza, as civilians perished and hospitals lay in ruins, the Labor and Liberal parties passed a motion through this place that said the Senate stands with Israel. The Australian Greens did not support that motion precisely because those words were included, and now, three weeks later, over 10,000 Palestinian civilians have died in Gaza. Countless more have been injured. Babies and children are dying every day. Fuel and electricity have been cut off. Thirst, starvation and displacement are part of the daily lives of millions of people. Large parts of Gaza have been turned into rubble. It is profoundly distressing, a humanitarian catastrophe of the highest order, so I say to the Labor and Liberal parties: do you still stand with Israel? Because from everything you have done and said and everything you have not done and not said, it appears that you do. I ask you this: how many people need to die while you still stand with Israel? How many babies need to be slaughtered while you still stand with Israel? How many children need to be buried alive while you still stand with Israel? The time for standing with Israel has passed. The time for a ceasefire is now. Stop the slaughter in Gaza—ceasefire now! <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Almost a fortnight ago, I sat down with a roomful of Canberra's heroes—frontline service providers here in the ACT delivering desperately needed services to some of the most vulnerable in our community. For an hour and a half, we heard from more than two dozen people in the room, as everyone took turns reporting back on what they were seeing on the front line. Called 'Who's new on the streets', these bimonthly meetings are an important check-in and a way of coordinating scarce resources to meet growing demand. While everyone brings a unique perspective, some all too common themes emerged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single representative reported an increase in the incidence of family and domestic violence. Every single representative said there was nowhere left to send those fleeing violence and seeking a safe place to stay. Wait times for public housing are around four years, even for those with the most urgent need. Places in transitional housing are full, and funding for crisis accommodation has run out. I heard from staff at the Canberra Hospital that they are seeking to keep women in hospital—to keep women on the ward—longer than medically necessary because they have nowhere safe to discharge them to. Here in one of the most affluent places in the country, we can't afford to put someone up for a night or two in emergency motel accommodation. The best hospital staff can offer women, children and others fleeing family and domestic violence is a couple of nights in the charity volunteer operated sleepbus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to do more, and I'm calling on the government to step in with additional funding for emergency services and accommodation. This is a joint responsibility of state, territory and federal governments, and we have to keep people in our community safe.</span>

Sophia spent a week during the last sitting period as a work experience student in my office and, due to circumstances beyond my control, I wasn't able to make this speech while she was here. It has been a pleasure to witness a young person with such a passion for politics. I am reading this speech sight unseen. They are her words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Four lessons politics has taught me about the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, the environment around us is everchanging. Therefore, it is imperative that we are guided by our core values. Our own personal ethical code must underscore every decision we make as individuals. Nowhere is this more apparent than in this senate chamber, where I have observed hours of deliberation over a single word in a proposed bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, as once encapsulated by Albert Einstein, possessing passionate curiosity is paramount. Curiosity is a stepping stone for all political progress, and without curiosity, it is impossible to learn, collaborate and enact change. My own personal curiosity over the past 4 days has allowed me to expand my understanding of the democratic process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Thirdly, we must seek and encourage diversity of opinion. As a young person living in 2023, I find it distressing that my identity is often placed on a higher pedestal than my ideas. We must not live in an echo chamber. In order for growth and change, we must surround ourselves with unlike-minded people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, I have learnt that it is extremely difficult to write a 2-minute speech when I have so much more to say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Sophia, for being with us. I am sure you will have much more to say over your life, and I hope one day you are here to deliver your own words.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I rise to urge the Albanese Labor government to get a move on with reining in the out-of-control National Disability Insurance Scheme. Since announcing a reboot of the NDIS, this government has done little to nothing to rein in the exploding cost of the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the NDIS in principle. It was sold to me on the basis that parents of disabled Australians would have assurance that their children would be cared for when they could no longer do it themselves. I was never told it would be used to fund kids with ADHD, which, let's face it, is sometimes a convenient diagnosis excusing poor parenting. I was never told it was going to be used to pay sex workers or fund music lessons as part of care plans costing more than $600,000 per year. And what about corporate box football tickets at $42,000 or alcohol and Christmas presents? It's all absolutely disgusting!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could start by reining in rates of pay for specialists, which are up to three times those for specialists in other sectors like public health and aged care. These sectors are struggling to retain skilled workers and are struggling with staff shortages, whereas the NDIS snaps workers up at unsustainable rates. Across the forward estimates, the NDIS is anticipated to cost taxpayers more than $56 billion a year. It is not means tested, and that's a big problem that we have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of putting at risk more than $10 billion of vital infrastructure funding in Queensland, especially urgent safety upgrades to the notorious Bruce Highway, the government needs to prioritise a reboot of the NDIS. Don't cut important infrastructure. Rein in the scams and waste within the NDIS. As I explained, we've even got someone on the scheme on up to $300,000 who is taking cooking lessons. They get a chef to come out and give them cooking lessons. They get holidays away. These are things that the average Australian can't afford, and we're paying for it. It's a scam.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Broken wheelchairs, the ignoring of instructions and disabled people being bumped off flights—the list of injustices suffered by disabled people at the hands of Australia's airlines goes on and on. Let me share with you a recent incident. A disabled man was tipped out of his wheelchair by Virgin Australia ground crew while attempting to board a flight. He was accompanied by two carers, whose instructions were reportedly ignored by crew members. This experience is not unique. It represents the hard reality for disabled people. In this instance, we saw the incredible harm done to this individual. In another incident, the same thing happened to Dr Dinesh Palipana, a former Queensland Australian of the Year who was flying from Brisbane to Melbourne to give a talk on disability inclusion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not isolated incidents.  In my role as a senator, I have had vital pieces of my chair either lost or broken by Australia's airlines on no fewer than three occasions, and I don't mind sharing with the Senate that this has then caused me to fall multiple times in my home and in public. I've also been kicked off flights when airlines have found out that I am a disabled person. This is discrimination, and it happens to disabled people all the time when we fly. I could share with you countless stories. The experiences are not just unacceptable; they are downright infuriating. It is 2023, yet disablism persists. We refuse to accept this as disabled people. There must be change, and the government must lead that change. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  It's Melbourne Cup day today, and normally most Australians would be looking forward to three o'clock—having a bit of a punt, a chicken sandwich and a glass of bubbles as they await the race that stops the nation. Instead, more and more Australian families and households are going to be awaiting the announcement of the Reserve Bank. This will determine those families' future in so many instances, because we know that, since we have seen the Albanese government come to power, there has been an explosion of working poor in this country. As food costs, energy costs, transport costs and insurance costs rise, Australian families—many of them with two working parents—for the first time in their lives are having to ask for assistance from food banks to keep food on the table.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening under the watch of those opposite,  yet we see absolute ignorance from them when it comes to the economy. They have no concept. In fact, they can barely contain themselves from telling Australians they've never had it so good since the government came in because of everything they're doing. But every decision they make affects more and more working Australians, creating a class of working poor in this country. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. How you could go back to any of the states that you represent and look at those families who'll be making phone calls to their banks come next week to look at interest-only payments, reducing payments and payment schedules! Forget about the ones who've got to the point where they've lost all their savings, there is no buffer anymore and it's a matter of choosing between keeping the house or paying the rent and feeding the children—all under your watch.</span>

Stabilising our relationship with China is vitally important for Australia and important for Australian exporting businesses and workers. After all, China is our largest trading partner. Yesterday the Prime Minister met with China's President Xi in Beijing to continue stabilising our relationship and continue advocating for removal of the outstanding trade impediments affecting high-quality Australian products. How are the government's efforts to stabilise our trade relationship with China delivering practical outcomes for Australian exporters, producers and workers?</span>

I thank Senator Stewart for her question. I know just how important trade is to the great state of Victoria. Yesterday we witnessed a historic moment in our bilateral relationship with China when Prime Minister Albanese met with President Xi. This visit to China marked the 50th anniversary of Gough Whitlam's first visit to China. Positive, constructive dialogue is a win-win for both our economies. It delivers practical benefits for Australian exporters, businesses and workers. By having a more stable relationship with China, we've seen the return of so many wonderful Australian products to a market of 1.4 billion consumers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we've faced an incredible $20 billion worth of trade impediments on Australian exporters, but in the last 18 months we have made enormous progress. Between January and August of this year, Australia exported to China $6 billion worth of products that were previously subject to trade impediments. That is $6 billion worth of high-quality Australian product that has now re-entered Chinese markets due to the stabilisation efforts of our government.</span>

Of course, we've had record first-term-of-government growth in jobs, almost the equivalent of six MCG stadiums. Australia is economically stronger when global trade flows freely. We know that one in four Australian jobs relate to trade, and jobs in export industries pay five per cent higher wages on average. In addition, we know that trade creates a competitive environment, lowering prices and helping reduce the costs of living for everyday Australians, which is why we've worked so hard in the last year to deliver opportunities that advance our trade agenda by implementing trade agreements with India and the United Kingdom—something that the previous government, of course, couldn't do. This government is ensuring that trade— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I said, if the Nationals want to understand why this government has to do something to rescue the Murray-Darling Basin then they only need to look back at their track record over the 10 years that they were in power. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan that the former government was allegedly committed to required the recovery of 450 gigalitres of water for the environment.

The former water minister, Tony Burke, also said, in 20 February 2012, 'We don't do the environment, or anyone, a favour if we acquire volumes of water and have the impact that may have on communities, and then discover it can't actually be used.' Why is the government refusing to release details around which constraints programs it believes are needed to ensure environmental outcomes can be achieved?</span>

Minister Burke was a very fine agriculture minister. He was also a very fine environment and water minister, who oversaw the delivery of the first Murray-Darling Basin Plan—a plan that is absolutely essential to deliver if we are to save agriculture on the eastern coast of our country. There are thousands of jobs and hundreds of communities that are depending upon the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They were profoundly let down by 10 years of Liberal and National Party governments, which delivered two gigalitres out of the 450 required for environmental recovery.</span>

Basin Communities Committee Indigenous member, Mr Feli McHughes, stated recently, 'I'm very concerned that buybacks will further spiral our people in these communities into poverty'. When will the government listen to basin communities and voices like Mr McHughes's, and look at alternatives being proposed, like billabong restoration and complementary measures?</span>

Senator Davey has just exemplified the National Party's approach to this entire issue, which is to misrepresent the government's position in inquiries, in the media and to basin communities. We have made very clear over and over again that we do think that voluntary water buybacks are going to be necessary to save the Murray-Darling Basin, and they weren't required and weren't delivered under the former government. </span>

                  </a>  Well, if Senator Davey had allowed me to answer the question, what I was saying is that we have said that it is going to be necessary to undertake voluntary water buybacks to deliver the plan. But we have also repeatedly said that it is not the only option that we are considering. We are considering water efficiency infrastructure projects, but Senator Davey and people like her go around basin communities misrepresenting the government's policy and pretending it's only about buybacks. We have also said that all buybacks will be voluntary. We have also said that they will be done across the basin in order to minimise the impact on any one particular community. And we have also said that, where they do have a negative impact on communities, there will be structural adjustment assistance provided. It would be good if the National Party were honest for a change. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You are aware of that because I know that this was covered in some detail at Senate estimates when you were asking questions about this very matter, so you do know that we can't do that. What you also know is that Australia's defence exports are conducted in line with robust export guidelines and international obligations. The Department of Defence assesses each export application on its own merits against the relevant legislative criteria under the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012. This legislation addresses a range of issues, including those that you have raised. Those issues include foreign policy, human rights, national security and Australia's international obligations. If Defence identifies an export would be contrary to Australia's national interest or pose risks to Australia's security, defence or international relations, the permit is refused. </span>

I will be clear about this: the government appreciates this is a complex and sensitive area of public policy that must account for security interests, human rights obligations and the viability of domestic industry. </span>

But, as was also pointed out to you, Senator Shoebridge, at Senate estimates, when we're talking about defence exports we're not just talking about weapons and we're not just talking about arms. We're also talking about what is known as dual-use technology, things like radios or other technology and communications equipment, so you shouldn't assume that the existence of a permit means that a weapon has been exported to any country, whether that be Israel or any other. But, for very good reason, we don't go around broadcasting details of export permits that we have with any particular country, because there are national security issues at stake, and this is a government that takes national security seriously.</span>

Again, you wouldn't expect me, especially as a representing minister, to be making Australian government policy in Senate question time. But the broad position that we take—as I say, we're not broadcasting individual details—is that, as I have already answered, the matters around human rights and the usage of defence exports, whether they be weapons or other forms of technology, are taken into account in the granting of a particular permit or the extension of permits in the future. So these are exactly the types of issues that are taken into account by the Department of Defence in reaching decisions about whether they would grant a particular export permit.</span>

I can confirm that new analysis shows that Australian households are saving from 39 to 57 per cent on their energy bills when they have rooftop solar installed.

                  </a>  It seems that the opposition hates the idea of Australians saving money on their energy bills. But, by installing those rooftop solar panels, Australians are generating savings of between $822 and $1,350 per household on power bills, and that makes a significant difference to the hip pockets of Australian families. That's because, as this side of the chamber knows—and we have many examples right now before us of what that side of the chamber doesn't know—renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy. One in three Australian homes now have a solar installation, and the total small-scale solar capacity of Australia's 3.5 million household installations exceeds 21 gigawatts. That's the equivalent of 10 to 15 large coal-fired power stations. I am proud to say, Senator Rennick, that some of the biggest benefits are in Queensland. In South-East Queensland households with solar save 44 per cent on their bills, and in regional Queensland, Senator Canavan, households are saving 57 per cent on their bills. The Australian Energy Market Operator's latest report shows that the 31 per cent growth in rooftop solar output helped drive a 71 per cent reduction in wholesale prices in a year by reducing demand on the grid and reducing the use of more expensive sources of fuel during the day. That's why the Albanese government is ensuring wider access to cleaner, cheaper solar.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Grogan is right: the Nationals leader, Mr Littleproud, did call for a pause on renewables. At a time when Australians are dealing with cost-of-living pressures, the Nationals want to pause the price reductions Aussies are getting through renewables. We're getting on with the job of rolling out renewables. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Thank you for confirming that, Senator Rennick. Unlike the opposition, the Albanese government's No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and cost-of-living pressures. That's why we are delivering targeted relief without adding to inflation. We're delivering energy price relief rebates to more than five million households and one million small businesses, to provide hundreds of dollars off bills. These will benefit eligible households by up to $500 and small businesses by up to $650 in total per year and are credited to power bills throughout the year. For households receiving rebates, bill increases in most jurisdictions have been completely offset and have decreased by up to 18 per cent for the most vulnerable Australians.</span>

And this highlights the significant impact that the Albanese government's coal and gas price caps are having on Australian power bills. We know that the job is not yet done when it comes to assisting with cost-of-living relief, but we've introduced a range of measures like this to add weight and assist Australians. But, for these caps that we introduced and we voted for, guess how the coalition voted? They voted no. When we voted to cap coal and gas prices, the coalition said no. And, of course, before he went off on his most recent world tour, Mr Dutton—they don't like being reminded, but we're going to keep reminding people—told an energy conference, 'Just like Reagan, we will wind back government intervention.' Now, what sort of intervention is Mr Dutton going to wind back? Is it coal and gas prices, or is it energy rebates? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </span>The American legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, provides that, starting at 40 per cent and then moving to 80 per cent, all of the critical minerals that are going to go into the batteries of electric cars in the United States have to come from countries that have two criteria. Firstly, they have the resources and, of course, once again Australia is the lucky country because we have either the largest or the second-largest deposit of all of the critical minerals that are going to go into the batteries of the future. Secondly, they have to have a free trade agreement with the United States. Australia is one of very few countries which have both of those criteria. What that means is a huge amount of investment, not just from the United States but also from Japan, Korea, Singapore—if we get lucky—maybe even the Europeans. So you can talk down the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition to that, what has California done? Well, California has mandated that by 20— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Look, we are developing a response to the Inflation Reduction Act. I have tried to put into perspective the positive aspects of that piece of legislation. I didn't go into the negative aspects of that legislation and they relate to other forms of energy, such as hydrogen. One of the discussions that we're having with the United States at the moment is ensuring that the price that they sell their hydrogen at doesn't undercut any production of hydrogen. Of course, all of the states right now are looking at the way in which they can get into that hydrogen cycle. I know from South Australia's point of view just how much work and effort are going into the development at Port Bonython. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This government intends to build Australia as a renewable superpower. All of the things we're doing, whether it's the National Reconstruction Fund, whether it's trying to encourage investment from overseas in our resources because we have always required that sort of investment— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A recent statement by the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, stated that the Australian government 'should implement public investment projects at a more measured and coordinated' pace'—for example, infrastructure—'to alleviate inflationary pressures'. Now, I'm not usually one to support bodies like the IMF, but the government—both sides of this chamber—loves to bend the knee to unelected globalist bodies. It just so happens that, this time, I agree with them and they're speaking my language! To play your role in tempering inflation, what wasteful projects will your government potentially cancel or maybe delay?</span>

Of course, I start by going back in time a little bit to indicate just the sort of mess that the coalition left us in. After 10 years of announcement upon announcement upon announcement but then no delivery, we are now delivering on an infrastructure program that is fit for purpose—and I stress the term 'fit for purpose'—fiscally responsible but, above all, deliverable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as you say, we commissioned an independent review to ensure our infrastructure program is deliverable and does not place added pressure on inflation and the cost of living, two issues that I know you're concerned about. This review was necessary because the former government was all about announcement and no delivery. Projects were left without adequate funding or resources, and projects without real benefits to the public were approved. No doubt the National Party was mixed up in all of those sorts of decisions. Minister King said the review has found more than $33 billion in cost overruns across the infrastructure investment program, with a high likelihood of future, as-yet-unknown cost increases. Minister King is working closely with the states and territories to determine the outcome of the review. The former government announced projects without checking if they were priorities of the state first—no surprises in that—and this resulted in those projects being stalled for years or, worse, costs blowing out. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're talking now about wasteful projects and talking about the previous government. Fair enough. Let's speak about that for a second. Let's speak about Snowy 2.0. Snowy 2.0 is a wasteful project; we all know that. It was the Liberals' idea; it wasn't even your idea. It went to $2 billion and then to $5.9 billion, and now we're looking at $12 billion. The boring machine—the one that digs all the tunnels and things like that—has been bogged for about a year. It got stuck. What are you going to do to fill that hole? Are you going to cut your losses and give up? How about nuclear instead? How about that? Let's give up on Snowy 2.0.</span>

No, we're not going to give up. This is not a government that gives up. I understand what you're saying about the cost overruns for Snowy 2.0, but the reality is that, if we're going to move to that renewable future—to the status, as I described in a previous answer today, of renewables superpower—we do need Snowy 2.0 to work. Despite the underresourcing by the former government and despite all the promises, we will be the government that delivers on that. It's important from this point of view—I'm sorry to keep harping on South Australia, but I happen to know a lot about it— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Now, projects like Snowy 2.0 take skilled tradespeople away from the residential construction sector at a time when we're facing a housing shortage. Do you agree that wasteful infrastructure projects like Snowy 2.0 are contributing to our skilled labour shortage? If they are, shouldn't we at least pause them for a little while, at least temporarily, to help people struggling with housing? Might that not be a good idea? A better idea is to go for nuclear instead, but anyway!</span>

You're very focused on nuclear there, I notice. Just finishing what I was going to say in my previous answer: we have surplus solar energy in South Australia during the day. That can be used to pump water up to the top of the Snowy and to produce energy at night, when we don't have solar.</span>

It would be irresponsible to move ahead without fixing the backlog and cleaning up the mess that the former government left behind, and that's why Minister King has commissioned an independent review of the Infrastructure Investment Program.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government, in managing its budget, have to make responsible offers when we're undertaking enterprise bargaining or any other form of negotiation with people who are paid by the Commonwealth government. There's a wide range of sectors within the Public Service that are currently in enterprise bargaining negotiations. We always try to put forward what we consider to be a fair offer as a government that does believe in wages being lifted, but we obviously also have to operate within a budget and try to make sure that those are responsible offers that we put forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, Senator Lambie, that, in addition to the basic pay rates that you're talking about, you've got an interest in issues around recruitment and retention of Defence personnel. You'd be aware that our government have announced a retention bonus for ADF personnel, which would see them receive a $50,000 retention bonus toward the end of their initial period of service if they commit to remain in the ADF for a further three years. That's going to be an initial two-year pilot before being extended based on its results. I recognise that that's not exactly what you're talking about in terms of the basic pay rates to our troops, but we are trying to find ways of delivering fair remuneration for troops in recognition of the service that they provide and the danger that they put themselves in each and every day. So this is something that we'll keep working on, but, as I say, we do need to undertake all of these pay rises within an overall responsible budget strategy.</span>

I think, in one respect, you've put forward exactly why unions play such an important role in the workplace by being able to bring employees together to negotiate on behalf of everyone to seek a better deal. Of course, as a former service woman you would be aware that there aren't unions covering service people. I guess that means that they don't benefit from the union arrangements that are in place for other members who work for the Department of Defence. But one thing I would like to mention is that beyond the basic pay rates and pay rises that are awarded or provided to ADF personnel, of course ADF members' remuneration has also increased through additional factors such as allowances. Salary and allowance increases have been delivered through a combination of an increase through a new salary related allowance framework and a new workplace remuneration arrangement. I am happy to provide you with details of that if that would be of interest. </span>

In fact, this government has done more than most when it comes to providing cost-of-living relief for all Australians, whether they be service personnel or any other working person in the community. You're aware of some of the things we have done that benefit service personnel just as much as they do any other worker, whether it be cheaper medicines or cheaper child care, and in some cases people would be eligible for energy rebates and a range of other measures as well. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware the independent Reserve Bank board has today raised interest rates by 25 basis points, and we know that that decision will hit Australians hard. What we are doing about it is providing as much cost-of-living relief as we possibly can while recording a budget surplus—something that the coalition government were unable to do for the entire 10 years that they were in government—to take pressure off inflation and pressure off interest rates. We understand that this will be hitting a lot of Australians hard, and we will keep working hard to provide as much cost-of- living relief as we can. For a change, it would be nice to have the opposition's support. </span>

Bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare, and Labor will always strengthen it. The May budget provided an historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare to lay the foundations for significant reforms to general practice and primary care for all Australians. We have boosted indexation of Medicare payments, with boosts in July and November delivering the largest increase to Medicare payments since Paul Keating was prime minister. In fact, the Albanese government has delivered a larger increase in one year than the former government delivered over seven years. From 1 November the incentives that general practitioners receive to bulk-bill children under 16, pensioners and other Commonwealth concession cardholders will be tripled for most common GP consults.

Strengthening Medicare provides us with a foundation to rebuild primary health care after a decade of neglect and cuts. This won't happen overnight, but we've begun the task of delivering the improvements that are so badly needed. We've introduced a new Medicare rebate for GP consultations of 60 minutes or longer, giving patients a rebate of $191.20 and doctors the time to provide better care for people with complex conditions. We are making vital medicines cheaper to millions of Australians, and South Australians are saving $12 million since 1 January this year. And we have opened 36 Medicare urgent care clinics around the country, including five across South Australia, with Marion and Elizabeth clinics now up and running. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Of course, the independent Reserve Bank board has today raised interest rates, regrettably, by 25 basis points, taking the official cash rate to 4.35 per cent. Of course, we understand that today's decision will hit Australians hard. The price pressures that we face are coming at us from around the world, but they're hitting the hip pockets of ordinary Australians the hardest. That's why our highest priority is rolling out the $23 billion in cost-of-living relief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw at the end of question time that the acting Leader of the Government in the Senate—and I think we're all going to be very relieved when Senator Wong returns—was completely unable to give Australians any reassurance that this Labor government has a clue about how to deal with the inflation and cost-of-living crisis that is facing families, small businesses and medium-sized businesses right across Australia. In fact, the modus operandi of those opposite seems to be that a lie told often enough becomes the truth. This is a quote attributed to Vladimir Lenin—perhaps not surprisingly, someone from the Left—but it actually predates Vladimir Lenin. But there is a truth to it in relation to the way that this government is operating. They want to blame the previous government for interest rate rises, all of which—bar one—have been under their watch. They've delivered two budgets since gaining office, and it is their economic settings that the RBA look at when they decide whether or not to raise interest rates. We've seen this pattern a couple of times now. The RBA paused interest rate rises before the government handed down the last budget. The RBA said, 'We're going to pause, wait, look at the government's budget and decide what to do.' They waited a month and then they raised interest rates. Then they paused again, waited, and watched this government and what they were doing in relation to their own balance sheet to address the inflationary issues in our economy. And the RBA has raised interest rates again today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That hits Australian families hard and that hits small businesses extraordinarily hard. They're facing cost pressures from so many directions. It's not just from the interest rate rises on their borrowings—whether that be a mortgage or a small business loan—but also from cost-of-living pressures from their suppliers and when they're going down to the shops, buying the groceries, filling up their car at the petrol station and paying their electricity bills. A lie told often enough can turn into the truth. The Labor Party keeps saying electricity prices are coming down; it's simply not true—</span>

Clearly those opposite—in this chamber and as a government—are terribly sensitive about their approach to public policy if they can't even stand mild criticism. They continuously trot out this claim that electricity prices are falling, when every single Australian knows when they receive their electricity bill that those prices are going up and up and up. Not one Australian has seen a reduction in their energy bills off the back of anything this government has done.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just go through some of the numbers we've seen in the last 15 months under the Labor Party. The cost of food is up 8.2 per cent, the cost of housing is up 10.4 per cent, the cost of insurance is up 17.3 per cent, the cost of electricity is up 18.2 per cent and the cost of gas is up 28 per cent. Yet those opposite have the gall to criticise us for voting against their terrible policy in relation to electricity and their awful policy in terms of gas. These policies are adding to the inflationary pressures in the economy, not taking inflationary pressures out of the economy. This Labor government have no clue how to deal with inflation. Their budgets pushed more money into the economy. A number of senior economists have said that Labor budgets were pushing inflationary pressures into the economy. Today, with this interest rate rise, we see the result of Labor's policies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  In response to those take notes: we've got a situation here where these are the people who, when we came into government, had left a trillion dollars in future debt. These are the people who have turned around and come in here to lecture us about what needs to be done in the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know people are doing it tough; they're doing it tough because of the policies of those opposite. And they're doing it tough for lots of other reasons. We have implemented $23 billion worth of cost-of-living support across this economy and for people right across this country. And what have the opposition done? When we put up investing in energy bills relief, the Liberals and Nationals voted against it. We put in cost-of-living relief for energy, and they voted against it. What did they do when it came to cheaper medicines? People are struggling in our communities, trying to deal with the cost of living and what did those opposite do? They voted against that relief. That's what they're about: a trillion dollars of debt and voting against cost-of-living relief. When it came to cheaper child care, what did they do? Surprise, surprise! They voted against that as well. That's because they cannot see an opportunity to turn around and support the Australian public. When there are the hard times that people are facing at the moment, what do they do? They just want to make them harder!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We call for relief and we put policies forward to make sure there's relief and opportunity to turn around and actually have the economy be more productive—to get family members out there to work by having cheaper child care. What did they do? They voted against it. We do sensible relief and they vote against it. We do financial relief and they vote against it. We can look at increased rent assistance and boosting income support payments, which the Liberals and Nationals were against too. How many things can they be against?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, there actually are more! They were against affordable homes—they were against affordable homes in this country, in these tough times! They couldn't even get that right! They're against every measure to make it easier for the Australian public in these tough times. They gave us a trillion dollars in debt and then they voted against cost-of-living relief and things that could make this economy more supportive to the rest of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, don't worry: we invested in things that make the cost of living cheaper for people who are doing TAFE. That's because we want to organise people to have more opportunity, including not only those who are socially disadvantaged but others in our community across the regions, states and urban areas of our country through hundreds of thousands of fee-free TAFE places. You might think, 'That's a logical thing; they'd vote for that one, wouldn't they?' They voted against that as well! We're trying to get productivity boosts in this economy, with the opportunities for more jobs, more training and more skills to make sure that Australians have those opportunities, and they voted against them. It's cost-of-living relief and also a productivity boost, and they voted against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can start looking at some of these things they voted against and some of their comments. I think the fee-free TAFE is just a real bobby-dazzler. When we think of that one, there are some of the comments made by the shadow minister for skills and training, the deputy opposition leader. Her view was that paying for fee-free TAFE, or having it in the first place, was a waste of money. They voted against it; they ridiculed people doing TAFE. They ridiculed all those people out there, all those apprentices, who have turned around and are making sure that we have a better and well-trained community with the opportunities out there. They voted against it and they spoke against it. They demeaned it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we can look at some of the comments made by others about cost-of-living pressures when it comes to wages—every wage initiative we have taken. There was the minimum wage and extra payments for aged-care workers, which had been recommended by the royal commission. Those were things which meant that our loved ones actually have the care they need and that the 250,000 workers in that largely feminised industry have a more decent rate of pay. And what did they do? They voted against it! Minimum wage increases: they voted against them! At every opportunity to have companies and workers work together for better wages and more productivity, involving employer bargaining, they voted against it. It's because they just don't like the idea that people stand together and look after each other. That's what you do when things are tough; you don't sit on your hands and do nothing!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  On a day when interest rates have hit 4.35 per cent, and after 12 interest rate rises under this government, Australians are going to be doing it very hard if they have a mortgage. At least a third of the Australian public are going to be under great pressure. There are definitely going to be Australians that are going to look at this and say, 'That won't affect me directly,' but at least a third of the populace have got a mortgage. By representing a state like New South Wales with a large city like Sydney within it, I know that there are many people across Sydney that have very large mortgages, and they will be looking at this result today, of the interest rates going up, and thinking: 'How am I going to make this all work? How am I going to make it stack up for my own personal circumstances?' The consequence here is that people will in some ways have to economise. In other ways, they will have to have a conversation with their bank. Some people will not be able to continue, and they will lose their homes. And that is the great tragedy of this outcome today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being in the position of having 12 rate rises in a row is a direct result, a direct consequence, of the government's fiscal policy. We had Senate estimates last week, and I asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank whether the government was running a contractionary fiscal policy. The governor told me that fiscal policy was neutral. So it's not contractionary. So here you are with the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates 12 times under the Labor government, and that same governor, Ms Bullock, is telling the government, 'Cut spending. Help us.' We want the government to run a contractionary fiscal policy because that is the best thing the government can do to reduce pressure on the Reserve Bank, which is now smashing mortgage holders. So, indirectly, the government is making it so much harder for mortgage holders across Australia to keep their homes and to do what they want to do with their own money. This is a hugely regrettable day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, though, the Australian people have two major problems with this particular economic strategy the government has deployed. The first is that it is a government for vested interests. The only policies this government is interested in are policies which enrich the unions and the major super funds. That is the policy of the government: vested interests. The unions and the big super funds run this country with Labor in office. The only policies you want to see in this chamber are things the unions and super funds want. Pattern bargaining, the abolition of labour hire, more and more money for their mates in the super funds—the whole government is run for vested interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue is that when you only have time to look after your best mates—the people who run your pre-selections, fund your campaigns and do everything for you on polling day—you have no time to look after the major issues facing the Australian people. I hate to break it to the government, but the major issue facing most people under 40 in this country is housing. What's happened today with the interest rate going up has made it so much harder for people to stay in a house and even harder for young people to get into a first home. The government says it doesn't care about people and their housing needs. They brush their hands and they laugh off this new interest rate rise today. After 12 interest rate rises under this government, which are going to make a bad situation with housing so much worse, particularly in Sydney, the government can just laugh and sneer, as we saw in question time and now here in the Senate chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disappointing thing here is that the government could be doing a lot to help mortgage holders. But they have chosen to run, as the Reserve Bank governor herself has said, a neutral fiscal policy, when they should be running a contractionary fiscal policy to help the Reserve Bank do its job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I relish the opportunity to make a contribution on this important day, because I really do care about the third of Australians who are going to find it difficult to stay in their homes. But I'm disappointed by the nature and the quality of the questions and the attitude that we've seen. It's almost gleeful delight from those in opposition that this is a tough time for Australians, because they can manufacture that into some sort of political campaign. In the meantime, we are the government that has to act responsibly and in the national interest, and responsibly managing the budget is a vital task. That's why I'm proud to be a Labor senator alongside the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who after all the promises of the previous government delivered the first surplus Australia's seen in decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Economic responsibility is a signature of a good government, and we have to do the very best we can for Australians. That is why we've got two things we have to do. One of them is certainly to really watch what's happening in terms of inflation. But it's not the government that determines when a rate should rise, when the Reserve Bank raises or lowers rates. It is the Reserve Bank that does it independent of government. The reason that's done is the wisdom of establishing that separation. Of course as a government you don't want to see people suffer. You don't want to see that suffering and that hurt. We want to do everything we can to support people. But the reality is that, just as COVID was an international phenomenon, so is inflation. It is like a disease in the economy, and we don't live in an economy that sits outside the world. We are part of the world. With the increase in the rates that did come through today, we are responding to that as a nation at the direction of the RBA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New Zealand their current policy rate is 5.5 per cent. They've raised their rates by 525 basis points—5.25 per cent. Ours is now 4.35. Listen to the comparators. In the US they've raised it by 5.25. In Canada they've raised it by 4.75 per cent. The European Central Bank raised it by 4.5 per cent, and in England they raised it by 5.15 per cent. No-one, no government, wants to see inflation rise. No government can afford to allow it to fester. We have to use the tools that we have, and the responsible direction of the RBA is critical to what we do. But, while we are suffering that pain as a nation together—every single one of us who has a mortgage or loves somebody who does, making up one-third of the nation—a responsible government does things to assist those who are struggling. That's why $23 billion is being invested, against the wishes of those opposite who asked the questions today, to help Australians get through this tough time. That's what Labor governments do. We won't leave people hanging, lingering in financial suffering. That is why, even though those opposite didn't want it, there's electricity bill relief for five million Australians. Those opposite would have left them hanging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is cheaper child care. Ninety per cent of Australians who've got child care are getting improved support because of the Albanese Labor government. We increased rent assistance—the biggest rise in decades—because we know how hard it is. They opposed that. Medicare bulk-billing has come in three times—the largest rise in support for Medicare in 30 years. They opposed that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government is absolutely committed to supporting Australians in the good times and in the tough times. We are investing this money in Australians to help our fellow Australians get through the difficult periods, boosting income support payments and making sure people can go to TAFE and get retrained fee-free so they can get a job and manage the challenges of this economy. We are building more affordable homes and expanding paid parental leave. These are things that the Labor will do to support people through the challenges that lie with us and ahead.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KOVACIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  What a challenging day for Australian mortgage holders. When I stood here on 5 September and gave my first speech, I talked about how somebody under 40 years of age in Australia is less likely than at any time in our history to own their home. The RBA decision to raise rates again in the midst of this cost-of-living crisis, in the midst of this inflationary crisis, has further embedded that. What a sad state of affairs when young Australians are unable to aspire to own their own home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have listened with great interest to the different commentary and answers from the other side to the questions from Senator Scarr and Senator Hume. In particular, I noted a couple of references to the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, about the pride in his work and what he's done. I want to read a note about the Treasurer. I just thought I would go back to a comment from Senator Farrell, which was that we are dealing with a whole bunch of issues coming at us internationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's be clear. Prior to the election, when international headwinds were also impacting our economy, Jim Chalmers said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The former government had an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing. They want to talk about international comparisons. Australians couldn't give a stuff what inflation is in the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But here today we heard comparisons about international inflation and international interest rates whereas Jim Chalmers said, 'Australians couldn't give a stuff.' That's the standard that this Treasurer set but has not lived up to. He has no plan to bring down inflation in Australia and is leaving it to the RBA to do the heavy lifting in relation to inflation. Consistent with that, it means that Australian mortgage holders, the 33 per cent of Australians that have a mortgage, are the ones doing the heavy lifting to manage inflation in this country. Let's think about that. It is the one-third of people who have struggled to save and put money aside who are being burdened with the additional costs of managing inflation in this country because this government is unable to do so. Because Jim can't live up to the standard he set for himself, interest rates will be higher for longer, Australian families will continue to suffer and more young Australians will not be able to get into their own homes and that is a very sorry state of affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things I wanted to talk about was the comment Senator Farrell made. He said, 'We have rejigged spending based on our commitments made to the Australian public before the last election.' I had a think about that and the two main commitments that I could think about were to reduce your electricity bill by $275 and to give you a cheaper mortgage. I can tell you right now, I don't know a single Australian who has saved a single dollar on their electricity bill. That is one thing that categorically has not occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know that the average Australian family or household with a mortgage is paying $22,000 a year more. Senator Farrell made a comment that confused me. As some of you may know, I spent nearly two decades helping people buy their own homes, so I have a good understanding of what an average loan size is. Senator Farrell said 'an average loan size of $360,000'. I thought, 'That's pretty low.' We had a look at the ABS data and $360,000 is not an average home loan. The average home loan in New South Wales, according to the ABS, is $764,000. In Victoria, it's $600,000. Nationally, it's $603,000. So that $360,000 figure is probably from somebody who got their loan 15 years ago and is halfway through paying it off, not someone who has to deal with the high cost of entering a home loan in the last one or two years and facing 12 interest rate rises.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Watt) to a question without notice I asked today relating to weapons exports.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Few people know that Australia has one of the most secretive and unaccountable weapons export systems in the world. Our government doesn't tell us who we're exporting weapons to, it doesn't tell us what the weapons are, and it doesn't tell us who profits here in Australia from the sale of weapons. Indeed, what we do know is that Australia has a sorry history of selling weapons to regimes that are engaged in some of the ugliest conflicts on the planet: selling weapons to both sides of the conflict in South Sudan, to both South Sudan and Sudan; selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, which is currently involved in the appalling conflict, riven with human rights abuses, in Yemen; and, of course, selling weapons after weapons after weapons to Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather remarkably, Australia's secrecy on weapons sales contrasts poorly even with the United States. The US, amidst massive public pressure for their fuelling of war crimes, have sought to hide and were seeking to hide the weapons they were sending to Israel. That was considered, in the US context, a serious breach of basic transparency measures and rejected by the US Congress. But, in Australia, we would call that secrecy the norm. Indeed, let that sink in. We are more secretive and less accountable in the way that we export weapons than the US military-industrial complex. There are more secrets about Australia's exports than there about those of the US. If you really want to find out about Australia's weapons purchases, most often you'd find it out from disclosures in the US Congress. Australia should not be fuelling war crimes, and Australia should be transparent about the weapons it's sending to fuel conflict around the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read a quote from the Executive Director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, Rawan Arraf. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's role in exporting arms material to Israel must be exposed. If Australian-made weapons are being used against Palestinian civilians, our clients and the public deserve to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that hundreds of permits have been issued in recent years, but the Australian government keeps the basic details secret. What items are being exported? Who is making them? What are they used for? These are very valid questions that Rawan asks, and they're questions the government should answer. More than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive nearly a month ago—hospitals, universities, schools, homes and ambulances all attacked. The Australian public has a right to know if any of that appalling conflict was fuelled by Australian weapons.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During question time today, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence why he is giving our diggers a pay cut for Christmas. Why are the minister and the Chief of the Defence Force behaving like a grinch? As we heard in the last round of estimates, the Australian Defence Force, over the last two years, has lost nearly 8,000 members of our forces, and it's pretty clear to me and most veterans out there why this is happening. It's because of pay and conditions. In response to our ADF bleeding its members, the minister has given our soldiers, aviators and sailors a pay rise below the rate of inflation, which, of course, is a pay cut. Add to this the fact that this government has given new recruits a cash bonus to stay for longer while there is no bonus offered for serving members to encourage them to stay. And now they will have to swallow a pay cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May 2022, the now Prime Minister said 'a Labor government would ensure Defence has the resources it needs'. I'm assuming he wasn't talking about the billion-dollar submarines we won't get for 20 years—and that'll be on a good day—not to mention the fact that Defence is still refusing to release documents to the veterans royal commission. Seriously, who would want to go and work for an employer like that? On 25 October, a press release from the Minister for Defence's office said that the Albanese government was delivering on its promise to keep Australians safe. But I reckon they're stuffing it up, and today I was joined in this belief by retired army chief General Peter Leahy. Leahy told the ABC today that the government's decisions 'are ripping the heart out of defence'. He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's military is now less capable and ready for potential threats than when Labor first came to office.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How about that? We've got problems with national security. There is no time to fix this. The Chief of Defence Force can give our diggers the pay rise they deserve, and if he doesn't then he should resign along with your Minister for Defence because I can tell you he is going down. They are calling him the worst minister they have seen in a very, very long time representing them in defence, and you know who he is. Get rid of both of them! </span>

                  </a>  Since August, judicial immunity in Division 2 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia has been called into question by a court ruling which found that judges can be personally liable for the way they conduct a case. This has had immediate negative consequences, particularly for Australian families going through the family law courts. The coalition has repeatedly called for the Attorney-General to restore the immunity of Division 2 judges so that they can decide cases without fear, favour or the threat of personal liability. We welcome the government's decision to come to the table on this issue. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCOA) (Division 2) is Australia's largest federal court. It has jurisdiction to hear a broad range of family law, migration and general federal matters. It is the single point of entry for all federal family law disputes. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) is also the only inferior court at federal level. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1), and each of the other federal courts, are superior courts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The expression "inferior court", it is important to note, is not a pejorative. It is a legal term of art. The common law has long recognised distinctions between the jurisdiction and powers of superior courts and inferior courts. In the recent decision of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stradford (a pseudonym) v Judge Vasta</span>, a justice of the Federal Court of Australia drew on centuries of common law to conclude that judges of the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 2) have more narrow protection under the doctrine of judicial immunity than do their counterparts in superior courts, including the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 1). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Judicial immunity protects judges from personal liability for actions done as part of their judicial functions. This ensures judicial independence and, in turn, supports each person coming before the court receiving an impartial and fair decision. Judges must be able to decide matters before them in accordance with their assessment of the facts and their understanding of the law, without the threat of being personally sued. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The approach in the Bill is simple. It would extend the more settled and broader common law immunity that applies to a judge of a federal superior court to judges of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). This achieves the aim of providing clarity, without unduly attempting to codify the scope of judicial immunity for federal judges. It will also allow for the doctrine to be refined over time by future decisions of the courts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The consequential amendments in the Bill will also ensure there is no confusion about the immunity afforded to arbitrators, mediators, registrars and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Chief Executive Officer after the change to Division 2 judges' immunity. There is no change to the existing policy that certain officers undertaking particular quasi-judicial functions receive the same immunity as would a judicial officer exercising the same function. </span>

However, we undertake to table the report in the Senate for the information of all senators after the meeting has taken place.

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today is my daughter's 12th birthday, and to be honest I was glad that she felt excited, she had been counting down to it since the beginning of this month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But last night she was like, "you know what I wish for my birthday? I just wish that it won't be my death day. I wish I won't be targeted by a rocket and the people won't have to say 'wow, she was killed the same day that she was born.'"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then this from Hoor, again, a 15-year-old living in Gaza right now—a 15-year-old girl who has survived four wars: 'I'm not sure that I will do the same during this fifth terrible war. It is completely different; death accompanies people in Gaza every single second. I'm not sure that I can finish my statement before an Israeli rocket splits me into pieces.' Both of these stories come directly to us from Oxfam in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Save the Children provided the story of a worker, whose name has been removed from this speech just to safeguard their identity. They are a father of four, currently sheltering in a facility with 20,000 others. He talks, in his communication with us, about what it means to be a displaced person in Gaza, what it means to be one of the hundreds of thousands of people forcibly displaced by the Israeli carpet bombing and ground invasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He says: 'Displacement means that there is no mattress or pillow. Your mattress is the floor or your car and a your cover is a sheet that has been found in a warehouse where it has sat for years. Displacement means there is no clean water to drink. You may have to, if you find it, drink contaminated water full of diseases. Displacement means that there is no cooked food—no food at all, except a few boxes of cheese which smell rank from the heat. Displacement means that there is a loaf of bread to split into two or possibly into four. Whatever it is, it is never enough. The important thing that you count is that you have managed to eat. This is considered a great achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Displacement means that you look up to the sky 30 times every minute, imagining a new massacre will happen to you and the latest breaking news will be about you and your family. Displacement means you will always hear bombing around you. You will see it, but you will never know where it is coming from. Displacement means that there is no electricity, except by chance or luck. There is no mobile phone battery, there are no phone calls or messages, there is no internet and there is no communication with the world. You may die, and no-one in your family will know that you have died. Displacement means oppression, anxiety, tension, hunger, sweat, distress, disillusion, sadness, darkness, anticipation, fear for the children, fear for the family, fear for the friends and fear for the future.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is from stories like this, human stories representing the millions attempting to survive right now in Gaza, that the Australian community draws its courage to confront its government which daily fails to call for an end to this slaughter, to the carpet bombing, to the siege and to the collective punishment of 2.2 million people. Shame on the government for not rising and drawing that same courage to join with them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Today, 7 November, marks precisely one month since the 7 October attacks by Hamas, one month since the horrors of Hamas's attacks upon innocents—innocent lives lost on that deadly day and, of course, tragic innocent lives lost in the time since. There should be no forgetting the horrors that occurred on 7 October: the targeting, deliberately, of civilians by Hamas—babies, children and the elderly—and the barbaric nature of those attacks, with the beheadings, rapes and torture that was undertaken. We should, today, one month on, mourn all of the innocent lives lost—those taken by Hamas through those attacks of 7 October and those lives that have been lost in the subsequent war, a war where Hamas has acted in the most cowardly of ways, hiding behind civilians and civilian infrastructure and therefore ensuring the greater loss of innocent lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas rocket launchers have been found in mosques, in scout halls and next to kindergartens or schools or UN offices. This is the brutality and the barbarity that the world confronts: an organisation not just intent on attacking and taking the lives of those whose existence they oppose—Israeli people and Jews—but happy to put the people they pretend to represent in harm's way—namely, Palestinian residents within Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember those still held hostage, 240 innocent people who have been living a hellish existence and whose families continue to be put through hell. Of course, we should remember all impacted by the dislocation of peoples, especially within Gaza, the humanitarian situation and the challenges that that presents for so many and the loss of life that creates, along with those dislocated in other parts of Israel. As in all wars, the loss of innocent lives is a tragedy, be they Palestinian lives, Israeli lives or any other lives. Everyone would wish to live in a world without war, but, sadly, we have to live in the real world—one where you have to deal with its horrors, not simply wish them away. Hamas is one of those horrors that Israel must deal with and that the world must deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion from the Greens does two things of note. It calls for a ceasefire, but it totally ignores Hamas. It is reckless, misleading and one-sided. What would the best way to a ceasefire be? It would be for Hamas to surrender its arms, its infrastructure, its military capabilities and its terrorist capabilities; for Hamas leaders and terrorists to surrender and face the justice they should face; and for Hamas to release the 240 hostages it still holds. These would be the best ways to a ceasefire, not simply a call for some type of ceasefire that would enable Hamas to rearm, regroup and reorganise and, in doing so, perpetuate the likelihood of more terrorist attacks or more brutal attacks like those we saw on 7 October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is easy, and it requires strong, thoughtful and considered approaches. Ideally, it requires the type of bipartisanship that this chamber exercised following 7 October and that I want to see us continue to exercise: strength in our condemnation of Hamas, strength in our desire to see Palestinians and Israelis given the opportunity to live in peace. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The widespread human suffering we are witnessing means that a just and enduring peace in the region could not be more pressing.

They cannot and should not be justified. With more than 200 people still held captive, we call for Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all hostages. In Israel's response to those attacks, thousands of Palestinians have been killed, including more than 3,500 children, as reported by UNICEF. In affirming Israel's right to defend itself, Israel's friends, including Australia, have consistently emphasised that the way it does so matters. We continue to call for international law to be observed and for the protection of civilian lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens by the day. On 26 October, Foreign Minister Wong announced that Australia would provide an additional $15 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by the conflict in Gaza, in the West Bank and across the region. This funding is in addition to the $10 million already committed by the Australian government and brings our total package of assistance to $25 million since 7 October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are serious constraints preventing this and other aid getting to the people who need it. While there has been some access, much more assistance is required from parties to the conflict if this aid is to reach Gazans. This is why so many countries, like Australia, have been calling for humanitarian pauses on hostilities as a necessary first step. The government has heard the calls for a ceasefire. The tragic reality is it can take a long time to reach a ceasefire between parties to a conflict. The people of Gaza can't wait for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> It's clear that the Australian communities are experiencing deep distress and pain, felt most acutely in our Jewish and Palestinian communities. It is essential that we do not let the very real pain caused by this conflict drive Australians apart. With this in mind, the government has developed a social cohesion package to support Australian communities affected by the ongoing conflict. This includes a $25 million grant to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry to immediately improve safety at Jewish schools and preschools across Australia, and $25 million to Australian Palestinian, Muslim and other communities to support a range of safety, security, mental health, cohesion and education objectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the role of every senator and every member in this place to remember they also have a responsibility when engaging in this debate. We all have a responsibility to engage responsibly, respectfully and constructively. Engaging in inflammatory rhetoric not only is extremely harmful to many Australians but also undermines some of our greatest strengths: our diversity, our tolerance and our values. And it does nothing to advance the cause of peace, a cause which is the responsibility of everyone in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Today, one month on from the Hamas terrorist attack, we mourn the 1,400 civilians killed. We repeat our call for the immediate release of the 240 civilians taken hostage. We grieve for the 10,000 civilians reported killed in the intervening period. Forty per cent of those who have died in Israel's bombardment of Gaza are children—over 4,000 innocent young lives lost. This cannot go on. Behind each of these numbers are people—people with families, lives, dreams and aspirations; people who matter; people who all have equal worth. Together, all Australians must call for a ceasefire and an enduring end to the cycle of violence paid for in civilian lives.</span>

Israelis are not Benjamin Netanyahu. Palestinians are not Hamas. We must call out antisemitism. We must call out Islamophobia. Every person in our communities around Australia must at all times feel safe. Hate speech cannot be tolerated. Nobody has the right to play politics with this unprecedented human suffering. I stand here to plead with all of you in this place and all around Australia: please come together to call for a ceasefire now.</span>

More than 10,000 Palestinians have died, and lasting peace is now further out of reach. We grieve with those who have lost loved ones, and we must all work now to stop further bloodshed. Instead of backing the invasion, Australia should be part of an international push for peace and de-escalation, which means an immediate ceasefire, an end to the invasion of Gaza and holding to account those who have committed war crimes.</span>

They gather united by a single call: 'Ceasefire now.' They remind their governments that children should never be killed in war and that cutting access to food, water and medicine are war crimes. I ask the Albanese government: why can't you join these calls for a ceasefire? How many children must die or be wounded, how many refugee camps or ambulance convoys bombed, how many apartment blocks reduced to rubble before you can say the word 'ceasefire'? Every moment we delay calling for a ceasefire costs lives. Nothing can justify the violence that we've seen. The Greens will continue to call for a ceasefire now and for a lasting and just peace.</span>

They are laughing at just how gullible the Greens are, doing the bidding of terrorists who cut the heads off babies and rape and kidnap people. The only sustainable path to peace in this case is the destruction of Hamas. Only then can Israel possibly consider a ceasefire. If the Israelis ceased fire before then, Hamas would survive to commit more atrocities, because these maniacs will not rest until every Jew in the world is dead, and that is simply not acceptable. The world will not be safe until these terrorist maniacs are dead. I tell people a vote for the Greens is a vote for terrorism. We need to stand up and say, 'No more of this,' because the world has seen these terrorist people on our streets supporting Palestine and Hamas. They are a destructive force and they must be stopped.</span>

The UN has warned that the Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide. The Greens condemn the war crimes of Hamas, but nothing can justify the war crimes we are witnessing in Gaza. Ten thousand Palestinians, including 4,000 children, have been brutally killed just for being Palestinian. The international community, including Australia, must take action to help end this crisis. Instead of supplying military equipment to Israel, Australia should be calling for peace and de-escalation, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and for ending the occupation of Palestine. Supporting the UN call for a ceasefire is the bare minimum that the Australian government should be doing, and yet they refuse to do so. History will be on the side of those who condemn the indiscriminate killing of civilians and condemn the occupation. We must not let our government get away with supporting these atrocities.</span>

Together, we are powerful. Please email and call the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, and call your local MP. Their staff will answer, and it's their job to listen to you. There's nothing to be afraid of. Our voices are powerful, and we can't let them ignore us. Don't underestimate the power of these actions. I have received thousands and thousands of your e-mails. They are impossible to ignore, and they demonstrate the power of collective action.

Over 10,000 people have died in a human catastrophe, with the largest price paid for by the innocent: civilian men, women and children. One thousand four hundred innocent Israelis died on 7 October, and close to 10,000 Palestinians have died in the months since. We all count, or nobody counts. As we hold our children and families close, every Australian must share the grief of this catastrophic loss of life and injury. Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children. According to the UN, more journalists have been killed over the past four weeks than in any conflict over the past three decades. Eighty-one United Nations workers have been killed, more than in any comparable period in the history of the UN. </span>

So many South Australians have contacted me, sharing their horror at what they are seeing in their homes every night, and they've asked me and the Greens to stand up for a ceasefire. To quote just one, Jessie Edwards wrote to me a few days ago speaking of her 'deep distress' about the lack of humanitarian support from our government to the people of Gaza. She said the bombing and the collective punishment of civilian Palestinians shocked her conscience. She wrote: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for a ceasefire is internationally recognised. We've have seen 120 nations at the UN vote in favour of a ceasefire. Australia abstained—well, shame on us. I am ashamed that our government did not join these countries and their call, did not listen to have thousands of Australians who are horrified and calling for peace, for the release of all hostages and political prisoners and access for humanitarian aid into Gaza. When we look back at the atrocities of history, we often wonder what we would have done. Well, we will be judged by history. We will be asked what we did to stop this horrific war, where the casualties amongst 2.4 million Palestinians and especially their children are rising so rapidly with over 4,000 children dead. It is unbearable. Right now we see our communities, so many Australians, joining millions around the world marching for peace. I joined with them, and we join with them calling for a ceasefire immediately in Gaza and an end to the illegal war crimes being perpetrated on the innocent. We need a lasting and just peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. </span>

The killing in Palestine has reached its cold hand deep into the diaspora here, with so many losing loved ones, friends and colleagues. There's so much hurt right now not even being acknowledged by this place. Imagine how hard it would be to concentrate on catching the train to work or picking up your kids on time when someone you loved has been buried in rubble and your government refuses to call for that violence to end. Imagine the sense of abandonment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of a government that is complicit in the violence, Australians are showing up in their thousands and in their millions, calling for peace and seeing a common humanity in the inexcusable tragedy of every Israeli child and every Palestinian child killed in this conflict. They're not just marching; they're sending thousands of emails to your offices and they're calling your offices every day. As I speak now, a group of Australian Jewish women is gathered in front of the Israeli embassy in Canberra to add their voices for a just peace, the freeing of the hostages and an immediate ceasefire. That's solidarity, courage and principle.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  Who said this, 'My New Year's resolution is just to continue to deal with cost-of-living pressures.'? That was what the Prime Minister told Australians back in January. Since then, we have had five interest rate rises from the RBA and a total of 12 since this government was elected. The reason behind these interest rate hikes is because Labor has no plan to tackle inflation. Inflation remains far too high, far too sticky and it is not coming off. The latest data from the September quarter reveals that inflation is stubbornly high, standing at 5.4 per cent for year on year—</span>

                  </a>  Acting Deputy President, please tell Senator Farrell not to demonstrate his economic ignorance in this chamber. The latest data for the September quarter reveals that inflation is stubbornly high, and the Treasurer will tell you that this is because of international factors. He'll tell you that it's everybody's fault other than his own. He even said recently, 'We've got a very unpredictable, volatile global economy,' and he spoke of what they had been able to do in the year since that first budget. Yet in April last year, he said: 'This government has an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing. They want to talk about international comparisons'—wait for this!—'but Australians couldn't give a stuff what inflation is in the United States.' That's the standard that the Treasurer has set for himself, and it's a standard that he is clearly failing. Core inflation—the key measure of underlying price pressures—is now at 5.2 per cent. That's higher than in Germany. It is higher than in the United States. It is higher than in France, Italy, Japan and Canada. That data simply confirms what every Australian family is feeling: the cost of everything is going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision by the RBA today to increase rates by 25 basis points has taken the cash rate to its highest level since 2011. That's a heavy blow to Australian families, especially those who were already facing financial difficulties. Because of the inaction of this government and its failure to tackle inflation head-on, a family with a $750,000 mortgage is now paying nearly $24,000 a year more than they were a year ago. Every time interest rates go up, we see an unfortunate increase in the number of Australians who turn to hardship payments for their energy bills or seek assistance from charities, particularly those that help put food on the table. This isn't just a statistic; it's a reflection of the real impact on people's lives. It's a consequence of a government that, for the past year and a half, has had the wrong priorities. It lacks a clear plan to tackle inflation. It lacks a plan to reduce the cost of living for ordinary Australians by tackling the causes, not the symptoms. The government has focused on everything except a plan to tackle inflation and get it under control. While the RBA has had to do all it can to try and cool the economy, Labor has added $188 billion of new spending, further fuelling inflation. It has added a tax on truckies and a tax on farmers, both of which add to the costs that Australians are paying at the supermarket. The RBA has its foot on the brake, but Labor is pumping the accelerator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the RBA confirmed that the result of the government's irresponsible failure to come up with a plan for inflation is higher interest rates. The governor said, 'The risk of inflation remaining higher for longer has increased'—not decreased but increased—'and it's the everyday Australians that are shouldering the financial burden.' Under Labor in the last 15 months, the cost of food has gone up by 8.2 per cent. The cost of housing has gone up by 10.4 per cent. The cost of electricity—which they promised they would reduce—has gone up by 18.2 per cent. The cost of gas has gone up by 28 per cent. Australia's inflation is now higher than that of most advanced economies. This is Labor's cost-of-living crisis. Rising interest rates caused by Labor's failure to deliver a plan to fight inflation is having a cascading effect across the economy, on businesses—particularly small businesses that struggle to access affordable credit to grow and employ more people—and on Australian families, who are suffering the consequences of Labor's inaction. It is crucial that Labor realign their priorities and policies and come up with a plan to tackle inflation, or it's going to be ordinary Australian families that continue to pay the price.</span>

                  </a>  A trillion dollars in debt, Senator Polley. They are saying that these are the answers—sorry, they're not saying what the answers to the cost-of-living crisis are, because there are cost-of-living problems. There are challenges for everyone's hip pocket, and we as a country, as a government, as a Senate and as a parliament have to make sure that we take those pressures off. We have to strive to make sure that this is done in a sensible and economically sound way but also in a way that makes a real difference for hardworking Australians—for all Australians out there who are striving in these difficult times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what have we done? We've invested $23 billion to deal with cost-of-living pressures. There is an incredibly important 10-point plan that we've implemented—a plan that's gone through everything from investing in energy bill relief to cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, increased rent assistance and building more affordable homes. These are critical steps in making sure that we take the burden off our broad community. Another is fee-free TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, on every one of those things that we've been doing and many others on those cost-of-living pressures—from the first and second ones right through to the 10th—those opposite have opposed it. They've said to the Australian public and the Australian people: 'We're going to abandon you. We are not going to support you through these cost-of-living challenges that we have right across the community right now.' Of course, when it comes to policies to make sure that we help the most needy but also bring people together to get productivity up—such as fee-free TAFE, child care and early childhood education—they opposed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you start talking about some of the instruments to make sure that there is more effective bargaining so that wages can rise, what do they do? The Liberal and National parties are for low wages. They aren't for better business, they aren't for better rights, they aren't for better wages and they certainly aren't for better productivity, because they're opposed to fee-free TAFE, which unleashes the opportunity to have more apprentices and tradespeople out there in the community. What they've done is to oppose every arrangement to make sure that people have an opportunity to deal with the cost-of-living pressures, whether it's the 10 point plan, on which they opposed every issue, or important initiatives on the employment front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the secure jobs, better pay act that the government passed at the end of last year, they opposed it. What did they oppose? They opposed the fact that employers can get together with their workforce across industries to have commonality and come up with arrangements based on productivity, efficiency and better wages. They opposed that, because heaven forbid! Would you want to see workers, companies and industries come together and try to work out solutions? What a horrific idea! Of course you do, because any sane, good employer wants that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the opposition are about is going to the lowest ebb every time. They want to go to the bad employers, the ones that are striving to bring unregulated gig work into arrangements where people don't have minimum rights. They want to make sure the big end of town are looked after, such as the mining industry. As for same job, same pay, they want to oppose that. They want to make sure that companies like Qantas can continue to create the Joyce effect that's starting to roll across the economy. They're supporting Alan Joyce, Richard Goyder and their like and then turning around and saying that the policies that have been implemented so that the workforce can deal with the cost-of-living pressures are something that they're not prepared to do.</span>

It's a painful point when they opposed bill after bill after bill. They opposed worker right after worker right after worker right. They opposed every suggestion from good employers about how to get the economy working together. They oppose it because they always go for the big end of town to make sure that, as far as they're concerned, they're looked after instead of the rest of the community and good employers who want to work together to make this country more productive, more efficient and fairer, with better business, better wages and better rights.

                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  Neoliberalism is built on conning people and basically lying to people about what's possible, what's not possible, what has to happen and what can't happen. One of the great lies of neoliberalism is that the Reserve Bank of Australia is an independent body. We hear it from the media, the opposition, the commentariat and the government—and, boy, did we hear it on high repeat from Treasurer Jim Chalmers today at his press conference. It's funny how we hear it more and more from the agents of neoliberalism, like Mr Chalmers, on days when the RBA jacks up interest rates, as it did today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A simple perusal of the Reserve Bank Act—in particular section 11 of that act—makes it clear that the government has the power to override the Reserve Bank when it puts up interest rates. The problem that we've got is not that the power to override the RBA doesn't exist but that the agents of neoliberalism, including Mr Chalmers today, are too gutless to use it. Not only is Mr Chalmers too gutless to use that power; he wants to give it away. And the Liberals and Nationals are going to support him to give that power away. Colleagues, in a democracy the buck should stop with elected representatives, not unelected technocrats like the board of the RBA—the high priests of neoliberalism in this country. Today's interest rate rises are Labor's interest rate rises because Mr Chalmers has the power to override the RBA but he's too gutless to use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's RBA decision is a terrible decision that will cause massive hardship to renters and mortgage holders across the country, and push millions of Australians further into poverty and economic hardship. It is beyond belief that the RBA would raise rates even though, as they said in their statement today, they acknowledge that inflation has peaked and is coming down. It also beggars belief that Treasurer Jim Chalmers would sit on his hands and allow that to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Average Australians did not cause this inflation crisis and they shouldn't be punished to solve it. Inflation figures are being driven by things that are out of the control of the RBA and the Australian government, like petrol prices internationally, as well as things that are within the control of the Australian government, like corporate price gouging. Labor has got to step in.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  I commend Senator Hume for bringing this matter before the Senate right now because it is a very important issue. There is no bigger or more important issue than what Australians are facing right now, which is the rising cost of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would, however, point out that, while the government have no plan to bring down inflation, they are doing something even more reckless than that. Their policies are actually driving higher inflation. We don't need any more reminders that we are facing rampant inflation caused by the government's decisions than we've seen today, with the RBA's decision to increase interest rates by another 0.25 per cent. The government are very fond of blaming everyone else but themselves for high inflation. They should look in the mirror and see that they are, in fact, the ones who are responsible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of inflation is not just arbitrary. Its effect is uneven and it's being felt by everyone across the economy, from families to businesses. Even worse, inflation's pernicious impacts are felt daily because families never feel that they're able to get ahead with their household budget. And, boy, are families feeling that right now. This further increase to mortgages today is impacting Australians terribly, and we are seeing that impact. Any MP or senator who spends time in their community will know exactly what I'm talking about. Any wage increase that people gain evaporates instantly at the fuel pump or the supermarket checkout. Cost of living is the biggest issue that this country is facing, yet we're not seeing the government step up to the plate and deal with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go through the electorates of Tangney and Burt, which are close to my home, people tell me they are struggling to get by. And it's not just in the mortgage belt areas, the newer parts of those electorates, or the outer suburbs; it's even close to town, where people would be more affluent. People across the board are feeling it, and this government is not doing anything to deal with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At last month's meeting the RBA made this observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Real household disposable incomes had declined by 3 per cent over the preceding year, as strong growth in nominal aggregate labour income had been more than offset by high inflation and rising tax and net interest payments. This had resulted in a period of weak growth in household consumption, including a decline in per capita terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet the Treasurer keeps saying that there is nothing to see here and nothing that he can do to get inflation under control. It's all Russia's fault. It's because of the rising cost of fuel that's impacting upon Australians. The government can do something about it. They can't just shift the blame. The government can control aggregate demand, which is adding fuel to the inflation fire, by cutting fiscal spending. They can do that. They can get more money from people's pay packets into their pockets by bringing in tax cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government doesn't tame inflation, it will become sticky and persist for longer. As the RBA said in its decision today:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if high inflation were to become entrenched in people's expectations, it would be much more costly to reduce later, involving even higher interest rates and a larger rise in unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA has already indicated that inflation won't be back to the two to three per cent target band until late 2025. What does this mean for Australians? Are we going to continue to experience high rates of inflation because the government are not taking action to reduce the pressures upon the economy that are driving up inflation? They're putting fuel on the fire by bringing in things like the industrial relations reform, the so-called closing loopholes bill. All that is going to achieve is greater reliance on and influence of unions in our workplaces. It will decrease productivity in the workplace, which of course we know will add further fuel to the inflation fire that this government is not taking control of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I am delighted to make a contribution to this debate. If you listened to the contributions from senators on the other side of the chamber, you will have heard them rewrite history. And if you listened to Senator McKim's contribution you will understand why the Greens will never have to be accountable. They'll never be a government of the day to deliver anything—and thank goodness. What I want to put on the public record is this: 'The IMF concludes that fiscal policy and monetary policy are working together to address inflationary pressures.' That's what they've said about the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that inflation is a big issue in the cost of living. But every time those on the other side have had the opportunity to support legislation to help Australians deal with the cost of living, what have they done? They've voted against that legislation. Of course we want inflation to come down. Of course we want interest rates to come down. That's why we're doing what we can, taking responsibility as a government, to help Australians get through this crisis. We've invested $23 billion in cost-of-living relief, and that's actually working. If you went out and talked to everyday Australians, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would understand that that $23 billion in electricity bill relief has meant something to people. Cheaper child care is having a huge impact in my home state of Tasmania. We've increased rental assistance—the biggest increase for 30 years. Hello, senators over there. What did you do when you were in government? You did zilch when it came to rental assistance. We have done more in terms of reducing the cost of medicines. We brought in the 60-day prescription. The former government in 2018 had the same proposition put to them, but they weren't prepared to do it. We've done it because we know that it's going to help those people who rely on regular medication and reduce their costs. It will also reduce the impact on GPs; the people won't have to run to see their GP as often to get their regular medication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've invested in fee-free TAFE. What did they do over the 10 years that they were in government? This is not blaming them. This is about putting on the public record the reality, and that is that you ran TAFE into the ground. You did not invest in any training or skills in this country. You allowed company after company to leave this country and go overseas. That's what you oversaw. You oversaw the car industry folding. That's what you did when you were in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have invested into the housing crisis in this country. What did they do with the $10 billion Future Fund? How did they go about supporting that legislation? They didn't; they voted against it time and time again, because, quite frankly, they do not care about people who are doing it tough in this country. They don't care about providing affordable and social housing for the most disadvantaged people in this community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a senator come into this chamber today, saying: 'Woe is me. We should not be demanding that we have 24/7 nurses in aged care.' They were in government for 10 years and they ran aged care in this country into the ground. That's what they did year after year. And what did Mr Dutton do when he was Minister for Health? He took a billion dollars out of the health budget. The reality is—</span>

                  </a>  I have been talking about inflation, but I also want to talk about the things that are helping families. You don't like to hear the truth. In terms of creating jobs and moving wages along, we had to rely on the Labor government to do that, because your policy in government was to keep wages down. We've expanded parental leave to support parents—in particular, supporting women coming back into the workforce. Now, we know the Liberals have a lot of problems attracting women to run for parliament. They have even more trouble getting women to vote for them, because of Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton. You can come in here and try to rewrite history, but the Australian people remember. They remember what this country was like under the Morrison government, under the Abbott government. They remember what it was like under the Turnbull government. The reality is they voted for Labor.</span>

But forget that; today we had 'the rate that stopped the nation'. What did the RBA do? They pulled the rate rise lever once again, for the 12th time since the Labor Party was elected. The Albanese government came to office promising they had a plan to lower the cost of living, a plan to lower the cost of power, a plan to lower interest rates, a plan to lower our power bills by how much? It was $275.</span>

It will continue to go down because people are coming to their senses. They honeymoon is coming to an end—finally. People have realised that Labor just cannot manage the economy. Heck, if they were a runner in the Melbourne Cup, they wouldn't have finished and they'd already be on the way to the glue factory. That's where they'd be—the glue factory.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  This afternoon we heard the rather sad but unsurprising news that the Reserve Bank has had to increase interest rates on Australian families for the 12th time. That is the 12th time since the Albanese Labor government came to power. This would have to be some kind of record but not a very good one. Do you know how many times the Reserve Bank increased interest rates under Scott Morrison and the former coalition government? Just once. The Reserve Bank met 96 times when the former coalition government was in power, and interest rates went up once. In the first 18 months of this Albanese government, the Reserve Bank has met 17 times, and interest rates have been increased on 12 of those occasions. Indeed, you could say that, under Labor, interest rates are 12 times more likely to go up than they are under the coalition. The last time interest rates were this high was during the last Labor government, in the middle of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd saga of 2011, when interest rates were, again—you guessed it!—out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party have demonstrated time and time again that they have a complete inability to manage their economy, and Australians are hurting because of it. In the last 15 months, the costs of your average Australian family's bills have gone up 7.3 per cent. Housing costs have gone up 10.4 per cent. The cost of electricity is up 18.2 per cent. The cost of food is up 8.2 per cent. The cost of gas is up a staggering 28 per cent. The cost of insurance is up 17.3 per cent. These aren't just statistics. These aren't just figures. These are the bills that Australian families are struggling to pay at the moment. The Labor Party go around parading that wages have increased by 3.6 per cent. Well, I've got news for the Labor Party. It doesn't matter if wages have gone up 3.6 per cent if the cost of everything is increasing twice as fast. And it is only going to get worse. The Labor government have had this year to try and get prices under control. This was Australia's opportunity to act. This was Australia's opportunity to help Australian families. But Labor has failed. Now we are witnessing growing conflict in the Middle East. We are witnessing major advanced economies start to shift closer to recessions. We are witnessing China approaching its slowest rate of economic growth since the fall of the Berlin Wall. We are witnessing an evermore unstable global environment, and Australian prices are going to go higher because this Labor government has not been able to get them under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last three months, housing has gone up 2.2 per cent, transport has gone up 3.2 per cent, and communication costs have gone up 2.2 per cent. But there is hope. The government can act to get inflation under control, but only if it has the political will. This inflation is not coming from Ukraine. It's not coming from Washington. It's not coming from the Middle East. It is coming from Canberra—plain and simple. This government can act. The government can allow domestic airline competition to reduce transportation costs. The government can work with states and territories to free up more land for housing development. The government can reduce the $188 billion in additional spending it has committed since elected. The government can stand up to the unions and tell them that they are taking industrial relations back to the 1970s and that it may not be the best idea in a cost-of-living crisis. But will they? All the evidence appears to the contrary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can fight inflation in this country, but only with a coalition government, because this Labor government has shown time and time again it just doesn't have the ticker for it. What we've seen over the last few months has been a Labor government focused on the politics of division, focused on a $450 million referendum and focused on spending money to help Canberra, rather than talking about costs of living. I challenge the journalists in this building to research how many times Labor ministers said 'cost of living' before 14 October. I guarantee that it will yield a nil search.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the issue with this government: they're driven by focus groups and they're driven by polling. They have lost the referendum and now they're having a panic about what Australian people care about. I can tell them this, and anybody on this side can tell them this: the No. 1 issue in Australia for the last year has been the cost of living, and it has not been helped by this Labor government. They are making the cost-of-living crisis worse because they are not getting inflation under control.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we are again: 'transmission Tuesday'. Many in this room will say, 'Why are we bringing Ross in again?' I'd say to be thankful that we haven't started our 'wind factory Wednesdays' yet!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a problem, and this particular reference looks at a very specific part of this: the rights of landholders. It's about property rights. We understand that for this process of Rewiring the Nation—this policy for diverse energy going forward—to be successful it has to have almost bipartisan support. With the changes of government over a long time, many of these things won't be built for six, 10 or 15 years. But what's happening now is not being done well. We see EISs of 28 days; the hamstringing of the AER regulation on the lowest cost to consumer; and that it sometimes costs more to do minor changes than to buy entire properties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this inquiry seeks to do is put up a long-term sustainable model by having an investigation, by talking to these people and coming up with an answer so that this policy can happen over the long term in a way that doesn't disturb farming, doesn't disturb environmental land and doesn't disturb marine parks, and in a way that all parties of government can get behind. What do we want to talk about? We want to talk about the people in Dunedoo, Oberon and other places. All these people have concerns. There's enough money going around in this process to do it better. There is enough organisation there. When we were talking out west, we talked about two 330-kVA lines, which cost $3.2 million per kilometre to run straight. But when we bend them, they cost $7 million per kilometre. What do we do? We bend them all around, we take longer, we spend twice as much and we still don't meet the farmers' needs. We talk about the Hackneys but the only area on the farm that stays non-boggy when there is heavy rain, where they can load animals and where they can put their silos, will be taken. Why do they take that land? Because it is the best place for these transmission lines. Their farm becomes non-viable, and what do they get paid for—the narrow corridor it's in. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want this inquiry to look at the fairness, the just terms of compensation. New South Wales has no legislation, nothing in the constitution about compulsory acquisition. They are not able to buy anything on the land, not able to buy the business. They are not allowed to do these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at transmission in Oberon, do you remember that two-kilometre exclusion zone of houses from wind farms or wind factory towers? That was put in place when towers were 84 metres high. The towers in Oberon are now going to be 285 metres high, 400 of them. There is only one building in Sydney taller—Sydney Tower—and they are going to build 400 towers bigger than that out there. What's worse, they are not down low; they are on a mountain. They are on a ridgeline. The entire vista will be these wind factories. Where is the just compensation for all those people affected? It does not exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get down to tin tacks. This is about property rights. This is about a person owning their property and having the right to say what goes on it and how you can do it. When they ask you to move the power lines a little bit so they can farm, if we can't compensate, why can't the owner trigger a must-buy for the entire property? Why can't the owner trigger a clause where they have to be bought out at the federal just terms rate for their property so they can continue farming unhindered elsewhere? We are seeing the community rise up about this because it is not going the right way. Up in my patch in the Hunter, we have the proposed Port Stephens offshore wind farm. There is not a commercially viable floating offshore wind farm in the world—not one. So to all those who say, 'Nuclear is not viable because it is not built anywhere,' it doesn't matter. We are doing something less viable in Australia right now, and we are up in arms again because of 28 days of EIS. How can a community come together to understand what is going on in 28 days when it has been foisted upon them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My personal view is these things don't have to stop. They need to be done better if they are to be done at all. So how can we push ahead? I know there is a tinpot little very-narrow-scope inquiry from the electricity infrastructure ombudsman out there, but he is not hearing all of those. When someone connected with that office says the pilots like the challenge in aerial agricultural flying near lines, it is rubbish. These people deserve a voice. No-one is trying to overthrow anything here; it is about trying to find a policy that all parties of government can support in the long-term. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sat in estimates and I heard how Snowy 2.0 is drawing out, how these transmission lines are taking longer than they thought they would. There is a 24 per cent decrease in investment in renewable energy this year compared to last year in FIDs. We know new generation is going slower. We know the New South Wales government is talking to businesses about keeping Eraring and all these other places open. It is time to admit the goals of renewable for 2030 are gone, so don't rush to fail. Slow down and succeed. Talk to these people about what is fair, about a way to do it. If you went to the Hackneys and said, 'We have to go here, even though we are bendy'—7.7 kilometres, with a 2.9 kilometre run through their land—and offered them $10 million, I don't know what their land is worth but I think they would be interested, and they could go and farm without this hassle. When you're talking to people down around the Riverina about VNI West, it's the same thing. The Victorian government have managed to reroute the entire plan because they wanted to for political reasons. New South Wales has to pick up how it connects because it's got to connect to Snowy. These things are going on as we speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I keep bringing up this two-tier economy. It's like <span style="font-style:italic;">Upstairs, Downstairs</span>. If the people in the cities can turn on their aircon, turn on their flat screens and charge their electric cars, they don't care what happens out there in the world. But the people that make things, grow things, mine things and care for things are out there, almost as the servants' quarters for the city, and it's not good enough. It's not good enough for them to be told how they have to live and what they have to deliver to be part of this country. It's like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Castle</span>: 'It's the Constitution; it's justice; it's the vibe.' It's about doing something in a fair way and not telling them how to suck eggs. That's the real problem with this country at the moment. Too many of us people in towers, in corporations and in places like this think we know better than others how they have to live their lives. We tell them: 'Hand over your land; it's for the good of the country. We're going through here. You don't need that dry patch. You don't need that vista. You don't need anything, because we need power.' You say to these people, 'You just want more money.' No, they don't. Most of them would take no money and no powerlines or no money and no wind farms. This isn't about money; this is about justice. This is about doing something right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so we come for the seventh time to this chamber to try and help the country with a long-term plan that won't get rolled back. I guarantee that I will not be sitting and supporting us in government if we don't do this better and roll this back, because it is wrong the way it is. Many of the people up there in Port Stephens are environmentalists who would have voted 100 per cent for people who are going to vote this motion down today. When they feel the pain, they see what we're talking about, and they are feeling the pain right across Australia—in New England, on the coast, in Queensland and down in Victoria. This is a problem that is spreading across Australia, and it will bring us all down. We come here as leaders to bring Australia together and build a better Australia. We don't come here as politicians to divide the haves and the have-nots. This inquiry is an opportunity to give people a chance to come together for a solution that will build a better Australia. It is nothing more than that. If you tell this increasingly large number of people that they don't deserve that by voting this down again, we'll see you in the last sitting fortnight, and we'll do the same thing again. And we'll see you next year, and we'll do the same thing again. And we will bring them here, and they'll be out the front, and we know what will happen. They'll be ignored out there, just as they're ignored in here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people that made this country great did things. They didn't market things, they didn't insure things and they didn't sue people over those things. They built things, they mined things, they made things and they grew things. These are the people that are suffering here. It's the people that grow your food and your fibre. We are taking their water with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We are taking their land with this. We're taking their names for products under trade deals. We're taking their staff with visa deals. We are taking everything off them and still expect them to feed us and clothe us. And then we expect to tell them how to live. We say: 'You've got to have an E zone on your property. You can't farm here. You've got to protect this. There's a left-handed butterfly living in your cactus plant; you can't do anything there.' These are the things that people in towers do. You can't virtue-signal your way to a lucky country. You can't wish your way to posterity. It has to happen. We in this chamber get it. I'm a talker. I'm here, not making anything. I'm a part-time mechanic for my son's go-kart, and that's as real as I get nowadays. But, out there, people are doing the hard yards. They are sowing, they are ploughing, they are shearing and they are milking. Dairy farmers have the hardest job in the world. Try telling a cow you can't milk it twice today because you want to go on holidays. See how that goes for you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge everyone—this is nothing other than finding a path to do something you want to do better and finding a way to look after rural and regional Australia so that they will be happy to join us in the way that you want to live and do the things you want to do. Why do we not deal with the consequences of this change? There will be 285-metre towers instead of 84-metre towers on top of mountains, acres of solar farms instead of a few solar panels and structures on whale migration tracks off Port Stephens. All of these things are happening, and no-one seems to give a damn, because we're trying to get to a number that we already admit we can't get to. Isn't it better to do it in a way that lasts forever than to do it in a way where we have to overturn it and do it the right way when we get there?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You won't get final investment decisions when there is no certainty about bipartisan support. You won't. I'm not going to invest $2 billion on something when I think that, in six months time or three years time, the government is going to change it and I'm going to pull everything on it. Come to the table. That's what we're here to do. Senator Colbeck is sponsoring this with me because it needs to be done right. It is nothing more than that. The people suffering out there deserve it, and I urge your support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  It's with great pleasure that I stand with my colleague Senator Cadell to support a motion on this matter. It's for the seventh time. It's absolutely ludicrous that the government doesn't want to hear the voices of the communities that are coming to us to express their concerns about the way that this very important infrastructure is being rolled out. The government tries to portray this as the opposition not wanting to see the development of the grid to support renewable energy and the growth in energy needs across the country. That is simply not true. That is a lie, in fact. That is not what this motion is seeking to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, because we have been talking to people—to farmers, fishers and Indigenous communities—that there are a whole range of issues in relation to equity and fairness and the terms under which lands and seas are accessed for the development of this infrastructure. We know that because we've been having the conversations. We've been talking to them. The government know there's a problem, because they've instituted their own little in-house secret-squirrel inquiry. But they don't want the voices that are talking to that process to be heard publicly, which they would be through a Senate inquiry. Communities could come and give evidence to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. Their voices could be heard in public, rather than in secret-squirrel meetings behind closed doors where their complaints can't be heard, and the full weight and support of this chamber could be brought to the government to assist it with the solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government is looking for solutions. We know that that's the case, and we want to see fair terms for access to these lands and seas and for those who are impacted. We've been told in a separate inquiry—the government's inquiry that it asked the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth to do into creating Australia as a green export superpower—that Indigenous communities get paid a lower rate in Queensland than graziers do. Tell me how that's fair. Why can't this chamber play a role in fixing that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Off Gippsland, about 20,000 tonnes of fish come out of the South East Trawl Fishery. Ninety per cent of that fishery is impacted by the zones that have currently been declared. How do we fairly manage the impact on that fishery and on the supply of seafood from that fishery into Sydney and Melbourne regional markets? How do we make sure that's properly managed? How do we do that? The government is not prepared to say, but they don't want the seafood industry to be able to come and talk to parliament or to the Senate openly about what they think the solutions are, which we might then be able to recommend to the parliament and, therefore, to the government. They don't want to have that conversation. Senator Cadell has talked about the circumstances off Port Stephens in New South Wales, and we've seen plenty of publicity recently about the concerns that the local community has there, from a whole range of perspectives. It's not just fisheries, and it's not just fisheries off Gippsland either. It's tourism. It's a whole range of other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The terms of reference for this inquiry are written in that constructive mode. How do we make sure that the way in which these energy companies and those proposing these major pieces of infrastructure access the land and seas is done in a fair way and on just terms? You would expect that that's what would happen as a matter of course, but we know that there are a whole range of dodgy type contracts that are being offered out there to farmers in particular. We know that there are issues with determining the routes along which these major pieces of infrastructure will be built. Senator Cadell has talked about the scale of some of this infrastructure, and we haven't even started talking about the potential impacts on the environment and on environmental lands, which this inquiry also wants to look at. I can't understand why the Greens aren't interested in this. I genuinely can't understand it. I say that because, in Queensland, you have the circumstance where you've got over a  thousand hectares of koala habitat impacted by the development of a major piece of infrastructure. Try and cut down a tree for any other reason anywhere in the country.</span>

                    </a>  Good point, Senator: don't try and build a dam. But you can impact native wildlife habitat—koala habitat—to build a major piece of energy infrastructure, and that doesn't seem to be a problem. WWF will get on television and tell you that you should donate to WWF because koalas are going to become extinct, yet here we have a piece of infrastructure that will impact over a thousand hectares of native vegetation that is important koala habitat. So what are the appropriate terms and conditions on which all of these things are done? That's what this inquiry would like to do. The terms of reference would include, for example, 'identifying best practice approaches to the development and implementation of a fair national approach to compulsory acquisition consultation and compensation'. Why is the government and why are the Greens voting against that? The inquiry would look into 'the efficacy of consultation processes between Indigenous landholders, farmers and fishers, and Commonwealth, state and territory governments and energy companies seeking to compulsorily access or acquire agricultural, Indigenous, national and marine parks, and protected environmental lands'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is about trying to make sure that the development of the energy grid, which is critical for Australia, is done properly. There is an extraordinary amount of work that's going to have to happen, and a huge number of communities, landowners and owners of access rights in fisheries and environmental lands are going to be impacted. All that we are looking to do is play a constructive part in that process to ensure there's a decent approach and there are nationally recognised processes, guidelines and compensation, because it's all over the shop at the moment. It is seriously all over the shop. It's different in Victoria to NSW and Queensland. A farmer in Western Australia gets less than a farmer in Queensland, and there's no ongoing payment for having transmission lines on your farm in Tasmania right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's significant work that has to be there because Tasmania will play its important role in the development of the national grid, through the construction of Basslink, which is a project jointly run between the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian and Victorian governments. It's a really important piece of infrastructure for my home state, but it will also involve connection to the grid and transmission lines across agricultural land, particularly across the north of Tasmania. There are farmers in my communities that I've spoken to who are likewise concerned. There are communities who are concerned that the projects actually go ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Burnie mayor here yesterday to talk to the energy minister to make sure that the projects do go ahead, because she is concerned that the investment that will come from these new projects will come into north-west Tasmania and benefit her community, our Tasmanian communities. It is important that these things occur. It is important, though, that they occur in an orderly way. It's important that they occur under just terms. It's important that the compensation that's received is fair. If we are going to achieve the national goals that are set to expand the grid, the last thing that we need is communities out protesting against the development. The way we go about this is the most important thing. That is the thing that's going to make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, can I tell you, at the moment, that's not what's happening. The government does not want the voices of these people, these communities, to be heard. We saw farmers come from Cairns to Brisbane to protest. For those that don't understand, it's further from Cairns to Brisbane than it is from Brisbane to Melbourne. It's a bloody long way to go to make sure that what's happening in your community is done in a fair and proper way. We had farmers in this chamber waiting for hours to hear the debate on this matter go ahead. They don't come to Canberra for no reason. The farmers do not come to Canberra for no reason. They're here because they have concerns. They're here because the government won't listen to them. They're here because they don't think they're getting a fair deal We think they should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to see the major development that is required to extend the grid to support the Australian economy—and, can I tell you, reliable, affordable energy is one of the key indicators to the economic wealth of the country and to the economic fortunes of the country—we've got to do this properly. The terms of reference for this inquiry have been written in that context, in a constructive way, so that this parliament, this Senate, can play its constructive role in ensuring that this is done properly and that we don't have farmers on tractors arriving at Parliament House in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne or wherever else—or in their local communities—to protest at the way that they're being treated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want a process that's done properly and fairly, one in which they believe and feel that they have had a fair voice. The government simply isn't there at the moment. They'll trot out their talking points. They'll tell you that this is just about people who don't want renewable energy to go ahead. Well, that's not why I'm standing here. That's not why, with Senator Cadell, I have put this motion up seven times now. I want to see my communities treated properly and fairly, and I want to see communities all over the country treated the same way. Why should a community in Western Australia get more than a community or farmer in Queensland? Why should a grazier in Queensland get more than an Indigenous owner in Queensland? Why are there dodgy contracts floating around out there at the moment?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government really does need to come to its senses on this. As Senator Cadell said, we do not intend to give up on this. This is an important matter for our communities. The government can try and dismiss it and say, 'It's all about politics and people who don't believe in renewables.' That's not true. That's not the case. The government should come to its senses and support this reference, because we want reliable energy across this country and for it to be achieved in fair and just terms.</span>

                    </a>  It is a tragedy, Senator Cadell. It's a tragedy that you and Senator Colbeck have had to move this motion seven times. For those listening to the broadcast, I think it's really important to set the scene. Why has this motion been put up seven times? It must be an extraordinarily controversial motion. It must directly criticise the government, undermine some sort of government policy or do something terribly radical. Well, in actual fact, it doesn't. No offence, Senator Cadell and Senator Colbeck, but this motion doesn't do anything radical at all. All it does is give voice, which is the one of the most important jobs this chamber has, to a group of people who want a very important issue canvassed in the forum of a Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue is the huge number of transmission lines and the other infrastructure that will be installed in Australia over the next decades, based on this government's current plan, and the disproportionate impact that that's going to have on a relatively small part of the Australian community. Transmission lines feed into the city, in general, from where the power is created, often in rural and regional areas. When they hit the city, they go through a little bit of urban land, but the vast bulk of the impact of those transmission lines and that infrastructure is on regional communities. The impact is on farmland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those communities want a say in this plan for tens of thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines, new sites for wind turbines and new sites for solar factories. They want a say in how it's going to be rolled out, how it's going to impact them, how they're going to be consulted and how they're going to be compensated. Those communities deserve to be heard. It's not too much. In fact, having this chamber, through the committee process, look at these issues is the very least that those communities should be given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not that the committee process is an adversarial one. Sometimes it gets a bit feisty, but the committee process is also a way in which future-looking bipartisan, tripartisan or otherwise multipartisan plans for contentious issues can be taken forward. In my time in this place, I have seen it time and time again. Committees have actually come together to try and reach a point of agreement and take forward a model that satisfies very divergent requirements—and the requirements are divergent. Nobody's saying that this isn't a difficult issue, but that's why we need an inquiry. It is a difficult issue. The difference between choosing path A, path B and path C for a transmission line can have dramatic impacts. It can have dramatic impacts on communities and on individual farming properties, including generational farming properties, which this chamber, through the committee system, should be empowered to look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just find it ludicrous that the Labor Party and the Greens have backed themselves into a corner, rejecting these entirely reasonable terms of reference for an inquiry. There is nothing radical in here. There is nothing that's a direct attack on the government. There's nothing that says that this committee should find that there shouldn't be allowed to be any transmission lines on anybody's farm ever again. That's not part of the terms of reference. They are very reasonable terms of reference to look at an issue that is very real and that imposes burdens, supposedly for the benefit of all society, on a very narrow part of society. It's not people in urban areas who are going to have to deal with these tens of thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines or with the wind farms and the solar farms. It simply isn't. They will see the supposed benefits of these things in time—we can have another argument about that—but the fact is that people in urban centres, people in cities, don't have to deal with the transmission lines. They don't have to deal with the massive imposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The areas we're talking about are simply staggering. One company in Western Australia is talking about 4,000 acres of solar and wind projects—one company with 4,000 acres, and that's just to power their business. That's not powering Perth. That is not powering the grid. That's just for their business. So we are talking about staggering amounts of land use into the future. Whilst perhaps on the west coast that will be slightly less than on the east coast, the fact is that the same issues are at play no matter where you are in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues deserve to be ventilated in a forum such as a Senate committee where we can hear from local communities, and we will hear a lot of different perspectives. I have absolutely no doubt about that. We are not going to hear from just one view of the world. There are plenty of people who would love to see opportunities for their patch, including economic opportunities, but let's hear about it. Let's hear about how the costs and benefits can be shared between the city and the bush. Let's hear about how the costs and benefits can be shared between those who derive revenue from these electricity generation projects and transmission lines and those who have to put up with the impost upon them. Let's hear about how we can compensate landowners for their loss of amenity and loss of property rights. If we're serious about our Constitution then we should be serious about that issue. How do we compensate property owners for the continual taking, via regulation, of their rights? Again, it's not an issue that's going to be dealt with easily, but it is something that this place should be willing to confront.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens again have an opportunity to change their minds, and I ask them to consider it. They've again got an opportunity to say: 'We got it wrong the first of six times. We should have this inquiry. We should enable a Senate committee to look at what is a very important issue'—just as literally thousands of other inquiries have been held on important and contentious issues. We'll see whether Labor and the Greens can bring themselves to support what is an entirely reasonable motion from Senators Colbeck and Cadell. We'll see whether they'll listen to the voices of those in the regions who will be directly impacted by this suite of policies, and whether they'll let them tell the Senate what they think the way forward should look like. That would be the only fair and reasonable thing to do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I remind people of what Thomas Jefferson said: we can have farming without cities yet cannot have cities without farming. No farmers, no Australia! Why does this Labor government use the states to steal property from hardworking landowners and rip off farmers left, right and centre? Why? Because it can. And it builds on actions of past Liberal-National governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before explaining that, Madam Acting Deputy President, let me say that I have a list of eight keys to ongoing, sustained human progress—just ones that I've developed over the years. The first is freedom. The second is the rule of law. The third is constitutional continuance and competitive federalism. The fourth is secure private property rights. That's fundamental. It enables freedom. The fifth is strong families. The sixth is affordable, reliable energy. Then there's fair and honest taxation and honest money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secure property rights are fourth on my list. Why? Because secure property rights are fundamental to reward for genuine effort and creativity and for investing and taking risk. People won't do that if they can't keep what they earn. Secondly, secure property rights are necessary for people to exercise initiative. Thirdly, secure property rights are necessary for people to exercise responsibility and accountability, because if you can just steal it then why would you have any accountability? The fourth fundamental about secure property rights is freedom. They enable freedom. This has been well known for centuries. One of the reasons communism and socialism always fail is that they steal property rights. And it's the reason, always, that personal free enterprise succeeds until the government—and this has happened repeatedly throughout history—gets too big and infringes on civil liberties. It destroys property rights and infringes on civil liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So secure property rights are very important, and our founding fathers agreed, because our Commonwealth Constitution recognises and enshrines the importance of secure property rights. Under placitum (xxxi) of section 51 of the Commonwealth Constitution, our Constitution, the Commonwealth may acquire property from a state or person providing it is on just terms. To put that in context, section 51 of the Constitution says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is clear—'just terms'. This means that the Commonwealth, the federal government, must pay the person being dispossessed of rights to use their land reasonable and just compensation for the property the Commonwealth acquires. If the Commonwealth interferes with rights to use land, it must pay just-terms compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generally, the states lack such property protections. Should a state acquire—or even steal, as has happened—land for a state, it does not need to provide compensation. Under state constitutions, no compensation is required. Even if a state acquires land for a Commonwealth purpose, the state is not bound under the Commonwealth Constitution to acquire it under just terms. This would then enable working around the constitutional protection for landowners, as I'm going to tell you with a story that is actually factual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a story about the worst theft of property rights in our country's history. It happened during the lifetime of everyone in this chamber. In 2007, after John Howard was booted from office, I wrote a personal letter of thanks to him. I thought highly of John Howard. I thanked him and acknowledged him for his 30 years of work and for being at the forefront of the governance and policies introduced by the Keating and Hawke governments as well as has his own government afterward. Yet I didn't know at the time something that I'm going to share with you. It was the former Liberal-National coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard who came up with the disgraceful mechanism of using the states to do the federal government's dirty work for it. This is not new. This goes back to 1996-97.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The story starts with the United Nations Kyoto protocol on climate variation and John Howard's admitted desire to comply with it. He said he wouldn't sign the 1997 Kyoto protocol but we would comply with it as a country. He or his government realised that people were not ready at that time to shut down industry, power stations, agriculture, travel and transport that produce carbon dioxide, so they came up with a different idea—a worse idea: stop the farmers clearing their land. Stop the farmers using their land as they were free to do. The Constitution, though, requires compensation. That would have been worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The federal government could not afford that, so the Howard government went around the Constitution, using the states to do the federal government's dirty work of stealing farmers' land to comply with the UN Kyoto Protocol, because John Howard's government realised that they could cut the production of carbon dioxide or they could stop the clearing of land, which would be getting credit for giving more absorption of carbon dioxide. It was the same net effect. He did it without any scientific basis, as I'll explain in a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the Howard government's early responses was to do a deal with Rob Borbidge's National Party government in Queensland. We had a National Party government in Queensland and three signatures from the senior National Party people, doing a deal with the Liberal-National federal government. They did a similar deal with Bob Carr, of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and then entrenched the deal with Peter Beattie in Queensland. Despite the denials under the Morrison government, this is still something the federal government relies upon for climate compliance. The irony is that John Howard betrayed himself as a champion of the Constitution and a champion of property rights that are fundamental to free enterprise societies. If you don't believe me on this story, ask Peter Spencer, who nearly died protesting. Ask Dan McDonald and many farmers who are awake to this in Queensland and New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, six years after being booted from office, John Howard said, as the annual lecturer on climate at the London Global Warming Policy Foundation, which is a sceptic think tank opposed to the impacts of climate policy economically, that, after doing what he did to destroy our electricity sector and steal farmers' property rights, on the topic of climate science he was agnostic. None of it was driven by climate science. Yet he led a government that stole farmers' property rights and introduced a renewable energy target that is now gutting our electricity sector—shipping manufacturing overseas because of high electricity prices, driving families broke and causing inflation. His government concocted the National Electricity Market, which is really a racket. It's not a market; it's a bureaucracy that controls prices. Contrary to what people have been saying about Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, John Howard was the first leader of a major party and of a government to put in place an emissions trading scheme as policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This set a pattern for Labor because, if you look at the history of climate policy and energy policy, the Liberal-National coalition introduces climate and energy initiatives and the Labor Party, when it comes in, then ramps them up. Have a look at the safeguard mechanism as a foundation for a global carbon dioxide tax. That was admitted when Greg Hunt, under Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership, introduced the safeguard mechanism in 2015. It wasn't Chris Bowen—he just ramped it up. The UN's net zero strategy was first introduced to Australia by Scott Morrison, and it was then ramped up by the Greens and the Labor Party. Carbon farming—or money farming—sterilises and steals and locks up the land, increasing the cost of feral animal management and noxious weed management for all the farmers in the area. Locking up land means it becomes full of weeds. For UN biodiversity policies, look at the Howard government again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to the Howard government, the 2007 Water Act and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority separated water entitlements from the land. Now we see in the Murray-Darling Basin—with the loss of property rights and water entitlements—the land is now married back up with water in the hands of corporate farmers on corporate farms. One of the aims of the Water Act, which is repeatedly stated throughout the act, is compliance with international agreements. What the hell is that doing in our legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the Labor state and federal governments. The Beattie Labor government in Queensland ramped up the stealing of farmers' property rights by imposing more restrictions on farmers' use of land, and so did Anna Bligh's government. Campbell Newman's government failed to restore property rights and just looked the other way. Annastacia Palaszczuk has since extended the stealing of property rights and entrenched it. The states have become adept at this method of stealing land from landowners, mostly as an attack on farmers, and not paying just terms compensation. Another way the states—Queensland in particular—do this is by using environmental reasons to justify placing restrictions on farmers' use of land, reducing the worth of land, preventing it from alternative productive use and preventing the development of the land for agricultural or grazing purposes. For example, the Great Barrier Reef protection legislation—contrary to the evidence of farming having no impact on the Great Barrier Reef—is having a devastating impact on communities because of the unfounded and unscientific restrictions that the Labor government has placed on farming communities up and down the east coast of Queensland. This is destroying productive land—with woody weeds under native vegetation protection legislation—and turning productive land with a bright future into a monoculture of woody weeds and no grass, which increases erosion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor federal government has declared war on farmers and primary producers. It's hijacking prime agricultural land to install banks of ugly wind turbines and poisonous and dangerous solar panels, vandalising literally acres of otherwise productive food-producing land. Any person should be able to see the stupidity, the hypocrisy and the economic devastation of such actions. In its desperate attempts to virtue signal to the world that it is a conservation and climate-saving giant, the Labor government is hell-bent on covering the landscape with expensive and inefficient wind turbines, ugly banks of solar panels—and damn the consequences. We see huge complexes of solar and wind farms built with no connection to the grid. We see it in Victoria and we see it in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they are thinking, 'We'd better build transmission lines.' Transmission lines are going to chew up prime environmental habitat and farming. Now more than 100 square kilometres of koala habitat in Queensland is under threat from the developers of these destructive wind turbine projects, all in the name of so-called renewable energy and at the cost of the environment and the extinction of rare wildlife—another aspect of killing the environment to save it. Other damage to farming by the Labor government include stopping regional infrastructure spending to improve the productivity of the regions and stopping live cattle and live sheep exports. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are hard pressed to stop the states, acting for the Commonwealth, from stealing land and attacking the property rights of farmers. The Labor government, in bed with the Greens and the teals, is pushing inhuman and antihuman policies, antienvironment policies and anti-Australian policies. Labor, Greens and the LNP, the Liberals and Nationals, are hell-bent on promoting projects that are destroying the land, destroying the environment, increasing unemployment, destroying the economy and pushing up the cost of living in Australia and reducing our security by exporting our major manufacturing. When it becomes too expensive to sip a latte in the city, even the teals might wake up to the fact that their lefty policies are making it too hard to continue living in what was the lucky country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our farmers chuck it all in, this country is lost, and the Chinese can simply walk in and create a food bowl to feed Asia. I remind you that Thomas Jefferson said, 'You can have farming without cities, but you cannot have cities without farming.' No farmers, no Australia. I haven't got time at the moment, but the stealing of property rights is not restricted to farmers. It is happening in urban environments, including Caboolture, near Brisbane. It is happening in Mosman, in Sydney. I fully support this motion from senators Colbeck and Cadell. It needs to go much further to encompass past theft of property and federal-state collusion enabling uncompensated theft of property rights with no just terms of compensation. </span>

What is our nation's electricity grid? It's like a square peg in a round hole because it's being forced to adapt to unreliable and inconsistent methods of electricity generation. That's what is going on. We have this reckless push—that's what it is—towards so-called renewable energy which is not renewable at all. What's renewable about Chinese solar panels and wind turbines that end up in landfill at the end of their useful life anyway? That's not renewable. It will only push up electricity prices, and we all know that. It's smashing Australian land holders, farmers and fishers. Prime farmland and sea life are under direct threat from our nation's ill-advised solar and wind transition. Farmers are facing compulsory acquisition or, even worse, having high-voltage powerlines imposed on them through their property, with no entitlement to adequate compensation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago what did the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, say? Antonio Gutteres informed the world that we had moved from global warming to 'the era of global boiling'. This guy is a nut case—that's what he is—global boiling! It was all very dramatic. To me it was a little bit funny, and for those of us in the Senate who eagerly wait to find out what comes after 'global boiling', perhaps it's this: perhaps next time he will come on TV and warn us about—I don't know—global microwaving. How about that? Maybe he'll tell us that we've entered the era of global molten lava. Who knows? I don't know. Do you know? This guy is nuts. But he'll be sure to come up with something dramatic in order to get a headline and keep the climate fear, which is what it is. It's like climate fear porn in the news and top of mind for the misinformed among us. That's what he is doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, I don't mind the term 'global boiling' because—do you know what?—tempers are boiling right now. Tempers are boiling at least in regional Australia, not so much in the inner city for the woke latte sipping lefty activists. But in regional areas, tempers are boiling. Farmers are boiling mad. They're boiling mad about the government's plan to litter the countryside—that's what it is—with wind turbines. What do these wind turbines do? They destroy prime agriculture land. Our very own climate high priest, Minister Chris Bowen, is telling our farmers that they must put up with wind turbines that are around 285 metres tall or something like that being plonked into their paddocks. If these hulking great turbines—these monuments to ridiculousness and madness—are not enough of a blight on the landscape, Minister Bowen is telling them that he's also, potentially, going to crisscross their properties with 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the town of Oberon in New South Wales, the government is planning on erecting around 400 of these wind turbines. The City of Sydney has got 16 buildings that are more than 200 metres tall. Oberon in the Central Tablelands would have 400 turbines that are higher than that. For the love of God, doesn't anyone care about the eagles? What about the eagles? Where are the Greens? Save the eagles! Apart from being an eyesore, the whir of just one of these monstrosities can be heard up to 10 kilometres away. Multiply that by 400 and you can start to understand why the people of Oberon are red hot about this issue. Let's be honest: of course the eyesore won't be seen from the Prime Minister's residence, and the noise pollution will not be heard in Minister Bowen's electorate or in any of the Greens or Teals members' electorates either. The Oberon community believe—not without good reason, I might add—that the proposed wind farm will damage the value of their homes, farms and businesses, and they're right. And for what? For nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Minister Bowen manages by some miracle to reach the end of his net zero rainbow, China will continue to increase their emissions—they're not stopping—and will quickly swallow up whatever gains Australia has made. We don't talk about China enough in this place, and we should. Here's the kick in the you-know-what: we buy these wind turbines from China, mostly, who manufacture them with energy supplied by Australian coal. Ridiculous! Net zero—it's this. It's nothing more than a wealth transfer to the CCP and, as my colleague Senator Roberts likes to say, global predatory billionaires. That's where it's going. You can't make this stuff up. You just can't. It's madness. No wonder Chairman Xi Jinping loves Australia so much—at least, he claims to. Few other things in life would give him as much to laugh about in his life right now than our energy policy. It's nuts. We shut our country down and send everything to China, and they laugh at us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Bowen wants to plonk 40 new wind turbines a month in regional areas every month for the next seven years. He says that it'll save the environment. No, Minister Bowen, it's not going to save anything. It's going to destroy the environment, and it's going to ruin people's lives. The pain being inflicted right now on the people of Oberon and all the other country folk across the country, from Queensland to Tasmania, needs to stop. It needs to end. If the government is serious about achieving net zero and if they're not just a patsy for China, they could do it with nuclear power and have the added bonus of not destroying the lives and livelihoods of all the rural communities. The government's stubborn refusal to even contemplate nuclear is frankly outrageous. It's enough to make country people's blood boil. There's your global boiling—the country people's blood is boiling. Listen to the concern of our farmers, Minister Bowen and Prime Minister Albanese. Rather than bullying them into accepting turbines and transmission lines that they don't want or need, listen to them. Consider nuclear instead.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you really want to shore up our power supply, for God's sake stop this madness. Once again, I will commend Senators Colbeck and Cadell for their motion. We need to investigate and expose the reality of net zero. Let's be honest for a second. Net zero makes net-zero sense when you're using solar panels and wind turbines, which—once again—end up in landfill at the end of their useful life, and batteries that last seven to 10 years, if you're lucky, and then also end up in landfill at the end of their useful life. What is the point of this? Nuclear energy is the answer. It's something I hope all the adults can agree on. It's the best way forward. If you believe in the garbage, lies and misinformation that says 'CO2 is going to kill us all,' I can tell you that it will not. It's absolute garbage.</span>

It's very competitive in this chamber! We know that this Labor government, as they were vying for election when in opposition, went to the Australian people and promised they would do things differently. They promised they would be the government of transparency and openness. We know that they are anything but. We have seen in this chamber time and time again this Labor government run from transparency and scrutiny and absolutely avoid accountability. This simple motion for an inquiry to hear from experts, impacted community members, conservationists and the departmental advisers that have been providing the government advice, which will give transparency to the Australian people about decisions being made, is being repeatedly thwarted. It's happened six times and counting. This will be the seventh time, if they vote against it. It's been thwarted by this government so they can avoid scrutiny. They did the same with the inquiry into COVID after calling, from opposition, for a robust and forensic review of the COVID response. I should know; I was on the COVID select committee.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DAVEY:</span>
                    </a>  When you were in opposition—thank you, Senator Watt—it was certainly better times, and certainly a more transparent time. But they finally got shamed into setting up the inquiry. However, it had the weakest of all terms of reference, designed to avoid scrutiny. Ironically, it was not even scrutiny of themselves. It would have provided scrutiny of a Liberal-National government, but they limited the terms of reference to protect their state mates and avoid scrutiny of their state mates. Caught out, embarrassed and shamed, they've back-pedalled to slightly expand the terms of reference. But let me make it clear that the terms still explicitly exclude the decisions of state and territory governments from being investigated by the inquiry, and that's something that clearly wasn't explained down the chain of command, because, shockingly, the minister for health, Mr Butler, incorrectly stated this morning that the terms of reference explicitly included examination of those health responses. It was wrong. It was incorrect. The health minister even went on to say that it would be extraordinary to set up an inquiry that did not examine the operation of those measures, not realising that that's exactly what his government did—not just once but twice—when they expanded the terms of reference. We saw another example just today, when, in question time, I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Minister Watt. He got up to answer the question but could not answer in any coherent way. He did not know the detail, which is something that is becoming common among this government. It was very clear that the minister did not know or care what impacts the government's policies would have on communities, which is again what we're seeing with their avoidance of this inquiry. And the list goes on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again we are seeing this government avoid orders of the Senate for the production of documents, and I am not alone in my concerns of that. We've seen representatives from the Greens and representatives from the crossbench call this government to account for failing to produce documents required by this chamber to allow us to do our jobs effectively. We all are calling for transparency, which is why I'm so astounded that the Greens persist in blocking this inquiry with the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it clear: our call for an inquiry isn't just about farmers. Transmission lines, the impacts of transmission lines, the costs of transmission lines—the cost will affect everyone—and the impact of building and constructing those transmission lines, will, yes, impact farmers, but it will also impact our landscapes, flora, fauna and amenity. Indeed, when the New South Wales parliament held an inquiry into this issue, they heard from the Animal Justice Party NSW. That's not a party I am normally prone to agree with, but on this occasion they highlighted the damage that transmission lines could have on 82 species of plants and animals in New South Wales alone. That inquiry heard from environmental activists, national parks representatives, landholders and community members who all raised significant concerns about the transmission lines, how routes are chosen, compensation offered and the impacts on their lives and livelihoods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that these lines will impact on koala habitat. We know that the transmission lines require vast swathes of landscape to be cleared. We know that there are concerns about bushfire risks. We've seen reports in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span> and other newspapers about volunteer firefighters raising their concerns about the impact of transmission lines and the increased risk of bushfires but also about how to then respond to bushfires: the impact of transmission lines on the capability for aerial firefighting services and the impact of transmission lines on the capability of using other infrastructure and other equipment in and around transmission lines if bushfires occur. I don't understand the logic of those opposite who claim that they want to save the planet but are happy to destroy Australia's environment to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have brought on this debate time and time again, and we haven't won the vote, obviously, to get an inquiry. There are ever-increasing numbers of people also raising concerns about this issue. Since we commenced our campaign to hold an inquiry, just an inquiry, into transmission lines, we've also seen an increase in protests against renewable projects. I bet the government kind of wishes they'd accepted our proposal for a simple inquiry into transmission lines at the outset, at the beginning of this process, because that might have helped them actually quell what is now becoming an increasing issue for the government. From Bob Brown and the eagle campaigners in Tasmania to the offshore flotillas of surfers going out from both Wollongong and Newcastle to protest against offshore wind farms, people who are not necessarily conservative, who are certainly not climate deniers or climate change sceptics—in fact, they are some of the most vocal proponents of the need to do something to address climate change—are the very people protesting against renewable projects, and they also have concerns about transmission lines. This is why we need to actually listen. This is why we need an inquiry. I will agree with Senator Babet. We also need to ask the question why are we continually blocking talking about nuclear? But I stray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is about an inquiry into the impact of transmission lines, how those decisions are made, how the routes are chosen, how communities and landholders are consulted with to bring them on the journey, because it has been appalling so far. Imagine getting home and finding a waterproof envelope stuck to your front door saying 'Your home has been chosen for destruction so we can put in a power pole.' That is effectively what is happening to farmers. They come home to an envelope on their gate saying, 'Lucky You. You have drawn out of the lottery and you are going to have transmission lines criss-crossing your property whether or not you like it.' So is it any wonder with this government's track record that you have even people like a brand-new president of the NFF calling out the Albanese government on their lack of consultation, on their lack of preparedness to work with farmers, landholders and regional communities to develop policy that will actually benefit Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I will just say: get on board. Let us have this inquiry then you won't have to listen to us every other Tuesday talking about it again and again. Let us have the inquiry. Let us hear from the people who want to be heard and stop avoiding scrutiny and transparency. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256136" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  Thank you, Deputy President. It is always good to see you in the chamber. I would like to thank senators Cadell and Colbeck for their concerns about this issue. There are legitimate concerns from landholders, from rural communities, from environmentalists. I have met with and enjoyed engaging with a number of them, both here in Canberra and on trips into regional and New South Wales, but I am very wary of the politics at play with this issue. We have a coalition who had a decade to look into this, to build the kinds of frameworks that we hear them talk about yet we saw nothing of the sort. We saw a total failure of leadership when it came to planning for the transition, to building the social licence, to ensuring that people in regional communities—many of whom have been reliant on fossil fuels—benefit from this transition in a meaningful way, in a long-lasting way, in a way that sets them up. With that in mind, I worked with the member for Indi, Dr Helen Haines, to secure an independent, well resourced and wide-ranging review undertaken by Andrew Dyer, the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner. Andrew Dyer commenced his work in this area in November 2015 as the National Wind Farm Commissioner—a few governments away, I guess. That has now been expanded from the National Wind Farm Commissioner to the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner on 26 March 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this review, Mr Dyer has so far held 74 meetings and spoken to some 575 people in remote, rural and regional communities, as well as meeting with stakeholders in cities. From Tamworth to Wangaratta, and to Dubbo, Muswellbrook, Ballarat and Brisbane, Andrew and his team are getting out and talking to people on the ground about these issues. They have received over 500 submissions in over 250 online responses, and will provide a final report which will be made public to the government in December. Much of the ground that we have been talking about late into the evening in these motions and debates are being covered by Mr Dyer. The review will consider community attitudes towards renewable energy infrastructure and provide advice on the best way to maximise community engagement and benefit in planning, developing and operating renewable energy infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conducting the review, the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner should have regard to the following: perceived or actual environmental impacts; perceived or actual impacts on agricultural land, including emergency management and fire and biosecurity risks—things that have been raised with me multiple times; and increases in landholder insurance premiums. We know that this is an issue, and it isn't just an issue with transmission lines. If you talk to farmers around the Pilliga, who are having gas pipelines put across their properties, you hear that they're being told at times, 'You're now uninsurable.' At the same time, Santos's plans, should there be a bushfire in the Pilliga, is to evacuate—to get out of there. And who is going to be left fighting these fires? All the farmers who are part of the Rural Fire Service are going to be the ones who have to turn up and fight these fires. These are the things we have to look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will look at the impacts on tourism, and aesthetic and cultural indications—again, these are things we need to consider. There's community engagement and benefit-sharing, including financial, local infrastructure and knowledge-sharing, and any other type of benefit. The AEIC can advise on how to maximise community engagement within the existing regulatory and legislative frameworks, including the National Electricity Law, the National Energy Objectives and the regulatory investment test for transmission. There's a bunch more, and I have enjoyed engaging with Mr Dyer in his role—I found him to be knowledgeable and very passionate about his work. He certainly turns up at estimates as one of a handful who will give you a straight answer and tell you how it is. He's not hiding anything. So I look forward to seeing what his review recommends, because I acknowledge that this is a concern for communities. It's so critical that we get it right; we have to get this right as a country. And we have to act, knowing just how critical this is and the speed at which we're going to have to get this right to really lead the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I'll just to touch on the politics of this. I would take it far more seriously if the people who raise concerns about things like transmission lines and turbines had in the past raised the same concerns when we saw the fossil fuel industry putting through pipelines and coal seam gas wells. We've seen Mr Dutton weighing into this, but a search of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of the 46th Parliament and also of the 45th Parliament doesn't return any results for Mr Dutton talking about the issue of transmission lines. So I welcome debate on this; I think it's something that needs to be looked into, but I'm very wary of some of the politics in play being used to whip up some of the fear and some of the flat out climate science denial that we've heard from some in this chamber in this debate.</span>

I've actually mentioned this to a number of opposition senators and encouraged them to participate in Mr Dyer's review and encourage concerned communities to participate in Mr Dyer's review. These are exactly the issues that Mr Dyer is looking at with regard to the consultation processes when it comes to renewable energy infrastructure, and I suggest that any opposition senator who is actually sincere in their concerns about this issue would be participating in Mr Dyer's review and would encourage affected and interested communities to do so as well. If opposition senators aren't doing that, that just exposes that they're only pursuing this for their political ends. With that, I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These regulations would increase the capital funding indexation percentage for block grant authorities for non-government schools in 2023, thereby increasing federal funding to capital works for private schools by $21.2 million, up to a total annual sum of $215.7 million. This disallowance would maintain the indexation for capital works for non-government schools at its current rate. This doesn't mean that money is being ripped away from private schools. They would still receive an annual sum of $194 million among numerous other buckets of cash that they have access to. The purpose of this disallowance is simply for the government to prioritise helping our struggling public schools before pouring more money into the private-school system. Furthermore, we note that there are significant concerns around how block grant authorities distribute these resources, with minimal accountability across block grant authorities leading to some poorly funded Catholic schools being stranded in a system that gives lavishly to private schools for more pools and orchestra pits. Recently, in New South Wales it was reported that two private schools had to pay back more than $23 million in government funding because it turned out that they were turning a profit. It is a total farce that our system allows for these types of things to happen, and that the government can have such little oversight of the goings-on of these schools and the block grant authorities that schools can be making a profit. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important as well to really emphasise what money private schools receive. On top of the SRS—and keep in mind that 98 per cent of private schools are overfunded when it comes to the SRS and they get loaded up on a per-student basis—private schools can also add the exorbitant fees that they charge to the money pot. We know that fees have gone up by between 50 per cent and 80 per cent as well as funds such as this one. With the tap never turning off, it's no wonder some school principals decide to indulge in decadent things like plunge pools and new RM Williams uniforms for their students. What's the incentive for them not to? What else does this pot pour into? One of the top Brisbane schools recently flashed its plans to expand with a six-storey building, including an art-science wet space, a library and a dedicated performing arts rehearsal space. </span>

                    </a>  I'm sure these are wonderful spaces in an amazing learning environment. But that's my problem and why I'm here fighting. When did we stop wanting that for all children so that all students around the country are able to learn in and access beautiful spaces that enrich their education and help broaden their interests? Let's compare that with some of the public schools in this country. One public school in Victoria has 61 demountables—I will say that again: 61 demountables. Another in Melbourne's north-east has 49. This means that instead of building infrastructure governments are saddling state schools with temporary demountables and not anything that's long-term, efficient or appropriate, let alone beautiful and lovely to be in. This means for these students there is no permanent six-storey heritage building with different build-outs. No, instead, they have demountables that get unbearably hot in summer and unbearably cold in winter. I can tell you, having taught in several classrooms like that in Queensland throughout my public school teaching career, that I can confirm that they are absolutely not conducive to young people maximising their learning. I taught in classrooms on the cape that flood every time it rains, and I've taught in classrooms riddled with asbestos that have to be cleared every time there is a bump or a knock on the wall that means they're unsafe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can we accept this? How can we ask parent and students to accept this? That is why this motion is so important. It is so critical for us to not shy away from the fights and stickiness in these debates. I'm here because I believe the fight we must be having and that Labor must be having is looking at why some schools can lavish such excess on their students, and why others—kids in public schools—are forced to struggle for the minimum. When did this become the Australian norm? It's completely obvious by now that the system is rigged. The mirage of choice that was pioneered by the Howard and the Gillard governments and other coalition governments has completely poisoned the well of egalitarian schooling in Australia. No longer is it about choice. The true choice is whether or not your parents have the financial choice to send you to a private or a public school. The biggest determinant of how well a young person does in the education system in this country is their parents' bank balance. And that's a fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of expanding and exploring what our public system could be and the ways that it could be shaped differently, we've just ripped that up and we're only dishing out the good stuff to the kids whose families can afford it. This is setting us up to lock an immovable type of inequality into our education system. Instead of broadening the horizons about what we can achieve in our public system, private schools are becoming reliant on the millions and millions of dollars of public money that they expect to receive to keep the wheels turning. While public schools around this country fight for basic amenities, the government continues to pour money into the private sector. We know that public school funding in Australia is well below the OECD average. When do we call this a crisis? Underfunding means one teacher for dozens of kids. It means kids not getting the support that they need. Eighty-five per cent of young people in this country with additional needs are in public schools. It means broken laptops—if you're lucky enough to have them—and out-of-date textbooks, and it is teachers and parents who are making up the shortfall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, underfunding means kids slipping through the cracks. If we're going to keep wringing our hands about the outcomes of our students and how they continue to fall, then we need to fund our public schools to the bare minimum. Not funding our public schools to 100 per cent of the SRS means failing. It means not setting those kids up for success, and it means widening inequality in this country. That's why I moved this disallowance, and that's why I ask that the Senate support this motion and that the government work with us to ensure that public schools are not falling down around students' heads or riddled with asbestos or leaking or flooding before giving even more money to private schools.</span>

At the outset, I want to place on the record that I deeply respect Senator Allman-Payne's commitment to education during her career and have no doubt that the students who had the privilege of being in her class benefited from her commitment to education. I put that on the record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have an ideological obsession against anything which is in the private sector. It doesn't matter what it is, whether it is private health insurance or non-government schools; the Greens have an ideological obsession against it. They have an ideological obsession against private education, against private health insurance, against the private sector, and a complete lack of understanding that Australia has benefited—greatly benefited—from the fact that we have both a public and private education sphere and a public and private health insurance sector. We have greatly, greatly benefited from that balance between the public and the private sectors. But, again and again, they come into this place with their ideological, philosophical obsessions against what has worked well in practice in terms of providing the optimum outcomes for the optimum number of Australians. And this is just another example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me put on the record: I am very happy the Greens have moved this motion because it will provide me an opportunity between now and the next federal election to advise all those families in the Green-held seats of Ryan, Brisbane and Griffith in South-East Queensland that the Greens despise the fact that they save and scrimp and do everything they possibly can to provide their children with the best educational outcomes that they perceive should be provided to them. I'll provide those parents with every single opportunity to understand that the Greens oppose their right to send their children to a non-government school. I'll make sure I remind them from this day to the next election. They oppose private health insurance and they oppose non-government education in non-government-owned schools, and I'll be reminding those families in those Green held seats in the south-east corner of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I want to make in relation to this disallowance motion is that it shows a complete misunderstanding of what is happening with capital construction costs. Capital construction costs have absolutely gone through the roof across this whole country, so the capital cost of building a new school building or facility to enhance the capital services and the environment for students going to non-government schools has gone through the roof. That is the reality, and those sitting on the other side of the chamber are absolutely part of the reason for that, because they took the only handbrake off the CFMMEU construction division. That handbrake was the Australian Building and Construction Commission. So now the CFMMEU is there running just about every single construction site at every single school just about across the whole of Australia, and you can add 30 per cent to the capital cost of constructing any public infrastructure. That is the whole reason why the government had to institute the so-called 90-day review of infrastructure projects, which has blown out by a further 100 days. It's because construction costs in this country have absolutely gone through the roof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's call out this disallowance motion for what it is. It is an expression of the ideological contempt that the Greens political party has for non-government-owned schools. It's their ideological obsession—one of many—against anything in the private sector. They do not respect the sacrifices made by Australian parents to send their children to schools of their choice. Whether it be a religious institution providing a religious based education or any other sort of school in the non-government sector, that is simply not respected by the Australian Greens. So, between now and the next federal election, I look forward to reminding people living in the Queensland federal seats of Ryan, Brisbane and Griffith, including parents who are saving to send their children to non-government schools in those seats—there are many great secondary schools and primary schools in the non-government sector in those three Greens seats—that the Greens have an ideological obsession against the manifestation of their choice to send their children to a school of their choosing. I'll be looking forward to reminding people, including parents, of that fact between now and the next federal election.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  The government will be opposing this disallowance motion. The Capital Grants Program provides funding for non-government schools to improve capital infrastructure where they otherwise may not have access to sufficient capital resources. This program has had long-term bipartisan support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Capital Grants Program funding is allocated to schools according to identified student need. Indexation of that funding ensures that the value of the capital program is maintained over time. The Australian government is committed to working with the states and territories to get every school to 100 per cent of its fair funding level, and that remains the case. We are obviously strong supporters of public education, and I say that as someone who was educated in public education. We want to see every school get to 100 per cent of its fair funding level, but we need to recognise the choice that many parents make, as is their right, to have their kids educated in a non-government school, and that is one of the reasons for our support for this Capital Grants Program.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've committed $275.2 million over two years under the Schools Upgrade Fund, and we've already delivered $50 million, under round 1, to more than 1,300 schools. They are schools like Indooroopilly State School in the electorate of Ryan, held by a Greens MP, which received $25,000 for shade structures, and St Joseph's, again in the electorate of Ryan, which received $25,000 for repairs and facility maintenance. If we look at Griffith, also held by a Greens MP, we see that St Martin's and St Laurence's College have received funding through this program. St Martin's received $6,000 for air purification and St Laurence's received $25,000 for a shade structure. Round 2 of the Schools Upgrade Fund is providing $215.8 million for government schools to invest in new facilities, major refurbishments and other capital upgrades. Expressions of interest are now open, and I encourage public schools from across the country to apply to participate. This is the same amount of capital funding as we've provided to non-government schools in 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be very clear that this disallowance motion from the Greens would have the effect of stripping funding from Catholic schools in Greens-held electorates—schools like St Martin's and St Laurence's in the Greens-held electorate of Griffith and St Joseph's in the Greens-held electorate of Ryan. I'm sure there are many other similar examples in the Greens-held electorate of Brisbane. I wonder whether those Greens MPs—Mr Bates, Mr Chandler-Mather and Ms Watson-Brown—are being honest with their constituents, many of whom decided to vote Greens. I wonder if those Greens MPs are being honest about their agenda to strip funding from Catholic schools like the ones I've just mentioned. I think the Greens owe it to their constituents to be honest about their plans to strip capital funding from those schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing in what we are putting forward is about taking money away from public schools. Labor governments have always been strong supporters of funding for public education, and I say that as someone who's personally committed to public education. But we do recognise that many parents have good reasons for choosing non-government schooling for their kids. Those schools should not be subject to ideological campaigns by the Greens that seek to remove that funding. I challenge Mr Chandler-Mather, Mr Bates and Ms Watson-Brown to go and face those schools and talk to them about their plans to strip the schools' capital funding because of the Greens' ideological beliefs. That's why we will be opposing this disallowance motion.</span>

Capital funding under the Australian Education Act is provided to block grant authorities, something that's been happening since 2014. Those authorities disperse money to either Catholic schools or independent schools, but the umbrella of independent schools doesn't just cover private schools for wealthy families. It includes independent schools, special assistance schools and schools for Indigenous students. In Tassie, these include Giant Steps Tasmania, an independent special school in Deloraine for children on the autism spectrum. There are also indie schools in Burnie, Devonport and Glenorchy. Indie schools are alternative kinds of schools for kids who don't learn best in traditional learning environments. They fill a really important gap in our education system, and I think they're amazing. I wish my son had had a chance to go to an indie school program when he was in high school.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get what the Greens are trying to do here. They're trying to make sure private schools with rich kids aren't better off than public schools. It's something I agree with; education should be as equitable as possible. But this isn't the way to do it, I'm sorry. This would also punish those schools that are applying for grants to look after the most vulnerable kids in the community, the kids that require special care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem I have with the grants is that, for the last four years at least, Giant Steps Tasmania and the special assistance schools that help our most vulnerable students have not received any of this funding. Maybe they didn't apply. If they didn't, my message to them would be to give it a go. I don't think cashed-up private schools need to be given more taxpayer money, but I don't think we should deny independent schools like Giant Steps Tasmania the chance to get a piece of the pie either. That's why I won't be supporting this disallowance motion.</span>

I'm interested in the government's view on carbon dioxide emissions that are shipped to another country for undersea storage. I'm guessing the view of the government is that they are then off Australia's books, but what happens if some of those CO2 emissions then escape or are let out and the whole amount isn't delivered? On whose books is that reflected, or is it, because it's in the ocean, 'play on'?</span>

I think, Senator Pocock, the answer to your question is that it depends. We are passing a piece of legislation here that sets up, really, the framework by which an agreement might be made with another country to allow transborder movement of carbon dioxide.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation requires us to observe the London protocol, and the London protocol requires us to have a bilateral agreement in place between those two countries before any permit could be granted. So the details and the status of those agreements or arrangements would be decided between the exporting and receiving countries on a case-by-case basis. It would address matters that would include, but not be limited to, responsibility for maintaining the sequestered carbon dioxide and any emissions, the ability of countries to accurately monitor emissions and any leakage from transport or storage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the specific question I think you're asking about how carbon accounting would occur, any release of carbon dioxide throughout the capture, transport, injection and storage phase would need to be accounted for under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change international emissions reporting frameworks, and they would be included in the national emissions inventory of the country in which they occur.</span>

We saw what happened with the 2009 Montara oil and gas spill. We saw the harm caused to not only our coastline and marine environment but also those of our neighbours in Indonesia, and we saw the subsequent class action—an international claim against Australia for transboundary harm. Surely this legislation opens up the door for those sorts of risks? Has that assessment been undertaken by either of the departments that are working on this bill?</span>

There are at least two important decisions that would need to be taken before any export was permitted. The first is that a bilateral agreement of some kind would need to be established between Australia and a country to which an export might take place. The second thing would be to then assess an application for a permit under the protocol for such an export. In assessing a permit, the department would utilise the London protocol assessment framework. The environmental impact assessment must include but is not limited to a long-term management plan, a geological assessment and marine characterisation of the disposal site, an impact and risk assessment, a mitigation and remediation plan, a description of potential impacts on any matters of national environmental significance, a waste prevention audit, waste management options, chemical and physical properties of the carbon dioxide, an assessment of potential effects, and monitoring and risk management. So, Senator Pocock, you are right to point to the possibility of risks arising. That's why this framework matters, because it puts in place the legislative basis that would allow Australia to assess a project of this kind in a way that is consistent with the international agreement. </span>

The government is telling us we need this to better regulate so we can enter into bilateral agreements and uphold the highest standards of all sorts of details to be worked out down the track, with a 'she will be right, trust us' attitude. We have the opposition, who have basically checked out on this; they're not acting like an opposition when it comes to this bill. They are usually concerned about seeing details, knowing about consultation. We heard earlier the minister can't tell us who she met with in the last three months on this bill. It seems like there's been no meaningful engagement on it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening in the Senate on this bill is, frankly, an insult to Australians. The major parties are on a unity ticket when it comes to facilitating the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. We will hear the government argue against it, that it is not what is happening with these emerging technologies we need to regulate well. Yet there are amendments from the crossbench that say, 'If that is the case, we will take you on your word.' Rule out facilitating the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. We will hear the government argue against it and say, 'No, that is not what is happening. We have all these emerging technologies that we really need to regulate well.' We have amendments from the cross bench that say, 'Okay, if that is the case, we will take you on your word. Rule out facilitating the expansion of the fossil fuel industry.' But no, we can't do that. We couldn't possibly compromise Santos or Woodside. You have to ask the question: what is happening in Australia in 2023 when we have the major parties acting like this? Minister, given the Labor Party doesn't take donations from big tobacco because of the harm on communities, on society, why do you still take donations from fossil fuel companies? </span>

Earlier in the day, you made a series of propositions about the ruinous nature of this legislation. I explained to you at that time that the government considers that the transition to net zero is a challenging one that will require all of the tools available to us in order to minimise emissions of carbon dioxide and equivalent into the atmosphere. That is confirmed by all of the authoritative international information we have about credible pathways to net zero, including the International Energy Agency's assessments and other similar assessments.</span>

Last year the government took a series of budget decisions to divert subsidies that had been directed towards commercial-scale carbon capture and storage by the previous government towards other government priorities. These are projects that will need to make commercial sense for the proponents. In the event that a proponent decides that the permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide and the costs associated with that make sense in the context of their project, it is important that there be a regulatory framework in place to manage that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  I rise this evening to put on the record some remarks in relation to the very sad conflict in the Middle East and some of the effects it is having on our community in Australia and most particularly in my state of New South Wales. It was a month ago that we woke to the dreadful images of Hamas attacking Israel, murdering innocent civilians and then kidnapping hundreds of Israelis. This has had a profound impact on the community in Australia more broadly, but it has a particular impact on the Jewish community and also, of course, on the Muslim community in Sydney and elsewhere in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The position that Australia has taken has been the right position: to support Israel in fighting Hamas. But I understand that there has been a very significant level of hurt in how this debate has played out and that there have been instances which could have been managed better in terms of the communication of how this undertaking will be progressed. We're talking about human life here, and there has been much suffering on both sides of the conflict in Gaza. Australia's position should always be to condemn all forms of terrorism and to condemn the loss of civilian life, because, of course, we are committed as a responsible global citizen to ultimately getting to a two state solution with Israel and Palestine. I believe that the statement that the former prime ministers made—which set out their very clear position of understanding and support for the Jewish community, which feels under great stress at the moment—was timely and very well expressed. That statement also was very deliberate in that it made mention of the very strong feelings that I know that many parts of the Sydney Muslim community have about the impact and the treatment of Palestinian people at this time, because, of course, as Australians, we care about all citizens and we value the life of an Israeli child in exactly the same way that we regard the value of the life of a Palestinian child. That is why we are committed to a two state solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a shocking outbreak of Islamophobia and antisemitism in this debate, and this is a time for leadership. It is a time for all our leaders to try and bring our different groups together, because here in Australia we are the most successful multicultural society on Earth, and at the moment it feels like that is fraying. Our leaders need to make a much stronger effort to bring different groups together and to speak out when wrongs happen. I feel that, with the recent outbreak of antisemitism in Sydney, where you've seen Hitler and Netanyahu faces and you've seen swastikas inscribed on various pieces of public infrastructure, that needs to be investigated and people need to be prosecuted under the laws of the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, political leaders have to be very careful about how they engage in this debate. The Greens political party released a statement which depicted Israel as no longer existing. It is just so important that we take a moment to reflect on the humanity here, that we take all steps that we can to engage carefully with all parts of our community, because Australia is balanced and must always be a balanced country. We must look after all of our communities. We are supportive of the Palestinian people. We are supportive of the Israeli people. We support Israel. We do not support Hamas. We must always commit ourselves to working as a collaborative international citizen towards the long-held goal of a two-state solution. That is really important, and we need to give people hope that that is still something that we believe is achievable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281558" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  In the inherent chaos of an emergency, there is one constant, reassuring presence that we can all rely on: the state emergency services. The volunteers who give up their time to respond to emergencies as members of the SES are often the first point of contact many people have when engulfed in the crisis unfolding around them. They are the first responders who help you fix your roof when storms rip the tiles from your house. They are often the first people you see in the aftermath of a car crash or supporting firefighters during an emergency evacuation. The SES are often the unsung heroes of an emergency: the traffic controllers and the sandbaggers. However, in regional communities, like much of my home state of Tasmania, they can be so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living in regional areas means the SES are often the first responders. They are trained in emergency response and often the first on the scene of so many critical incidents. Being a first responder in a small community carries its own set of mental risks, like the fear that you may know the person who is injured or whose house is in the direct line of a bushfire, which is why people who volunteer for the SES in small communities deserve recognition for the volunteer work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, the Northern Midlands SES Unit, based in northern Tasmania, recently awarded six new life memberships of their organisation, and I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight their achievements and commitment to their communities. David Oakely, 82, is one of the founding members of the Northern Midlands SES Unit and is still an active member 37 years on. He said he remembers vividly the first time he was called upon to use the jaws of life to cut open a car that had crashed in the region. At that time, the jaws functioned like the pump on a blow-up mattress, and David remembers the urgency as he pumped the jaws to try to cut through the car and save the boy trapped in the back seat. But David's achievements didn't stop there. He and two other members who also received life membership, Graeme McGee and Bevis Perkins, successfully lobbied the Tasmanian government of the day to separate road rescue services from Ambulance Tasmania, making a positive impact to the services. The trio formed the Campbelltown SES and remained active members of the SES community. Graeme has served 25 years with the Northern Midlands SES, and Bevis served 27 years before he died in 2012.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While its important to celebrate their frontline work, I think it's equally important to celebrate the people who've been committed to the organisation's functioning—people like Hamish Wellard and Rob Thomas. The pair have given to the SES 17 and 15 years respectively, and both were awarded life memberships for their commitment to the growth of the SES unit. Hamish lives only 50 metres from the SES shed, so he's often the first to arrive. Hamish was also integral in building the minitruck mascot used for fundraising. Similarly, Rob secured a government grant to extend the shed facilities, both adding great value to their SES facilities. These examples are the type of work SES volunteers do every day without payment or recognition. They do it because it's the right thing to do for their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have focused on the Northern Midlands SES Unit today, I want to acknowledge the work done by all SES volunteers across Tasmania and the country. We should always remember the contribution SES volunteers make to our communities and how important they are to emergency management. Without them, the hard work of the first responders, firefighters, police and ambulance would be hugely diminished. Thank you to David, Graeme, Rob, Peter, Hamish and Bevis. But, more broadly, thank you to all SES volunteers across Australia. We can never repay you for the hard work and kindness you show to all of us who find ourselves in an emergency.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Today marks one year since Senator Cash declared that the government's secure jobs, better pay legislation would close down Australia. It's been 12 months, and I'm proud to say that Australia is well and truly still open. The sun is still coming up. The sky hasn't fallen in. In fact, unemployment is at historic lows. There have been over half a million jobs created since the Albanese Labor government was elected. This is the most jobs created in the first term of any government on record, and we're only 18 months in. Under Labor, wages are growing at their highest rate in over 10 years, and we inherited an industrial relations system that was broken, outdated and based on an economy that just doesn't exist anymore. It was a system that didn't deliver for employers or employees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Senator Cash predicted that this legislation would send Australia back to the 1970s. Well, we haven't time travelled, despite the best efforts of those opposite to actually send us back not to the 1970s but to the 1950s while they were in office! In fact, we are putting Australian women at the heart of our jobs plan and at the heart of our economic plan. When the secure jobs, better pay legislation passed the parliament, it put respect for women workers at the heart of our workplace laws, after a decade of low wages as a deliberate design feature of the economic policy of the previous government. There was a race to the bottom on wages and conditions across some of our most essential sectors, like our care economy, which faces unprecedented workforce shortages, with dedicated, highly skilled early childhood educators having left the sector because they simply couldn't afford to stay. It was educators who stood up for these important laws and told their stories to us here in parliament about how much they love their work and how hard it is to continue, because, as we all know, love just doesn't pay the rent. This is a sector that is dominated by women. The secure jobs, better pay legislation paved the way for multi-employer bargaining, which is now being used by educators to take their case to the Fair Work Commission. They are standing up for the professional wages that they deserve—wages that truly reflect the value of their work in educating future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is a step towards closing the gender pay gap in this country—a gap that is still at 13 per cent for millions of working women. I will note that this legislation and our policies for economic equality have brought this down from nearly 19 per cent under the previous government. But that should come as no surprise, because of course you would struggle to think of a single policy for women from the previous government. Upgrading highways to help make sure women get to hospital in time to give birth was, apparently, one of their best economic policies for women. They were proposing to deal with family violence by letting women raid their own super to get out of abusive relationships. They were telling women protesting about sexual violence that they were lucky not to be shot. They had a previous leader who could only understand sexual assault as 'a father of daughters'. This is what you'd expect from a party that has only gone backwards on representation for women in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we're not only investing in Australian women; we are a government of women. I am incredibly proud to be a part of the first Australian majority-women government. We are 55 out of 104 caucus members. We know that governments make better decisions when they better reflect the communities they serve, and we are delivering for Australian women. That's why we've funded a much-needed 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, who are mainly women. We're supporting workforce participation with a historic expansion of paid parental leave and by making early childhood education free for the vast majority of families. We will continue to stand up for the working women of this nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator TYRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Jacqui Lambie Network Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  One of the good things to come out of COVID was telehealth. Telehealth has been a game changer for Tasmanians. You used to hear stories about people driving hours to get an appointment, meaning they had to miss a day or so of work—not to mention getting on a plane and travelling to Melbourne or Sydney with a sick kid just for a one-hour doctor's appointment. Now people can talk to specialists from the comfort of their home, and get a treatment plan carried out by doctors in Tassie. It costs an arm and a leg to see a specialist, but you can usually count on the Medicare rebate to take the sting out of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That could be about to change. The Medicare Benefits Schedule Review Advisory Committee recently recommended axing Medicare rebates for initial consults with a specialist via telehealth. If it's a specialist you've seen before, that's fine; but if it's the first time you're seeing a specialist, the committee is saying you shouldn't get a rebate. This doesn't just apply to a cardiologist or an orthopaedic surgeon; it applies to an appointment with a psychiatrist too. Getting rid of these Medicare rebates will disproportionately affect Tasmanians. People in inner-city Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra with access to specialists will be fine, but Tasmanians don't have the same access to health care that mainlanders do. In Tasmania you can be waiting months or years for an appointment with a specialist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Tasmanians were twice as likely as their mainland counterparts to claim the Medicare rebate for an initial psychiatry appointment via telehealth. We rely on telehealth to see a psychiatrist more than people in any other state or territory. The majority of people who need it most are young, and most are young women. One of my constituents was in this boat. She needed an appointment with a psychiatrist for a potential medical diagnosis. She was initially referred to a psychiatrist in Tasmania but was told there was a 12-month waiting list. She got a second referral to access a psychiatrist on the mainland via telehealth and had an appointment—and, importantly, a diagnosis—within three weeks. A Tassie girl can't get an appointment at home but she can get one in Sydney via telehealth. That's sad. But here's the kicker: the telehealth appointment had cost the young woman almost $1,000 up-front. She got just under half of that back from Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For most people in Tassie, paying that kind of money up-front is unthinkable. Some people are never going to be able to pay that—they just won't go to the appointment. Some people might be able to borrow a few hundred dollars here or there, knowing they can pay the money back once the rebate comes in. But these people now face a difficult choice of paying a grand to get an appointment in three weeks, with no rebate, or waiting 12 months to see a specialist in Tassie and get some of that cash back. I think that's bloody wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the time you go to a specialist you're already in the thick of it. You need help and you need it quickly. If we get rid of Medicare rebates for these initial telehealth consults then we're telling people that you can only get immediate help if you can afford it. If you can stump up a grand to see someone in three weeks, great. If you can't, you sit on the waiting list for a face-to-face appointment and hope that nothing bad happens in that time. Access to health care shouldn't depend on your bank account balance. The fact that it costs a grand to see a specialist is a whole other problem that I'm not even going to get into today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting rid of Medicare rebates for initial appointments via telehealth will put help even further out of reach for everyday Tasmanians. Right now this is just a recommendation and it's not set in stone. I get that not everything can be done on telehealth. If you've got a weird rash on your arm, it's a bit hard for a doctor to see what's going on through a bad internet connection. But we're not talking about weird rashes. We're talking about things like psychiatrist appointments for acute mental health problems. If you're depressed, or even suicidal, and you summon the energy to book an appointment with someone that can help, that's something we should be patting you on the back for. But if you're in Tasmania and you're told to wait 12 months, that's a lifetime away and that could be a death sentence. Don't make that harder. Don't make it further out of reach. The ones who need it the most are the ones who can afford it the least. They deserve help as much as any wealthy Sydneysider does.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia by geographical favour is an island nation and is naturally positioned to be a great trading country. We carry over 99 per cent of our traded goods by sea, which makes shipping an essential piece in our 24/7 economy, and our ports are a central gateway to that economy. Every day at ports across our country, ships arrive at our terminals, picking up our mighty export product that the wealth of our country is built upon. Those ships take those products to ports in places across the world. On the other hand, goods such as medical supplies, clothes, food, retail products and building materials arrive on our shore through our ports. Trucks and trains then carry the baton of the great freight task, transporting goods from ports to every corner of our vast country. Without shipping and ports, Australia stops. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right throughout the country cost-of-living pressures are straining family budgets and hurting businesses. In the context of economic headwinds like these, even the smallest of economic shocks have a ripple effect. This is exactly what is happening at ports in Fremantle, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane right now as industrial action has stalled the movement of goods at DP World terminals. Thanks to the pro-union agenda of the Albanese Labor government, the CFMMEU have been able to hold our critical supply chains to ransom for over a month now, causing ships to sit dormant off our coastline. Processing delays have blown out from the usual two days to over eight days, a 300 per cent increase. This compounds even more for a ship that travels from Brisbane to Sydney to Melbourne and then on to Fremantle, which means an extra 24 days of delays. The economic impact of this is significant, and modelling indicates it is taking an economic hit of $201 million per day—over $200 million a day. Ultimately, the cost trickles all the way from the shipping liner to the Australian consumer, as businesses are forced to pay this cost and to pass that cost on to everyday Australian consumers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the CFMMEU stubbornly refuses to come back to the negotiations. The union shows no signs of letting up in the lead-up to Christmas. Just this week the CFMMEU have indicated that they will continue to strike until 20 November. As the holiday season approaches, buyer will begin to notice their purchases won't be showing up on time. Retailer will be low on stock, summer renovators will be short on building materials and businesses will bear the brunt at the busiest time of the year. There will be delays in the trade market across a raft of portfolio areas of this Albanese government, and it seems that Christmas 2023 will be no exception. This is the environment that the Albanese government have created with their pro-union agenda. Unions like the CFMMEU, the MUA and the ACTU feel emboldened by a weak government that facilitates their demands and that bows to their pressures. The government feels the need to repay union favours, and, as a consequence, unions can run rampant on our docks and right through our domestic supply chain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rolling strikes at our ports are a worrying sign of things to come, and the introduction of multi-employer bargaining will be very, very bad news for Australia's supply chain. At a time of economic hardship and stubborn inflation, the government should be working in the interests of everyday Australians who've had to bear the brunt of another mortgage increase that was announced today and make our ports more productive, reliable and efficient. But under the Albanese Labor government all we see is delay, and that is costing the Australian consumer every day. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I rise to speak to the millions of Australians who have been hit with yet another interest rate rise today—No. 12 since Labor was elected. If you have a $750,000 mortgage, you're now paying an extra $24,000 per year, and the Reserve Bank has warned of even more rises to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia today has higher inflation than nearly every major advanced economy in the world, and there's no light at the end of this dark tunnel because Labor has no plan to fight inflation and rising interest rates. The fact is that Labor's rubbish short-term vote-buying, Labor's record immigration and Labor's suicidal rush to net zero are directly responsible for this inflation and the pain it's causing the Australian people. Labor has increased government spending by almost $200 billion. About $20 billion of this was cost-of-living relief that has pretty much already been overtaken by inflation. It included some of the biggest rises in pensions and unemployment benefits we have ever seen. Billions more have gone to child care, Medicare, rent assistance and an increased single parenting payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians struggling with the cost of living would, understandably, accept these handouts, with Labor banking their votes for the next election. It is vote-buying, plain and simple. It's also robbing Peter to pay Paul. This short-term relief will mean greater pain in the long term. That $200 billion of additional spending has to come from somewhere; spending has to be cut in other areas, or taxes have to go up—or the money must be borrowed. Labor loves to borrow: our gross federal debt is approaching a trillion dollars. It just goes up, and up and up while Labor and the coalition refuse to do the hard work to pay down the debt. Soon we'll be paying more than $32 billion a year in interest on this debt. That's $32 billion that won't be put towards a single road, school or hospital. It will just go to creditors, like central banks. Ultimately, every Australian for generations will pay for it with higher taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have the new productivity commissioner and the International Monetary Fund calling for an increase in the GST, which will make virtually all goods and services in Australia cost more—effectively by another five per cent or more. And that's on top of rising inflation. I don't know the economists who are advising the Prime Minister, but, as I said in my maiden speech in the other place, all those years ago, I wouldn't even let one of them handle my grocery shopping! Other economists are warning increasingly of the growing danger posed by Labor's record immigration. It is driving more inflation, suppressing wage growth and, of course, making our housing and rental crisis much worse than they should be or need be. We don't have enough homes for the people who are already here, and Labor plans to bring another 1.5 million people here in the next two to three years. This is making rentals unaffordable, even for people on comfortable incomes, and the latest interest-rate rise will drive them up further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Labor—with the Greens tail wagging the government dog—is rushing ahead with unrealistic renewables targets and emissions reductions. This is the art of chasing the votes of more impressionable and younger Australians who have been indoctrinated into the climate change cult, believing that the planet is doomed unless Australia reduces its one per cent share of global emissions. Both parties of government do this; they sacrifice much-needed long-term reform for short-term political gain. They're basically incapable of thinking and planning beyond the next election. It is unsustainable and it can't go on. But it will go on as long as Australians keep on voting for these clowns, based on handouts and transitory issues that, ultimately, do not contribute to building a prosperous nation and a strong economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Your Prime Minister is certainly aware of this, but I tell you that he doesn't care. That's evidenced by the way he has run this country since his election. When his time in the job is over he will get a golden parachute and a staffed office for life. But that's okay—Australians, you will keep struggling.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:59</span>):  In my community of Boorloo Perth there is an arts scene that has given Australia some of the most exciting artists of the last few decades. Just north of the CBD is the Pickle District, a thriving arts hub that houses co-working spaces, photography studios, art galleries and design studios all benefiting from being very short distances from each other and adding to the character of the area. The Pickle District is a place that encourages raw community growth and collective action. The district is unique as a neighbourhood of innovative and imaginative minds with a common vision to enable the arts industry to thrive. It leads and creates places of activation and development through engaging, organising and empowering local residents and businesses to continue exploring our industrial and open nature to find a way to create a more sustainable, diverse and inclusive place to live, work and play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our arts community is always worth protecting and in Perth it is no different. We are already seeing the signs that the interests of big business and developers might be put ahead of protecting the very thing that makes our city and this space so unique. Last year plans were announced for a $25 million development that will see among other things a new Bunnings go into the district. It does not seem to matter to the proponents that there are two other Bunnings in very close proximity to the location already. This is part of a wider trend across the area, where we are seeing greenfield developments that help big businesses but don't work for the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, the Greens have knocked on thousands of doors across Perth and the things that the community have shared with us are very clear. They are goals which our Greens movement are wonderfully aligned with. They have shared with us the need and their desire to see affordable and accessible housing, and real solutions to the rental crisis that that community and so many others are experiencing. They want us to protect, support and grow our arts community, not push it out so something like a Bunnings can get yet another location in the inner city. And they want real action on climate change because our city is at the forefront of an even greater accelerating climate crisis than we have ever seen before. We are seeing bushfires put homes and lives in danger across Perth's south-eastern suburbs, and the sight of the city covered in smoke has become, quite frankly, far too common.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Australia is a beautiful place and Perth is the most exciting city in the country. I am sure not a single person in this place would disagree with me on that statement. It deserves representation that shares its community vision, not just the vision of those obsessed with maintaining a status quo. I am thrilled to be able to say that it now has that representation because the Greens working together with the community have enabled the election of the first-ever openly Greens councillor for the City of Vincent, the first Greens councillor in the history of state of Western Australia. This milestone has been reached because the community are sick and tired of their needs and their priorities being swamped by the needs of big businesses that have bought favour with the major parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our arts sector is just one example of a community being massively underserved by the current government. The Greens want to see increased funding for local art and to protect places like the Pickle District that make our state so special. I want to congratulate Sophie Greer and the campaign team that took on the vested political interests of WA's local government structures and elected a transparently Green member of parliament for the first time in the history of this state, bringing transparency and accountability to our local government system. Well done to all of you. It is an incredible achievement. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  In our First Nations acknowledgement of country, we often hear reference to emerging leaders. Last week, people came together across the Groote Eylandt archipelago and the Northern Territory to farewell a man who was actively transitioning from emerging leader to senior spokesperson and leader for his people. His family have given consent for us to refer to him as Mr T Amagula, a well-known name to many Territorians and increasingly more Australians. Mr Amagula was a youthful 52 years of age, with his influence and leadership steadily building as deputy chair of the Anindilyakwa Land Council. Prior to this, Mr Amagula had already established a reputation as an energetic, thoughtful and well-grounded man of his people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Amagula established an early reputation for leadership through his work with the Dhimurru Corporation, a trendsetting group of rangers working in North-East Arnhem Land. He then built on that experience to help establish the acclaimed Anindilyakwa Land &amp; Sea Rangers program on Groote Eylandt. He had a passion for workplace development and developing pathways to Indigenous employment through his work with the Gumatj Gulkula Regional Training Centre in Gove and later as the workforce development officer for the Anindilyakwa Land Council. Mr Amagula was also very involved in cultural heritage issues, a key negotiator for the repatriation of ancestral remains from Washington and the Czech Republic. He carried out that work with solemn responsibility on behalf of the Anindilyakwa people, work that was greatly appreciated by families on Groote Eylandt. Mr Amagula also served on the board of the Groote Eylandt Aboriginal Trust, on the board of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority and as the deputy chair of Miwatj Health in North-East Arnhem Land. Most recently, he also joined the board of the newly established Aboriginal Sea Company Ltd and Northern Territory Aboriginal Investment Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At home, he was actively involved in the local decision-making group, establishing agreements with government across a range of issues affecting his home communities. This included establishment of a new Anindilyakwa local government authority and a new approach to school based education on Groote Eylandt. Mr Amagula was passionate about youth development and juvenile diversion programs, and he was a key contributor to successful youth programs reducing repeat offending and incarceration of Groote Eylandt's young people. The Groote Eylandt community has seen crime levels decrease from 346 offences, recorded in 2018-19, to 17 offences, recorded by local police in 2021-22. It is people and leaders like Mr Amagula who are showing a different way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to give special recognition to him and to his family for his outstanding work on the Voice referendum and on the engagement group that assisted to give advice to our government on the best ways forward that he could see, using from his own examples with his families and kinship groups in the Groote Archipelago. This was important work for him and an opportunity for him to work closely with First Nations leaders from across the country on crafting the question for the referendum. Many Territorians are deeply mourning his loss. I certainly am one of them, and I pass on my deepest condolences to all his friends and families. I'd just reach out and say to them: thank you so much for the love of Mr T Amagula. Thank you for all of the people who worked to try to achieve a better way of life, not only for his own family and kinship group but for Territorians, and to give that advice at the highest of levels, to try to encourage us to find a better way and to do so in a way that would keep people together and bring people together in creating a better place in Australia. I'm deeply saddened to hear of your loss, and I pay my respects to the Groote Eylandt people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  Money is in short supply, and that is no more the case anywhere than with taxpayers' money, which is a finite resource, and I think we have to respect that. Much of the debate in this place and the other place focuses on how little of it there is to meet the demands of government. Tonight, that's why I'm speaking about an issue that a number of Tasmanians have contacted me about, and it's an issue that I believe does warrant further scrutiny. I'm going to be speaking about the Tasmanian Community Fund, or the TCF as it's abbreviated to, which is an entity that was set up by the Tasmanian government following the sale of the state owned bank in Tasmania, the Trust Bank, in 1999.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Using the proceeds of the sale of the bank and an annual appropriation of around $7 million from the Tasmanian government in their annual budget—and following an application process that usually means projects miss out because of, again, that finite resource, the money available to the TCF—the TCF board chooses projects to fund. Many of them are worthy. These projects, as is convention, are community based ones, ones that come from grassroots organisations where Tasmanians can see real benefits, tangible benefits, on the ground in their communities. Previous examples of some of the very good projects that have been funded by the TCF—and there have been many good ones funded by the good people who are members of its board—are $140,000 to the Launceston Women's Shelter; $300,000 towards the Queenstown squash courts, which is a much-needed facility in that remote community; and $6,800 for the Kingborough Community Missions emergency food relief efforts. All of them were very worthy projects and ones that I applaud the board for funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fund and the board that manage it are governed by an act, the TCF Act. In that act, section 7(5) states:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) act honestly in all matters concerning the Fund; and—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">importantly—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) ensure that its functions and powers are performed and exercised in the best interests of the Tasmanian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise that: in the best interests of the Tasmanian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, having read that piece of legislation, I was astounded to hear that the Tasmanian Community Fund board had made a donation from these taxpayers' funds, $7 million annually, to Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition Ltd, an affiliate of the Yes23 campaign. I hence wrote to the TCF board, on 21 September, seeking some details. I was asking two questions in particular. The first question was: how much was this contribution? Because it wasn't disclosed on any of their websites or social media publications. The second question I asked was: did the Yes23 campaign or its affiliates go through the same application process as Tasmanian proponents of their community and grassroots projects? The chair of the board did write back to me on 26 September in a two-page letter, and the chair did disclose that the contribution that was made to the Yes23 campaign was a whopping $557,800—one of the biggest in their history. But the chair didn't disclose to me whether this application had been put through the same process as any other grassroots application from Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanians are rightly outraged at a contribution to one side of a divisive campaign that was made with taxpayers' money meant for community good on the ground to help communities in Tasmania. I can assure you, Acting Deputy President Pratt, that if the funding had gone to the 'no' campaign I'd be asking the same questions. This money is meant for Tasmanians, for good Tasmanian projects. This is not where the money has gone. I don't think any reasonable Tasmanian wanted to see a contribution made to either side of a political campaign, whether it was in support of the 'yes' or the 'no' campaign. The TCF's board's approach to funding allocation makes me question the decision-making process that's been followed here in how they allocate funding. How could the board make this massive contribution to a political campaign when no clear argument about how it would benefit the community on the ground was ever made, let alone how it would directly benefit Aboriginal communities, let alone Tasmanian Aboriginal communities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw a news article recently where the chair of the board said they would not be changing their decision-making process. This deserves a relook. I'll be writing to the Tasmanian Auditor-General for him to examine the process and ensure future decisions reflect the original intention set out in law when the TCF was set up for genuine community good.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:14</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on an issue that, perhaps, has gone off the radar a little over the last few months. We've had the debate over the Voice, and we've had the debate in Western Australia, particularly, over the cultural heritage legislation. But, in regional areas, one topic that's being raised with me again and again is Labor's new superannuation tax. Perhaps it's not front of mind for many people, but it is front of mind for many small-business people and farmers out there who happen to have self-managed superannuation funds, because what this tax does, for the first time in Australia's economic history, is impose a tax on unrealised capital gains. I'll say that again: it imposes a tax on unrealised capital gains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you have a property or artwork or some gold in your super fund that appreciates in value above the threshold, you have to pay tax on that, whether or not you have the cash available. That means that farmers who have put part of their farming property quite rightly and legally into a self-managed super fund will have to find the cash to pay Labor's new tax if that farming property appreciates in value. They won't necessarily have that cash liquid, so what then will they have to do? In order to come up with the cash to pay the tax office, to pay this Labor government, they're potentially going to have to sell property. They will have to sell part of their farm to pay a tax bill. That is an outrageous impost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key principles of all taxation policy should be that it should not impose a burden on people who have already made decisions about their future under completely legal, legitimate arrangements. This new Labor superannuation tax explodes that principle. It forces small-business people, particularly farmers, who are in this position to potentially have to sell assets in order to pay a tax bill on an unrealised capital gain. Nobody has made any money yet. It's a book entry. It's a piece of land that's gone up in value from $1 million to $2 million. As my colleague in the chamber Senator McDonald would know very well, agricultural land can change in value a lot, and it's not necessarily a value change that is linked to the amount of money that is generated from that property. Sometimes those two things are quite divergent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of something you could have as a small-business person in a self-managed superannuation fund is gold. We all know that gold is countercyclical. Gold can appreciate in value very quickly, particularly in difficult economic times. So if you were in that situation, where you had some hard assets like gold in a self-managed superannuation fund, and you suddenly saw a spike in values, you could have a significant, unrealised capital gain that you will then have to sell an asset to pay the tax on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This should never have been brought forward as a realistic idea. It is completely contrary to every principle of good tax planning that Australia has followed for the last 100 to 120 years. You do not tax a profit on paper. You tax a profit when it is realised—when that property is sold or when that gold is sold. You do not tax people for an increase in the value of an asset, particularly when that asset is being put aside for their future retirement. This is a policy that should never see the light of day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:19</span>):  Before I commence my remarks in relation to my chosen subject, I would like to compliment Senator Brockman for the contribution he's just made. It is common sense that we should not be taxing unrealised capital gains in people's super accounts. It is absolutely absurd that the government has introduced such a policy, and I really compliment Senator Brockman on his advocacy in that regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again this evening I stand up for the residents of Ipswich in relation to the burden which they are suffering under in relation to odours being generated by waste disposal operations in their region. On 17 September 2023 I attended a community meeting called by Stop the Stink. At that meeting members of the community had the opportunity in front of members of local government and state government—I was the only federal representative there—to voice their concerns with the ongoing odour issues they're facing as a result of the Labor state government's inability to apply the law effectively with respect to the operations of waste management companies in that area. Over the last five years there have been 26,000 odour complaints made by the people in Ipswich with respect to the operations of waste management companies, and Ipswich City Council has called for a public health inquiry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the councillors and the mayor of Ipswich City Council called upon the state government to implement a public health inquiry as requested by the residents of Ipswich. What has the Labor state government done? Refused to conduct the inquiry. I congratulate the Ipswich City Council, Mayor Teresa Harding and all the councillors for their advocacy for the people of Ipswich in this regard. I note their media release of 30 October 2023 where they indicated, firstly, that they have instituted legal action against a private waste operator called NuGrow in the greater Ipswich region. In their media relation of 30 October 2023 they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This action was lodged with Planning and Environment Court on 23 October as an Originating Application and is in addition to the current appeal NuGrow has lodged against Council for refusing its minor change development application.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The application alleges that NuGrow has committed planning offences relating to landfill activity, expanded composting activity, unenclosed composting and unapproved building work at their Swanbank facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the first limb of the media release. The second limb is that council has unanimously agreed to lobby the state Labor government to enforce the enclosed composting of organic waste. That's the second limb, to make sure that residents wherever they live in Queensland don't have to put up with the odour issues the people of Ipswich have had to put up with over the last too many years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Ipswich City Council in relation to the action they have taken. They should not have had to spend $8 million of Ipswich ratepayers' money taking enforcement action—legal action—in relation to the operations of these waste management companies. They've had to spend $8 million of ratepayers' money to protect the interests of Ipswich residents, and it's absolutely outrageous that Ipswich City Council has had to spend that money. What is also outrageous is the impact which the operations of these waste management companies is having on the people of Ipswich. I want to give two examples of this. After I attended the Stop the Stink community meeting on 17 September, I took the opportunity to organise a meeting with two residents who were particularly impacted by the activities and the odour. The first is a resident by the name of Michelle, and I'll quote what Michelle said. 'I moved from Melbourne to Queensland in December 2021. A few weeks later I started developing strange rashes, hives and dermatitis, styes in my eyes. No steroid creams or antihistamines would keep it under control, and it continued to become worse until I was covered, trying to cope with burning skin every. I also can't sweat, or I will break out in hives'. Since January 2023 Michelle has been seeing a dermatologist. She's had skin biopsies, skin scrapings, patch testing and blood tests. She now receives two Xolair injections once every month, and every fortnight she receives another Dupixent injection. She also takes medication, including four Telfast 180 every day. This is a medication usually prescribed at one every 24 hours. This is what Michelle says in relation to the impact upon her: 'I would just really like to live a normal life again without worrying about toxic odours interfering with my health and family, dermatitis, hives, not being able to go outside and the anxiety.' You don't deserve that, Michelle. You don't deserve to have to put up with that. No-one in my state of Queensland deserves to have to put up with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second resident I met was a wonderful lady called Tracey. Tracey sends me a copy of her complaints to the pollution hotline with respect to odour. She copies me in. I thought I'd bring in the complaints which she's copied me in on. On Monday 18 September—this was the day after the community meeting I attended on 17 September—at 7.42 am, she wrote: 'Odour is horrendous, putrid, composting mixed with chemical. After coughing and then dry-retching, I ended up with my head down the toilet. This seems to be the natural occurrence with me lately—head down the toilet after having a whiff through the window of one inch open, so no windows and doors open for us.' On Monday 25 September, she wrote: 'Odour is foul manure composting smell. It is a disgusting, putrid, horrendous odour. We had to get up and close the house up again. All windows and doors now closed.' On Wednesday 27 September at 7.27 am, she wrote: 'Odour is foul manure composting, very strong. My nose and throat have a burning feeling, plus lips stinging after vomiting. I was trying not to vomit, but I ended up doing it.' This is what Tracey is putting up with day after day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday 28 September at 2.05 am, she wrote: 'Odour is composting mixed in with fire smoke. It's making it worse because fire is very strong as well as compost—double whammy. All windows and doors closed. Can't breathe outside at all.' On Thursday 5 October, she wrote: 'Odour has just come through. It is disgusting, putrid, horrendous, manure composting smell.' On Saturday 7 October, she wrote: 'Smell is putrid, composting late last night. Got up to take the dogs for a pee.' On Sunday 8 October at 12.09 am, the middle of the night, she wrote: 'Burning compost smell so strong it's disgusting. Felt like I could be sick if I kept breathing it in.' It's day after day after day after day that the people of Ipswich are putting up with these odours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday 8 October at 8.51 am, she wrote: 'Odour is burning compost smell still from last night. No washing can be hung on line, or even go outside and sit in the sun.' Doesn't every single citizen of Australia have the right to be able to go outside and enjoy the sunshine? On Monday 9 October at 1.08 am, she wrote: 'Odour is strong chemical mixed with composting. Chemical smell is stronger than composting. Smell is making me feel nauseous and nose and throat irritated. Headache is coming on so quick too.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were further complaints on Tuesday 10 October at 7.47 am, Tuesday 10 October at 9.36 am, Wednesday 11 October at 9.32 am, Friday 13 October at 12.40 pm, Sunday 15 October at 8.42 am, Tuesday 17 October at 3.13 pm, Friday 20 October at 8.37 am, Saturday 28 October at 10.38 pm, Sunday 29 October at 2.57 am, Monday 30 October at 7.32 am, Monday 30 October at 8.40 pm, Thursday 2 November at 7.20 am, Sunday 5 November at 7.43 pm, and Monday 6 November at 7.50 pm. Even before I came in to speak in the chamber in relation to this important matter, Tracey sent me a copy of an email at 6.35 pm tonight. This is what Tracey says: 'Odour is dangerous because it's so strong I nearly collapsed. It smells of toxic chicken manure. It filled up kitchen and dining and lounge room. I could hardly breathe. I had a headache so bad my head is pounding.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely the people of Ipswich deserve a public health inquiry in relation to this awful issue which they've been facing year after year. Tracey and Michelle deserve nothing less.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:29</span>):  As a servant to the many different people in our one Queensland community, I was pleased to accept an invitation from Isaac Balbin, founder of cannabis.org.au, to attend last Thursday's national cannabis industry roundtable. What a pleasure it was meeting Isaac, Rhys and their team in Melbourne and speaking with other members of parliament who, like One Nation, believe medicinal cannabis is long overdue for sensible downregulation. Medicinal cannabis is marvellous. Proven over thousands of years, in the 1920s it was America's most prescribed medicine before Big Pharma realised it could not make as much money from a natural plant. There are now 820 varieties—and growing—in the Australian cannabis cultivar database, many developed to suit specific health conditions or needs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorian MP David Limbrick made sensible comments about where the line between government regulation for the good of society and personal freedom should be—and it's nowhere near where it is now. Legalise Cannabis Party MLC from Western Australia Sophia Moermond spoke to the need for some level of personal growth. While we may not agree on personal growing, there was so much commonality in views being expressed. I'm excited for the potential of the cannabis industry uniting behind a sensible cannabis downregulation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">United Kingdom member of parliament Crispin Blunt updated us on how this is progressing better in the UK than here and provided a framework for evidence based drug policy. Now, that's an idea I can get behind: evidence based policy on medicine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Australia's leading cannabis doctors, Dr Nic Guimmarra, Vice President of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, raised his concerns that the current licensing schedule has led to a situation where some disreputable cannabis clinics are pushing patients through so quickly that the resulting prescription and instructions for use are counterproductive for the patient. It's One Nation's belief that the heavily regulated and restricted pathway system is burying the Therapeutic Goods Administration in paperwork that it's not checking, causing suboptimal care and, likely, patient harm as conditions worsen instead of being treated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why One Nation advanced legislation to downregulate medicinal cannabis so that any doctor can prescribe medicinal cannabis for any patient with a medical need and have that prescription filled by a chemist on the PBS. Our legislation harmonises the THC level below which a planet is hemp, not cannabis, to one per cent. This aligns with changes made in all states. The bill further adds a level of THC and CBD below which a pharmacist could sell the product to an adult without prescription.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to hear Michael Balderstone, President of the Legalise Cannabis Party and a legend of the Australian cannabis industry, warn that new hybrid cannabis strains with THC of up to 35 per cent were a concern needing some regulation. Thirty-five per cent THC is insane. It would suit the treatment of chronic pain and palliative care and very little else. Michael called for some commercial growth activity as otherwise development of new strains will be compromised. This is the problem with free growing without a commercial option. The plant works best when the profile of THC, CBD, terpenes and flavonoids are set to the needs of a person with a specific health condition. Unlike pharmaceuticals, with natural plant cannabis, one size is not expected to fit all. For this development to continue, it needs a commercial market presence. Consensus in the industry may ultimately fall on some level of licensed free growing. One Nation will cross that bridge, in consultation with our members, when we get there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday I heard an analogy for free growing. It was the belief that, just because people can brew their own beer, it doesn't mean people will. In fact, almost nobody does, because people can readily buy what's needed commercially. The challenge is to take out the industry's criminal elements while providing the widest range of quality Australian whole-plant and natural medicinal cannabis at an affordable price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a scandal that regulatory authorities insist on tight volume controls that enable criminal gangs to provide much of the domestic medicinal supply. These are gangs that lace cannabis with narcotics and then deliberately target kids at events like Schoolies. The TGA is driving practices hurtful and dangerous to children. It's a scandal that the minister could downschedule cannabis today yet has not done so; scheduling is regulatory, not legislative. It's a scandal that some in the cannabis industry, including pioneers, have developed their business under the current regulatory regime environment and see downscheduling as a threat to their nice little money-earners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no reason the entire cannabis product offering that the TGA has authorised for prescription under their restrictive pathways program could not be offered in schedule 4, for any doctor to prescribe—products that have already been prescribed successfully and safely for many years. The minister could use a regulatory instrument to make it happen today, yet he will not, because predatory billionaire owners of pharmaceutical companies pull the strings in Canberra. Australians with a medical need for cannabis don't get a look-in. This government is saying to everyday Australians, 'Your needs don't matter.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The TGA monitors impacts of cannabis and has found that medicinal cannabis has a lower adverse event rate than prescribed pharmaceuticals. Sensible downregulation will save lives. It will provide hundreds of tailored strains of medicinal cannabis designed to ease suffering and improve the health of our society, while taking the profit and control away from crime gangs. I look forward to working with cannabis.org.au to make this happen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Acting Deputy President, as a servant to the many different people in our one Queensland community, my second topic tonight is solar and wind energy's financial failure. The tide is now against out-of-touch elitists whose income insulates them from the hardship their virtue-signalling, feelings based beliefs cause Australians. The recent referendum showed that the good sense of everyday Australians will shine through. Recent polling shows working Australians deserting the Albanese government over the cost of living, housing and immigration—crises due to virtue-signalling, feelings based urban elitist policies.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at disasters in recent months engulfing the green dream. Orsted, the huge offshore wind charlatan, booked a US$5.5 billion writedown on the value of its offshore wind installations, and the stock price this year is down 50 per cent. Last week, Norway's Equinor booked a $300 million writedown on its offshore wind portfolio. Its share price, though, was saved due to its investment in oil and gas. Siemens Energy is down 60 per cent after losses in offshore wind caused a return on investment of minus 17 per cent—negative. Vestas is down a third after announcing losses in its wind division and is now offering a return to investors of minus 11 per cent. This is from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Review</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Express</span> reports that electric vehicles lose value for owners at twice the rate of internal combustion engines. Insurance policies are rising at twice the rate because of EVs' rising maintenance costs. In America, Hertz announced it is losing money on its EV fleet, and it's now scaling down purchases. The American Automobile Association tested EVs and found that, with a family of four and their gear on board, the highway cycle range of a family EV was reduced by 25 per cent, whereas petrol cars actually get greater range. American EV dealers now have a hundred days of stock sitting in showrooms. <span style="font-style:italic;">Business Insider</span> reports that EVs have hit a market share plateau. There are only so many rich public servants ready to waste money on virtue-signalling vehicles suited to short city trips. The share price of the United Kingdom's EV company Arrivals has fallen 96 per cent. <span style="font-style:italic;">Drive</span> magazine says more Australian EV sales will actually increase demand for coal, since solar and wind generation is insufficient to charge these things.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent large demonstrations against offshore wind should have caused Minister Bowen to take stock, yet he's now full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes. Ignorance never ends well. Sydney's inner-city elites will not have to look at these monstrosities, because the Labor Party are installing huge wind turbines off the workers' suburbs in Newcastle and Wollongong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the ESG corporate blackmail is hitting resistance. In the last week, United Kingdom investors withdrew $1 billion from ESG funds, making it five months in a row of negative inflows. Last year a paper showed that ESG funds do not offer returns superior to those of regular investment funds, which is why Vanguard pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative last December due to poor returns and risk. Last July, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"Green" investing has hit a crisis. Mounting questions over standards and effectiveness have been building for years. This year, investors voted with their feet and rushed for the exits.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Whatever way you cut it ESG is a thematic—in creating exclusions it means investors will have more volatile returns than a fund that simply invests for the best return.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Large corporates, superannuation firms and investment funds have a fiduciary duty to investors to operate for the best and safest returns. ESG is not safe and not profitable. ESG initiatives rely on government handouts.</span>

                  </a>  who had a fantastic Diwali Mela event on Saturday and Sunday. I was privileged enough to be there on the Saturday night with, I think, 15,000 Western Australians of Indian heritage in a celebration of light defeating darkness, a celebration of dance, a celebration of culture and a celebration of the wonderful contribution that the Indian community makes to my home state of Western Australia, and we were blessed. We had a fantastic opportunity to watch the performance of a Mr Terence Lewis. I am not surprised that none of my Senate colleagues yet know about Terence Lewis. Terence Lewis is very famous in India. He is a famous dancer and choreographer whose sister happens to live in Perth, Western Australia. Terence Lewis was well received by the crowd and did a fantastic performance that kicked off a night of celebration. So my heartfelt thanks and congratulations go to the Western Australian Indian community for putting on such a fantastic event over the weekend in the heart of Western Australia's capital city, the Perth CBD.</span>
