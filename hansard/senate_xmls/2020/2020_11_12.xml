                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  by leave—A few months ago the Labor and Liberal parties made an agreement that limits how often senators can put up motions. Motions aren't legislation; they're used to express the views of the Senate as well as do things like get documents from government, set up inquiries or introduce bills. Because of this agreement between the two big parties, I'm unable to put up more than one motion per week. I put up a motion on Monday hoping it would be voted on. The major parties blocked me from having it considered, and that counts as my motion for the week. I'm all tapped out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday was Remembrance Day. The Labor Party put up a motion having a go at the Liberal Party because it didn't like the way a Liberal senator had been carrying on in an inquiry. The Liberals put up a motion having a go at the Labor Party over the Victorian Premier's handling of COVID. Queensland Labor senators put up a motion congratulating the Queensland Labor government for being terrific. The Greens put up a motion having a go at everyone for not paying attention to what they're saying on climate change. One Nation put up a motion criticising the World Economic Forum for putting out some obscure proposal I'd never heard of. We spent an hour dealing with motions, and I couldn't do anything. Yesterday was 11 November; it was Remembrance Day. Nobody moved a motion to honour that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor used its motions to congratulate itself and have a go at the Liberals. The Liberals used their motions to congratulate themselves and have a go at the Labor Party. The Greens moved the same motion they move every day, and One Nation moved some weird motion nobody outside the darkest corner of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> after-dark programming has ever heard about. I can't move anything because the Labor Party and the Liberal Party decided a few months back that crossbenchers like me were taking up too much time in the Senate dealing with motions; therefore, we were put on rations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we've heard some revelations about activities that many people have known for a long time have gone on in this building. It is long past time that women in this building are safe and that exploitative relationships between ministers and their staff end. We've called on the Prime Minister to show some leadership and to take action. All we've heard is that this isn't his problem, that these issues are in the past and that there's a process. We took a good look at that process, and it's full of holes. The process does not have any implications for the alleged abuser. There is no power for the finance department to discipline a member of parliament or a MOP(S) Act employee who is found to have sexually harassed, bullied or intimidated an employee in this building. This government has held up a process that is entirely inadequate and does not protect women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, there is a legacy of poor behaviour in this building, and it's not just about sexual harassment. We've seen sports rorts and dodgy, doctored documents. The list of conduct, which is either corrupt or getting pretty close to it, is as long as your arm. That is not only why we need a federal integrity commission—which this Senate agreed with and passed my bill on more than a year ago, which has been languishing on the House <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>s—but also why we need an integrity commissioner and some parliamentary standards. At the minute, those ministerial standards are not only weak but discretionary. The Prime Minister chooses to turn a blind eye on so many occasions. They're not independently administered, and so frequently no consequences flow. That is why we need a code of conduct that is independently enforced, that has teeth and that actually applies to all MPs and their senior staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a suggestion—the process set out in the National Integrity (Parliamentary Standards) Bill 2019, which has been inquired into by this Senate. Surprise, surprise! The big parties said they didn't think it was needed. The government even went so far as to say, 'We should look at the existing process, and, if there are gaps, we should fill them.' The gaps are obvious. The gaps are that women have no recourse, their careers are over and they don't get to work in this town again. The MPs often get a promotion, and the women get blacklisted. The process that currently exists is weak and is an insult. It is making the problem worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We would like the Prime Minister to show some leadership and to fix the process. We've seen nothing from the Prime Minister this week—no leadership, no proposals and no acknowledgement that there is even a problem. We've put forward a suggestion for the Senate to consider. It's gone through inquiry. It would address not only sexual harassment, misconduct and abuse; it would address those other dodgy conducts that are not quite dodgy enough to be considered technical corruption, because our other bill will address that. So this is a sister bill to clean up the conduct of MPs in this building. We would like this matter addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, MPs have gotten away with abusing their power. So often it's the young female staffers that suffer the consequences. It's their careers that end, not the MP's. This building is not a safe workplace. We even saw the head of the ACTU yesterday describe this building as a high-risk workplace. The Prime Minister refuses to acknowledge there's even a problem. The process that does exist is discretionary because the Prime Minister's ministerial standards are completely up to him to enforce and they only apply to ministers. The Department of Finance's complaints process doesn't lead to any outcomes. It doesn't have any implications for MPs, because it's beyond their jurisdiction. This is a process that's been through inquiry, could be rolled out and would help address the cultural problems in this building. It would help clean up this toxic workplace and make sure that the standards that apply in other workplaces apply here too. It's not too much to ask. This is the parliament's 'Me Too' moment, and it's incumbent on all of us to be part of the solution. I hope that this national integrity bill, which is a counterpart bill to my ICAC bill, is taken seriously and I hope that we see the Prime Minister acknowledge the problem and do something about it.</span>

Serious issues deserve serious investigation and serious consideration, and there are processes in place to deal with them. Sadly, all too often in this building when serious issues are raised, people also seek to turn those serious issues into political opportunism, political stunts and political tactics, and that is what we are seeing from the Greens this morning. Rather than respecting processes that are in place for individuals to work through—the Department of Finance or other legal avenues and opportunities that are available to individuals—if they so choose, instead, based on some media reporting, the Greens decide that it's time to pursue political opportunism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government won't support the Greens in their politically opportunist approach. The government won't support the Greens when they choose to simply grandstand on issues. The government won't be bowing or buckling to the idea that the Australian Greens have some sort of moral authority that is superior to everybody else in this building.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters is trying to change the government program for the day, and the government program for the day includes legislation important to the nation. The first order of business for the day is the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. I note the fourth order of the day—the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill 2020. These are important policy issues, and important issues that affect all Australians who look outside and beyond the politicking of this building and who look outside and beyond the types of gestures that we get from the Australian Greens; these policy issues actually deal with helping the day-to-day lives of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is getting on with dealing with the day-to-day issues that affect Australians. In the midst of a global pandemic, Australia has managed to stand tall. We've responded with a health response to keep Australians safe. We've managed to stand tall with an economic response to ensure economic security for Australians. Just last night we were dealing with, again, cheap politicking from the Australian Greens, and at that time the Labor Party as well, in relation to support we were providing to try to get young Australians into work, into jobs. What all of these issues—our health response to the pandemic, our economic response to the pandemic, the JobMaker program, NDIS legislation, and recycling and waste reduction legislation—have in common is a government focused on policies that matter for Australians.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take Senator Waters's interjection, because women's safety matters enormously to this government as well. That is why our government has invested significantly in support for all Australian women in terms of the type of policies that have been pursued by Senator Ruston and by Senator Payne in their respective portfolios, which I am sure Senator Ruston will seek to touch on in this debate. It's why, throughout the pandemic, we have been mindful of providing additional financial support and services. When we saw there was a potential risk of domestic violence or other circumstances arising during lockdown phases, during high-stress phases for Australians in the pandemic, we provided the extra mental health support and we provided extra assistance. We were proactive in addressing those types of issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We take issues raised in relation to the operation of this building seriously as well. They're not to be dismissed, but nor for the sake of supporting political points should they be elevated, as the Greens propose to do, above the issues that are important to Australians in their day-to-day lives. We as a government will continue to pursue all of our policies in relation to supporting Australian women in the workplace, to supporting them in their homes and to supporting Australian families, but we're not going to be distracted in this place by insider tactics ahead of our NDIS legislation, recycling legislation or other matters of great importance.</span>

If I can just address that point first: we were advised by the Greens at about 9.28 this morning that they were intending to do this. That didn't allow us the time, or the respect, frankly, to deal with the issue they have raised and the argument they have put this morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads me to agree with the government that the decision by the Greens isn't actually about dealing with the substance of the matter but is more about getting a five-minute speech up to show that they are the only ones taking this issue seriously. That is a problem, but it says everything about the Greens in this place—the fact that they don't give courtesy to the people that they need to work with in order to successfully get this up; they decide at the last minute to do this and then they seek to take an issue that has caused some considerable distress to people who work in this building this week and choose to deal with it this way. I think that is really unfortunate, because the Greens will have had the same conversations that we have had this week in light of the issues that have been raised. They will know that there are people who work in this building who have not found it to be a great workplace at times. That is the issue that all of us in this place should be looking to resolve and to improve upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Greens to think that they can deal with the issue seriously through a suspension of standing orders at the last minute on the final day for a bill that they could list for substantive debate says everything about the Greens, unfortunately. I do like working with you, Senator Waters, but this has really disappointed me, because as someone who works in this place, you will understand what the allegations this week have done. The message to me is to look at how we can we work as leaders in this place to make sure that our workplace is the best it can be. I don't think the way to deliver that is through a political stunt by suspending standing orders. I actually think there's a more serious discussion that we should be having and that we should be taking the lead on—not necessarily us, as women, but all of us in this place, as colleagues who employ people in a large workplace. We should be dealing with it. There are many other ways to progress that and I would welcome the engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are discussions happening across the building about how to deal with it—not to pretend that there aren't issues in this workplace, because there are, and we all know about them. That is the issue we should be dealing with, not manufacture and create some kind of stunt—and I'm trying to look for another word, because I hope it's not a stunt, but that's what it looks like to me—as a way for the Greens to grandstand and pretend they're the only people standing up for integrity, 'The major parties this and the major parties that, they never stand up for you'. It's just simply not true. We have supported, and do support, a national integrity commission; we have supported legislation in this place and we do believe the government is dragging its heels on that. But the Greens have tied that to an issue about workplace culture and standards, tagging it to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>program and using it for political expediency. I reject that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would welcome a discussion with you, Senator Waters, about how we can actually deal with some of the issues and make sure this workplace changes, and changes for the better. It is a serious message that was sent through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> show, and one that challenges all of us. We shouldn't just sweep it under the carpet and pretend that there's nothing going on. I don't agree with that. I think we should be responding to it, and responding to it in a way that gives hope and confidence to the people who work in this building—that they can come to work, be safe and be treated with respect. I think that, for the large part, that is what happens in this workplace. But, where there are outliers, we need to be dealing with those and putting in place a framework that ensures that this workplace is the best in Australia and that it sets the highest standards. But is that going to be delivered by this suspension? No, it's not, and it was never intended to be. It was intended to give the Greens 10 minutes to try and point the finger at everybody else.</span>

I am going to show my respect to a very important woman who lost her son, who was a veteran, through suicide. As I was saying, Julie-Ann Finney was here in this building to make sure that the 20 years of service her son, Dave, gave to this country—</span>

                  </a>  I will be supporting the motion of the Greens this morning on respect and women. As I was saying about Julie-Ann, showing respect to another female, she deserves every bit of it. She has earnt that. I can tell you now she has been hit down by many of those men out there. It has been very difficult for her, not only losing her son but what she's been through and the abuse she has been through on social media from men and some of those who have served and are serving. Yesterday she wore a yellow armband to remember her son and remember those veterans like Dave who have lost their lives and been lost to the war at home on home soil. She was here yesterday to serve as a living and breathing reminder of what we are supposed to mean when we say, 'Lest we forget.' Did we forget yesterday, or did we remember but decide not to acknowledge it anyway? When you say the ode in this place and you do that out of respect and you say these words, 'We will remember them,' what do you mean by that? While you were busy in here yesterday hurling insults at each other, nobody bothered to put up a motion for Remembrance Day. I'm not saying this to shame you. I'm saying this because I hate the fact that Julie-Ann and many others, including veterans, saw what happened in here yesterday and I, as an Australian senator, am absolutely ashamed and embarrassed by it.</span>

I would have thought that one of the most important conventions that exist in this place is making sure that we build everything on the basis of respect. I would like to draw to the Senate's attention that at no time prior to moving this motion this morning did the mover of the motion, the Leader of the Greens in the Senate, Senator Waters, even bother to raise this matter with me as the Manager of Government Business. Senator Waters, I have never given you any reason to suggest that I would not take seriously any request the Greens put forward. I as the Manager of Government Business have never ever done anything but engage respectfully with you, and yet you didn't think it warranted even raising this with me this morning. However, you did raise the matter with the Manager of Opposition Business in this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also draw to the attention of the chamber this morning that a second action happened this morning, prior to this action, which once again was seeking to undermine the integrity and respect that I believe this place operates on and has operated on for as long as I have been here. It is disappointing that I as the Manager of Government Business had a request this morning just before the chamber opened from a senator who expressed the desire to make a contribution in relation to Remembrance Day yesterday. Given that the person who requested it had been a serving member of the Defence Force, and I know how passionately she feels about matters that relate to that, I said to the senator if she wished to make a short statement in relation to Remembrance Day I would let her do that. Instead, she did not make a statement about Remembrance Day. I think it is timely to remind everybody in this chamber the best way for us to make sure that we run a reasonable chamber is actually by having discussions.</span>

The safety of people in workplaces is of paramount importance, and I can assure you, as a member of this government, there is nothing that we take more seriously than workplace safety and making sure that everybody has the right to feel comfortable in their workplace.

                  </a>  Senator Waters has been a great advocate in relation to domestic violence. But, Senator Waters, if you were for real in relation to your actual commitment to this, you'd be working with me instead of coming in here and trying to politicise these issues. Because, as we all know, domestic violence and family violence is a particularly serious issue in the Australian economy. It absolutely devastates people's lives. It devastates families and it devastates children. We put in place the largest commitment and the largest amount of money behind domestic violence programs with the $340 million that was put behind the Fourth Action Plan. In addition, we immediately jumped to put money to support the frontline services to help women and their children who found themselves as victims of domestic violence through this COVID pandemic. I find it really quite disingenuous to have to be standing here today and, hopefully, voting down this ridiculous stunt that seeks to do nothing more than virtue signal on behalf of the Greens and puts nothing in place that's going to help Australian women in the workplace and Australian women who are victims of family and domestic violence.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I want to start by responding to the incredible accusations that have been levelled against Senator Waters and the Greens by Senator Birmingham, Senator Ruston and Senator Gallagher. Honestly, to describe this as a stunt, to describe this as virtue signalling, just goes to show how out of touch you are. We are putting forward here a constructive proposal that has been inquired into by this Senate, that presents us the opportunity to collectively endorse a framework and a code of conduct that has teeth—a framework and a code of conduct that can be independently applied. And today we have heard that neither of the major parties are going to support this. As Senator Waters very accurately pointed out, the gaps in the current frameworks are abundantly obvious, and to suggest that somehow we are doing this out of a political motivation is completely and utterly wrong. What we are doing here is offering you the opportunity to join with us in endorsing a solution that will significantly improve the culture of this workplace, a solution that will allow for complaints to be assessed independently and a solution that will benefit women who, ultimately, are overwhelmingly the people who pay the price for the toxic workplace here in Parliament House. I want to say thank you to all of the women who've spoken out so bravely on this issue over this week: the women outside this parliament who bravely and courageously told their stories to the ABC and more recently through other outlets, and the women in this place who have taken the lead here. But I want to say something now about men's responsibility. We men in this place have a responsibility to show leadership, and, in doing so, we should pay tribute to and be inspired by the women of this place who have taken the lead. But, as men, we need to man up, we need to take responsibility and we need to acknowledge that, overwhelmingly, it is men who are the problem here and, overwhelming, it is women who are paying the price for men's behaviour. And we're not going to fix this problem unless we men man up in this place and accept responsibility for the way men are behaving and play our role, with the women of this place, in providing solutions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Australian Greens are trying to do today. We want all the men and all the women of this place, no matter what party we represent, to join with us in solutions, because what we've seen this week is a Prime Minister who simply tried to kick the can down the road. We have seen a Prime Minister who is not prepared to act. We want to give the opportunity to all senators to join us in trying to fix the toxic workplace culture in this place that impacts so grievously and overwhelmingly on women. This is a constructive suggestion by the Greens. It is as far from a stunt or from grandstanding or from virtue signalling, whatever that means, as you could get. It is a constructive proposal that would allow us to come together and address the problems that have been exposed so terribly about how it is for women who have to work in this building, and in politics more broadly in this country. This is an opportunity for everyone to join with us. We want this to be a collaborative and constructive process, and we are taking a collaborative and constructive approach.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  Well, here we go again! Is there any topic that is not safe from a Greens stunt? We see it over and over again. We see it on climate change issues, we see it on refugee issues, and now the Greens are willing to stoop so low that they will pull a stunt around very serious issues involving the sexual harassment of female employees in this building.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many speakers from all sides, including Labor, have made clear over the last couple of days in particular, these are extremely serious issues that need to be dealt with seriously. Labor have taken various steps on these matters within our party. We're told the government has. I don't know what the Greens have been up to as we know they've got issues they haven't dealt with properly. But rather than deal with those issues seriously, what the Greens do is revert to type and think, 'How can we pull a stunt that supplies our next meme material?' That's all they care about; the meme will be going out right about now, I'd say. Rather than actually deal with these issues, they pull another stunt. They told the opposition about this stunt about two minutes before they pulled it. That's how serious the Greens are about dealing with these issues properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Greens were serious and genuine about trying to deal with these issues, don't you think they'd come and talk to people whose votes they knew they needed more than two minutes before they pulled it? But that wasn't what this was about. This was about gaining half an hour to speak so that they could all cut their little social media videos and pump them out into every inner-city location around Australia, being the only locations around Australia they actually care about. It was all a platform for more Greens grandstanding, more Greens stunts, rather than taking the serious action that needs to be taken in relation to these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's support for a national integrity commission is well known, has been in place for a number of years now, and we are disappointed that the government hasn't taken action on this. But I think to try to use a national integrity commission as part of a stunt around sexual harassment issues tells you all you need to know about what the Greens are really about. They are not sincere, they are all about stunts, they are not serious. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  As we were discussing last night, it is really important to consider both the context and the policy outcomes in which frameworks like the safeguarding commission exist. We talked last night about the discrimination, the isolation, the segregation and, ultimately, the institutionalisation of disabled people in Australia. The policy context created by the ableism, which is the reality of many of our daily experiences, means many of the policy solutions that are foisted on us, if you like, reflect these discriminatory thought processes, particularly the idea that decisions that affect disabled people can be made without talking with disabled people. And that is the background to that famous catchcry of our community, 'Nothing about us, without us.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia there are many legislative examples of this action without consultation taking place right now. The chief example at the moment is the proposal to implement mandatory independent assessments. Mandatory independent assessments is a project which the Australian Greens fully oppose. We oppose mandatory independent assessments foisted upon NDIS participants without exception or excuse. Why have we taken this very strong position? We have taken it because we have done something that seems radical to the major parties—that is, talk to disabled people. Disabled people have told us clearly: 'We do not want to see mechanisms put in place which will mean that people we don't know, have never met, will come into our lives and make judgements about our capacity and our needs, and those judgements will then shape our access to the scheme. No, no, no—absolutely not.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is something that is antithetical to the principles upon which the NDIS was created, and it is something which the agency is pursuing without having spoken to disabled people. Its so-called consultation was an email survey, the subject of which was a small population of only three types of disabled folks in a very specific geographic area in New South Wales. Of all the people who participated in that trial, only 28 per cent actually responded to the survey, and it is from that 28 per cent that the agency is drawing its conclusion that this is apparently a good idea to go ahead with. This is something we oppose now and will continue to oppose, and we look forward to the day when we see the Australian Labor Party join with us in that campaign to oppose mandatory independent assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look back at the commission, we also see that there have been many decisions made about its processes and functions that seem to have been developed without proper consultation with disabled people. It's particularly evident to me that the commission does not do enough to engage effectively, particularly with First Nations disabled people, and that at the moment its processes are not working for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and for First Nations people. The complaint mechanisms and the entire focus of the commission at the moment seem to be far more on gradual quality improvement of services provided by registered NDIS providers than on the proactive, human-rights-guided investigation of complaints, abuse and exploitation. That is the culture shift we need to see in the agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does very little to shift the agency in that direction. It grants additional powers around the ability to make banning orders, and allows those banning orders to be placed on individuals whether or not they are still registered service providers or working in that space as support workers. That is a good thing, as well as the ability of the commission to communicate in more detail with the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission—a good thing, again, but nowhere near enough. At the moment we are undertaking an extensive inquiry into the quality and safeguards commission. At the conclusion of that inquiry, it is so important that the recommendations the committee makes are turned into meaningful actions taken by this place to improve the safeguarding process, and that, at the same time, we as legislators recognise that regulatory safeguarding frameworks are only one element of the broader work that is needed to be done in our society to remove ableism, to remove discrimination and to support disabled people to participate in the community, to be socially connected and to be engaged in education settings and workplace settings in a way that forms those natural safeguards that are the ultimate solution when it comes to making sure that disabled people are safeguarded from violent abuse, neglect and exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be supporting this bill this morning, and we look forward to continuing the work of improving these processes in consultation with disabled people. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  [by video link] The National Disability Insurance Scheme is providing vital services to some of the most vulnerable people in Australia. Often, people with disability who rely on the NDIS for support have difficulty with mobility or communication and can face significant challenges advocating for themselves. This can make them particularly vulnerable to violence, neglect, abuse, exploitation and other forms of harm at the hands of those who have been charged with their care. Concerns about the abuse and neglect of people with disability has been so widespread they have led to the establishment of the royal commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These kinds of incidents are at the most serious end of the scale when it comes to matters investigated by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. This bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020, will expand the range of circumstances in which the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner can issue a banning order. A banning order prohibits or restricts activities by a provider or by a person employed or engaged by that provider, and a banning order is one of the most serious regulatory responses that is available to the commissioner for ensuring that providers comply with their obligations. They're used in circumstances where poor-quality services or unsafe practices have the potential to lead to harm for NDIS participants. Sadly, we've already seen the deaths of NDIS participants due to the actions of a provider. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced in response to the death of Ann-Marie Smith, a 54-year-old with cerebral palsy who died of severe septic shock, multi-organ failure, severe pressure sores and severe malnutrition. I know I was shocked to hear about this, as I'm sure everyone else was. Ms Smith had been confined to a cane chair, and, despite her NDIS package including six hours of support per day, reports are that she only received two hours of care per day and had not been seen outside her house in years. Another death was that of David Harris, a 55-year-old who was schizophrenic, diabetic and incontinent, who died after his funding services were cut off. His body was not discovered until two months—two months—after he died. How can that happen in our society? If that's not shocking enough, his grieving sister discovered that his support had been cut off because he missed an annual review meeting. While Ms Smith's death appears to have been the catalyst for the bill, sadly, the amendments proposed by the bill are unlikely to have prevented her death if they had been in place then. But they are sensible amendments, and Labor welcomes and supports them. But we know that more needs to be done to prevent the abuse and neglect of NDIS participants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this bill will expand the circumstances in which the commissioner can make a banning order. It will give them the power to make a banning order against someone who is not considered suitable to be providing supports or services to people with disability. This could be, for example, because of inappropriate actions in a previous caring role, such as aged care or early childhood education. It will also allow the commissioner to issue a banning order against someone even if they are no longer employed or engaged by an NDIS provider. So, if a person is trying to avoid being banned by temporarily ceasing their employment or engagement in the NDIS, a banning order will prevent them from re-engaging in the scheme. Finally, the bill will give the commissioner the power to provide details of banned persons on the NDIS provider register, subject to privacy protections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes have the broad support of stakeholders, although some have said that they are only a first step in protecting NDIS participants from harm. In an article on the Disability Support Guide website, Director, Media and Communications at People with Disability Australia, El Gibbs said of the proposed changes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"We're pleased to see the first step towards improving the safeguards for people with disability that use the NDIS. The recent death of Ann-Marie Smith, and other abuse of people with disability, have exposed the many gaps that exist in the current system."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The next step needs to be ensuring that the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has the powers and resources to proactively investigate and conduct random spot-checks on disability support providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same article, Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia CEO Geoff Rowe supported the changes but said their effectiveness would depend on how the new powers were used. Mr Rowe said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"I think giving the Commission a way to ban a provider or to ban an individual is not a bad thing and the question comes back to what is the metric that will be used …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The devil is in the detail, how they determine who should be banned, what consultation will they have with people with disability and the sector about where the threshold should be."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Ms Smith died, Labor called for an independent investigation into her death, and the government tasked Federal Court Justice Alan Robertson with reviewing 'the adequacy of the regulation of the supports and services provided to Ms Ann-Marie Smith'. With the death of David Harris, we argued that the inquiry should be broadened to include his case. Given the government refused to do so, we believe a separate inquiry into this matter is warranted. What NDIS participants really need is an inquiry to look at the question of whether the commission has been effective in fulfilling its role in multiple cases, not just Ms Smith's. As welcome as Justice Robertson's inquiry is, we need a proper inquiry that has broader terms of reference and subpoena powers, which the Robertson inquiry did not have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Robertson handed down his report at the end of the August and it contained some very important findings. Among the report's recommendations were that the commission identify earlier people with disability who are vulnerable to harm and neglect. It recommended that vulnerable people should never have more than one carer and should have a specific person identified in their plan responsible for their safety and wellbeing. The report also recommended community visitor schemes; occasional visits to vulnerable participants, including spot checks; and improved reporting of incidents and complaints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of these recommendations go to what I think was at the heart of the issues surrounding Ms Smith's death—that is, the lack of oversight of the care she was receiving. Stakeholders, such as union and disability advocates, have told Labor that the commission is reactive in many cases, focusing on incidents after they happen. Some of Justice Robertson's recommendations are about identification and more proactive monitoring of participants vulnerable to harm. While Justice Robertson's report did not identify any failings in how the commission carried out its functions, that was because the commission's scope is too narrow. When the commission was launched in 2018, Commissioner Graeme Head AO said that it had comprehensive regulatory powers and functions and real regulatory teeth. If the commission has real teeth then how is it that Ms Smith's provider, Integrity Care, only received a paltry fine of $12,600 for failing to notify the commission of her death within 24 hours? In two years of operation, this is the only infringement that the commission has issued, and that was probably only due to the publicity surrounding Ms Smith's death. From the 8,000 complaints it has received, it has issued only 23 banning orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme has shown, most participants don't even know the commission exists and therefore wouldn't think about going to it if they had a complaint about their provider. Is this what the taxpayer gets for $35 million in operating costs over the past two years, including $2 million in executive pay? In the 2020-21 budget, the NDIS commission was allocated 100 more staff and $92.9 million in funding, over four years, to 'expand its compliance and investigative capacity'. Of course we welcome any boost to the commission's capacity, but it was revealed at estimates that this funding will add only six investigators nationally. Given the commission is swamped with complaints, appointing just six investigators is hardly going to put a dent in addressing the sheer volume of abuse and neglect cases in the NDIS. It's seven months since Ann-Marie Smith's death. The government needs to do everything in its power to stop tragedies like this happening again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not a silver bullet, and nor are any of the other changes related to the commission. The buck doesn't just stop with the commission when it comes to quality and safeguards. The overall management of the NDIS is important, not just the oversight. If the government are serious about protecting people with disability from neglect and abuse, then I implore them to look beyond the scope of the commission to the management of the NDIS in general, because there is only so much the commission can do to ensure quality and safety when the system is broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, under this government there has been a history of mismanagement and neglect in this area from the minute it came to power. We've yet to see any serious action from the Morrison government to fix the messes they have made with the NDIS. I suppose that's hardly surprising because, after all, it was a proud Labor reform that those opposite inherited. It's a reform they reluctantly picked, although their heart was never really in it. I have no doubt that those opposite would dump the NDIS in a heartbeat if it wasn't such a popular reform and if it wouldn't be seen by the Australian public as a poor and heartless decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken at length in this place about the frustrations many NDIS participants and their families are experiencing. I just want to remind people of some of the points again, because they are really relevant to the debate we're having now. I heard a number of these complaints in a forum I facilitated last year which included NDIS participants and their families; Labor's shadow minister for disability, Bill Shorten; and the Tasmanian shadow minister for disability, Jo Siejka.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard stories of people with newborn babies who had immediate pressing needs and it taking six months to have their plans approved. We heard about parents being denied respite care, despite exhaustion from providing around-the-clock care to their children. We heard about families having claims knocked back and spending hours upon hours completing paperwork and running around seeking medical reports to justify their claim. At the same time some were having their reports second-guessed by people with no medical qualifications, others were having their work going to waste because their reports weren't even read. We heard of lengthy delays of payments to service providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we heard at that forum was merely a snapshot of the chaos surrounding the NDIS. I acknowledge that the experience of the NDIS has been positive for many participants. It remains a proud Labor reform. It's a vast improvement for people with disability on the fragmented state and territory systems that preceded it. But for a number of participants it has been bogged down in bureaucracy and red tape, subjecting them to lengthy delays and inexplicable and inconsistent decisions. Delays in the scheme, particularly in getting plans approved or receiving equipment, have resulted in 1,200 Australians with disability dying while waiting for funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As if the shortcomings for current participants aren't bad enough, the NDIS is also failing to reach every person eligible to participate. I mentioned last year that there were over 6,500 Tasmanian participants in the NDIS, even though it was estimated that around 10,600 were eligible. I am pleased to see that there are now just over 9,000 participants in Tasmania, which is a significant improvement but still a fair way short of the estimated number of people eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be of little surprise to those opposite that the NDIS is in such a mess when they continue to massively underspend on the scheme. Is it any surprise when the Morrison government has ripped $4.6 billion out of the scheme? The government's underfunding of the scheme led to the Victorian Labor minister for disability, Luke Donnellan, and his Liberal counterpart in New South Wales, Gareth Ward, joining forces in February to call on the Minister for the NDIS to release the money. Minister Ward was quoted by the ABC at the time as saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I want to make sure that money doesn't sit in a bank account offsetting the Commonwealth's budget, which is what it's doing. I want to see it improving the lives of people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the government no longer has to prop up its artificial surplus, it has no excuse not to release the funds to thousands of Australians with disability who need them now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is welcome; it's necessary. But it's just the beginning of what the government needs to do to fix its NDIS mess. The Morrison government needs to fully fund the NDIS and restore the $4.6 billion it has ripped out of the scheme. It needs to fix the bureaucracy and end the delays and the inconsistent decisions. It needs to establish a wide-ranging inquiry into whether the commission is fulfilling its role as a watchdog and, if it isn't, to give the commission real teeth. Those opposite need to act urgently before another Ann-Marie Smith or another David Harris becomes the victim of this— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I rise in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020. This bill has its origins in the death of South Australia NDIS participant Ann-Marie Smith. The wilful neglect, suffering and tragic death of Ann-Marie on 6 April this year left us all deeply shocked and reeling. To be clear, it was not her disability that killed her; it was the actions of her carer that killed her. The manner of her death was entirely preventable. Ms Smith had loving parents who made provisions for her. She was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and needed significant assistance for toileting and hygiene. Her house had been set up to enable her to be well looked after long after her parents' deaths. However, she had to rely on a carer for all of her needs following the death of her parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ann-Marie died after being deposited in a woven cane chair in her living room for 24 hours a day for over a year. That cane chair operated as both her toilet and her bed. She was neglected by those paid to care for her in ways that are totally unimaginable. It's hard to comprehend that cruelty so vile could be inflicted on someone so vulnerable. Ann-Marie's NDIS provider, Integrity Care SA, was banned in August from operating and had its NDIS registration revoked. That prevented the organisation providing services through the NDIS. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has not released the report that formed the basis of that action, except to say that it was because of 'a number of contraventions of the NDIS Act'. That would have to be a complete understatement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is only a partial response to the shortcomings in the system that led to Ann-Marie's death. And, whilst it has taken several months to be debated in the Senate, the better course would have been for the government to have waited until Alan Robertson SC had completed his review to properly legislate and fix the safeguarding gaps within the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the regulatory oversight highlighted in the review. The government has not chosen to do that. Instead, it has legislated minor changes which allow for the banning of a carer from further NDIS work, including in circumstances where the carer is no longer employed by the NDIS provider. While this change is welcome, it must be said that it would not have prevented Ann-Marie's carer from neglecting her, because the carer was at the time an employee of Integrity Care SA. This bill would allow the pre-emptive banning of a person from disability work because of their actions in an adjacent non-disability area, like aged care or child care. This would have caught out Ann-Marie's carer, because she had also been banned from Domiciliary Care SA due to allegations of theft. However, the measures in this bill do not go far enough. They do not implement the many recommendations made by Alan Robertson SC in his independent review, except for one of them, which extends banning orders to former providers by a further amendment the government moved to this bill in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has a wide range of compliance and enforcement actions, including seeking injunctions and civil penalties, and revoking and issuing banning orders on a case-by-case basis. However, it is difficult to comprehend that, despite the NDIA receiving 8,000 complaints in the last two years, only 22 individual carers were banned, and only one fine—one fine!—was issued for $12,600, and that was to Integrity Care SA for failing to report Ann-Marie's death within the required 24-hour notification period. It's astounding that NDIS providers failed to do exactly what Integrity Care SA did on 200 separate occasions, yet none of them got a fine for the same breach. Significant issues also exist within the NDIA and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission in relation to safeguarding the wellbeing of people with a disability and, particularly, vulnerable NDIS participants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said that the changes proposed in this bill alone will not prevent future abuse, neglect or worse. They just make it a little better with respect to banning orders. Alan Robertson SC was asked to identify what should have happened in relation to Ann-Marie's care and whether there were any failings on the part of the NDIS, and to make recommendations to prevent the neglect suffered by Ann-Marie happening to any other person with a disability. He highlighted many safeguarding gaps in a system meant to protect people with a disability. Sadly, the government has failed to respond to or implement the many important changes required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight two areas underscored in the independent review which seek to implement significant changes on how the NDIA and the NDIS commission work best for people with a disability, and which seek to safeguard against abuse and neglect. These are: 'No vulnerable NDIS participant should have a sole carer providing services in the participant's own home,' and the establishment of the commission's own community based visitor scheme similar to schemes currently operating in states and territories. The critical circumstance in Ann-Marie's case is that she became invisible and isolated from everyone except for her sole carer, the sole carer who now stands charged with manslaughter. Ann-Marie had no interaction with family, friends or neighbours for a long time and did not even have a GP visit. She was totally cut off from the world; she was completely dependent on her carer, and no-one was watching. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Safeguarding Task Force established by the Marshall government following Ann-Marie's death said in its final report: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At least one of the extra pair of eyes seeing what is going on should come from proper supervision of support workers by the service provider agency, and ensuring that more than one support worker is involved, even if the participant only wants a single person whom they trust and respect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If only Integrity Care SA had ensured that Ann-Marie had the extra pair of eyes looking out for her and someone else caring for her, the outcome could have been very different. I recognise the operational challenges faced by providers, even small providers, in requiring more than one carer for a vulnerable NDIS participant. However, these valid considerations must be weighted against the need to protect vulnerable participants from all forms of neglect and abuse. Ann-Marie's case brings this issue into sharp focus, and we must not lose sight of this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also needs to legislate for a community based visitors scheme to be implemented by the commission as another mechanism that might guard against vulnerability. A community visitors scheme provides the kind of external input needed, with someone coming in and being able to talk to participants about how things are going in their lives. The community visitor could then refer matters of concern to the NDIS commission. A visitor for Ann-Marie was not available under the community visitors scheme in South Australia, because she was an NDIS participant and outside the scope of the scheme. Having the NDIS commission operate its own equivalent community visitor scheme is consistent with the commissioner's core function in the NDIS Act, section 181E(b): </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to develop a nationally consistent approach to managing quality and safeguards for people with disability receiving supports or services …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advantage of the NDIS commission having such a scheme in relation to NDIS participants is to provide a national and uniform approach to safeguarding against abuse and neglect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make the point that being a person with a disability does not make you vulnerable, but we must protect against the circumstances which make all people vulnerable. To that end, I foreshadow my second reading amendment, which notes the recommendations made by the Hon. Alan Robertson, SC, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent review of the adequacy of the regulation of the supports and services provided to Ms Ann-Marie Smith, an NDIS participant, who died on 6 April 2020</span>—from abuse and neglect—and calls on the government to implement the recommendations in consultation with the disability sector, including the introduction of a national community visitor scheme. With those words, I commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Ensuring that, as a nation, we care for Australians with disability is one of our most important responsibilities. As a former assistant minister for disability services, this is a responsibility which is very close to my heart. The NDIS is an incredible scheme, unlike anything else in the world, but we, as a government and as a nation, have to make sure it continues to operate in the best interests of people with disability at all times. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020 is another critical step in protecting those with a disability in our community. We've heard in this debate some shocking stories of people with disability who have died as a result of horrific neglect, including Ann-Marie Smith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incomprehensible to imagine that Ann-Marie Smith was left in her woven cane chair, dying from septic shock, multi-organ failure, severe pressure sores, malnutrition and issues connected with her cerebral palsy. She was given no nutritional food and suffered from very poor personal hygiene—and that's being kind, I have to say. The 68-year-old woman who cared for Ms Smith has been charged with her manslaughter. I note that the coronial and criminal investigation into this death is continuing, and I will be circumspect in what I say because of that. The criminal law has stepped in now and has charged the carer of Ann-Marie Smith. It is reprehensible to consider that people with disability are subjected to abuse, neglect and horrendous treatment like that which Ann-Marie Smith suffered. That is precisely why the Morrison government has initiated the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the further issues that have been raised by Senator Griff in particular, I want to say that our work is not done. We await what we expect will be very comprehensive recommendations from the royal commission about the further action that our government needs to take to protect people with disability. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission does play a very important role in protecting people with disability by ensuring that they have the very best of care, support and respect. Of course, we know that the commissioner has the power to make a banning order to prevent a provider or a worker from providing any NDIS supports or services. But the powers of the commissioner do not currently extend to making a banning order against a former employee of an NDIS provider, including someone who may have been terminated as a result of their horrendous conduct against a person or persons with disability. Currently also, the NDIS commissioner does not have the power to impose a banning order against a provider that has left the sector. This includes providers that may have closed down their operations as a result of grievous conduct—including, of course, violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation against persons with a disability—so as to avoid a banning order being made against them. So this bill is a very important initiative in that it fixes this to ensure the NDIS commissioner has the power to make a banning order, even if the employer or provider has left the NDIS. The bill also provides that the commissioner has the power to make a pre-emptive banning order against a person or provider identified as unsuitable to work in the disability sector as a result of their actions in other sectors, such as aged care or child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these amendments also compel the NDIS commissioner to publish details of every banning order on the NDIS provider register. This is a very important measure and is why the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which I chair, rejected the legal advice provided to the committee and found that, despite the privacy issues, this measure—the publication of banning orders—was a very, very important measure and was in the context of human rights law a permissible limitation in that it was reasonable, necessary and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is implementing the most substantial package of reforms to the NDIS since its establishment, whilst continuing to deliver very significant and immediate improvements to the NDIS. We now have more than 400,000 participants in this world-leading scheme—an increase of approximately 100,000 participants over the past 12 months—and 175,000 people, a compelling figure, are receiving supports under the scheme for the very first time. The NDIS is a scheme of which we should all be mightily proud. It was initiated with bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been made very clear, the NDIS is demand driven and fully funded, so I want to take issue, obviously, with the misrepresentation made by Senator Bilyk in her contribution. As part of the 2020 budget, the government has announced a further $3.9 billion for the NDIS over the forward estimates to reflect demand for the NDIS into the future, which will see an increase of 14.5 per cent in NDIS funding between 2020-21 and 2021-22.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is another important reform for the NDIS, a world-leading scheme. It reflects the very important responsibility that we as a government have to protect people with disability. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was established to manage the funds and support measures for the disabled. The support is in recognition of the specialist needs of those who have disabilities to help them live a normalised life. On the surface, it is a wonderful concept that seeks to address a need that any well-rounded and caring society should take care of, but the NDIS that has materialised is failing. It is costly. Money is not distributed fairly to those who need it, and others are paid well in excess of what they should be. It has been besieged by criminals, including organised crime groups and also those ever-present unscrupulous vultures who always seem to loiter around, ready to exploit any loopholes in any financial support handout system. Some clients are able to self-manage their payment regime in cases requiring no proof that their expenditure is legitimate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the name of fairness and financial responsibility, we need to make changes. Previous reviews have suggested the scheme has been plagued by delays in decisions for applicants. The system is confusing to understand and lacks flexibility in the use of funds. The NDIS costs Australian taxpayers an extraordinary amount of money. For the year ending 30 June, funds of $24 billion had been committed to services and support. Unfortunately, where there is big money, rorting follows close behind, and the stories of abuse of the system are beyond belief. The media has reported hundreds of cases of fraud each year by participants, providers, organised crime groups and dodgy individuals targeting the system to skim sufficient funds illegally. I have personally been advised of several examples of rorting, and the dollars are huge. They add up to being very big, very quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder that the NDIS is seen as a noose around Australia's economic neck. Unless there is a review and major changes are made, it will spell more disaster for the economy. Imagine this: $190,000 per year is paid to a diabetic patient who lost their leg as a result of their mismanagement of their health, another boarding-house resident is paid $160,000 annually and another person over 30 years of age is paid $40,000 annually for having a speech impediment. I do not believe a speech impediment should qualify for disability payments under the NDIS. These are huge payments that help to eat very quickly and deeply into the money available for the needy. I was told about one NDIS client, admittedly with a serious lymphatic condition, who was living well beyond an average life, living in absolute luxury, thanks to her payments. The client has happily spruiked Gold Coast holidays in a penthouse apartment and apparently will have a house built for her in which she can live rent free until her dying day—totally unacceptable. But, wait—there's more. The client also had enough money to be able to pay for a corporate box at a major sporting event and invite a dozen of her friends to join in the revelry. The client had no problems telling everyone that the extravagance was paid for by the NDIS, which in fact comes from the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the stories from a program that is supposed to help our most vulnerable and needy. Why are examples like this allowed to eventuate? Where are the checks and balances and the investigations of these sorts of examples? Is this the sort of flawed support system we are happy to allow and provide with taxpayer funds? The losers under the current NDIS are those forgotten clients who have fallen through the cracks and need genuine support to deal with their disabilities and injuries, and the taxpayers who fork out the billions each year to fund this colossal government agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of people supported by the NDIS has been growing at confronting rates, from 89,000 in 2016-17 to 172,000 in 2017-18, to 286,000 in 2018-19 and to 392,000 in 2019-20. We can brace for an even bigger number of beneficiaries in the current financial year. Figures given to me by the NDIS show it is expected to be approximately 450,000 people. If we are paying more than $24 billion for 391,999 people, then we are being taking for a ride by a very incompetent department. The fear is that too many of them will be overcompensated and not enough resources will be available to double-check applicants for funds and to hunt down fraudsters. That growth in clients comes with increased opportunities for this abuse. Australia, and the world, have experienced a devastating pandemic this year. We will soon have a debt of more than $1 trillion. As such, Australia needs to be much more prudent with its spending. It does not have the money to keep throwing funds away to any government program, especially the high-cost NDIS, without genuine security that identifies wastage and then makes the hard decisions to clean it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this spending comes as we are unable to provide proper support for our war veterans. If you lose your leg due to your own poor health practices, you get a handsome NDIS payout. But I am constantly fighting for those defence personnel who served our country to get compensation for their injuries. Further to that, we have age pensioners who also at times are overlooked to receive the support they need. They have worked all their lives, paid their taxes and, when it comes to mobility and health problems in their retirement years, their lifelong contributions to Australia are waved away. The hypocrisy is outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these factors support the need for a thorough review of the costs and proceeds of the NDIS. There are now approximately over 10,000 providers, with more and more signing up because of how lucrative it is. My suggestion is that approval for new providers should be made not by an everyday quack but only by a government approved doctor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some examples of the problems from media reports. In 2017, thousands of children with no identified deficits compared to the normal range for their age and development delays received funding, while some other Australians with profound disabilities fell through the gaps. On that issue, I believe children with developmental delays should not be receiving funds from the NDIS; they can access other programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 2018, 313 tip-offs of fraudulent or dodgy dealings were made to the NDIS agency, and about 100 were classified as alleged fraud. Later that year, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> reported that more than 500 allegations of potentially fraudulent payments and financial anomalies were being investigated by the NDIS. Just months later, the government announced a new task force of 100 people to crackdown on fraud, including by organised crime operators, some of which had siphoned tens of thousands of dollars from client support packages. In October, one operator was charged with stealing $480,000 worth of funding from the scheme in just two months. And the list goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekend Australian</span> revealed that in a nine-month period almost 40 providers had their registrations terminated for fraud and compliance issues. In May that year, members of an organised crime syndicate were arrested after gaining at least $1.1 million from the NDIS, and they splurged that money on sports cars. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courier Mail</span> then reported that a dodgy day care operator pocketed $2.3 million in taxpayer funds through the NDIS—just one of 38 family day care operators across Australia who were sanctioned for claiming a total of $3.6 million from the scheme to care for disabled kids. In August, a whistleblower within the system reported how funds that were meant to support the disabled were used on lavish dinners, five-star hotels and chauffeur driven limousines. In February this year, a <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun-Herald</span> report suggested that thousands of dollars are stolen every day from clients, with the money simply reimbursed without being investigated. It also reports that as many as one-in-10 claims in the NDIS can be fraudulent. And, in August, a Sydney doctor was investigated for large-scale fraud. He falsified reports, overcharged for services and neglected the best interests of clients in the use of allotted NDIS funding. It's no wonder the scheme is in such disarray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of this bill, it does fix several shortfalls in the system, particularly in helping to ensure the quality of care being given to the needy is up to an acceptable standard. The bill introduces powers for the safeguards commissioner to be able to ban service providers who pose an immediate danger to the health or safety of a client. In the past, some of the workers were sacked for poor performance and were subsequently out of the system before they could be legally banned. It didn't stop them returning to the sector at some point, even if they aren't suited to the tasks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes sure of the banning of questionable service providers and their staff who are unsuited to providing these services. It allows those people to be banned, even though they are no longer currently working in such a role. The safeguards commissioner can also issue such bans to those who have not yet operated in the role of a provider but are deemed to be unsuitable for taking on such a role. These strengthened banning powers are welcomed to protect those who, through the purpose and nature of this sector, are vulnerable. However, it is important to address the other issues I have raised here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS must be improved to make sure we are not wasting money and that those truly in need of help are able to receive that help. With much of the rorting, the Australian government has apparently seen fit just to look the other way. This is unacceptable. I have just come from a meeting with the minister, who assured me that my concerns are being taken seriously and that they will be looking at this. I have a lot of confidence in the minister that this will be addressed. It is time to get serious. The NDIS must be reviewed. The rorting needs to stop. The problems must be fixed.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  [by video link] I briefly want to make some comments around our second reading amendment and make a couple of observations in relation to second reading amendments offered by the other folks in this place. To make it clear, what we are seeking to do with our particular second reading amendment is to call on the government and the commission to rectify one of the most concerning elements that was revealed in relation to the commission, which came out of Senate estimates a few weeks ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in the community will be aware that, in the aftermath of Ann-Marie Smith's disgraceful manslaughter, the government announced additional funding for the commission of some $92.9 million. The expectation of many of us in the disability community was that this money would go to funding additional investigative capacity for the commission so that they would be able to more effectively investigate complaints made to them and disentangle the very complex circumstances of abuse that often affect us as disabled people. Outrageously, it was revealed in estimates that no more than 10 per cent of the commission's workforce are actually folks that are dedicated investigators. Of this nearly $100 million of additional funding, only six additional investigative positions will be funded within the commission. This is just not good enough. It is unacceptable to us as disabled people, particularly as not one of those additional positions will be based in South Australia. So our second reading amendment calls on the commission and the government to increase the number of investigators on the ground in each state and territory, particularly in South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are happy to support the Labor Party's second reading amendment, and we will also ultimately support the second reading amendment made by Centre Alliance. However, I would just offer this observation in relation to this support: we in the Australian Greens take very seriously the obligation of consulting genuinely with disabled people. As I mentioned in my opening remarks on this piece of legislation, it is so important that we as legislators genuinely consult with disabled people before we come to conclusions about what recommendations and legislative changes are needed in order to prevent violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. The Robertson inquiry has made a number of recommendations in that area. It has been put to me, forcefully and convincingly, that there still needs to be an additional layer of consultation between the Robertson recommendations and any subsequent legislative action that is taken with disabled people, quite simply because Justice Robertson himself is not a disabled man. My understanding is that prior to his involvement in this judicial inquiry, he had not had significant time or professional background in dealing with the complex intersectional issues that affect disabled people and are involved in the exploitation and abuse that we face. So it is really important, as we seek to translate any and all recommendations, but particularly the Robertson recommendations, into legislation that we genuinely consult with disabled people before coming to conclusions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that Centre Alliance and Senator Griff, coming from the state of South Australia as they do, have been involved and deeply affected by the manslaughter of Ms Ann-Marie Smith, and share with me a deep desire to ensure that the situation experienced in the case of Ann-Marie never happens again. We share that in common, as people and as political parties, I am sure. I'm also aware that in the state of South Australia there is a live conversation within the community about the role that a national community visitor scheme may play throughout the country in preventing cases such as Ann-Marie Smith's happening, because we know they also happen, often and elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really important as we consider that particular reform that we consult with disabled people before the moment of implementation. It is not good enough to repeat a pattern of faux consultation, as we have seen with the independent assessments framework, where politicians come to a conclusion that there is a particular policy solution and then consult on its implementation. There is a need to consult on the very question of how we solve the problem, first, particularly with a community visitor scheme, because outside of South Australia and Victoria, these are not common programs. In the state of Victoria, for instance, the community visitor scheme has historically been focused on voluntary engagement with people in institutional settings rather than on broad residential visitation. There needs to be a space and a process by which we explore what it would mean to implement this nationally in all residential circumstances. We would also need to explore what we mean by 'vulnerability' and how we would go about giving disabled people the right to object to a characterisation of vulnerability. We would also need to explore interactions with complex cases, such as folks who may be neurodivergent, where it would be highly inappropriate, in some cases, to have somebody that they don't know bobbing in and out of their house at unexpected times. All of these complexities need to be considered before we arrive at the conclusion of whether or not a community visitor scheme is the best solution, or one of the solutions that are needed to prevent cases like Ann-Marie Smith's repeating themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with those clear and conscious caveats that we, the Greens, will support the amendment today, on the advice of our stakeholders and also in line with our historical commitment to consult with disabled people before coming to particular policy positions in relation to legislation that shapes their lives. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Strengthening Banning Orders) Bill 2020 strengthens the existing powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner to ban a worker or provider from delivering services in the NDIS market. The bill aims to protect people with disability and to prevent them from experiencing harm from service provision and the people who work closely with them. As an independent national regulator with an integrated function, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner plays a very key role in building confidence in the NDIS through its regulatory and compliance frameworks. It is therefore important that the NDIS commission has robust investigation and regulatory powers and can take strong action where serious matters arise that affect the safety of NDIS participants. As at 31 December 2019, 18,384 NDIS providers were registered with the NDIS commission; of those registered, 46 per cent were individuals or sole traders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS Act 2013 already empowers the NDIS commissioner to make banning orders. It has become apparent that the provisions under which these banning orders can be issued are too narrow. In short, this bill will strengthen those banning provisions in the act and allow the NDIS commissioner to ban a worker or provider they believe is unfit to deliver NDIS services, even if they are no longer delivering NDIS services. It will also allow a banning order to be issued pre-emptively to prevent a worker or provider who is not yet working in the NDIS sector from doing so in the future, based on information received from other sectors. This bill will also make it clear that the NDIS commissioner must use the existing NDIS provider register to include details of any current banning orders. This information will generally be publicly available, and people with disability and their representatives may search the NDIS provider register to ensure that providers or workers they are using are not subject to a banning order. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The strengthened banning order provisions support the aim of ensuring that unsuitable people who should not be delivering services under the NDIS cannot do so. This is an important part of developing trust in the NDIS market. Our paramount consideration is the right of people with disability to live lives free of abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation. We need to close these gaps in the banning order provisions, and the bill before us will do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not be supporting the second reading amendments that have been put forward by the opposition, because we believe the proposed amendments do not contribute to or support the coordinated way in which the government, the NDIA and the NDIS commission are working with states and territories on information-sharing arrangements and supports for at-risk and vulnerable participants. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  The Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020 sets out the proposed framework or structure for the newly established executive agency Services Australia to replace the now abolished Department of Human Services, DHS. The bill proposes a number of changes that aim to modernise terminology and streamline the reporting lines associated with transitioning DHS to Services Australia. Labor supports the modifications to government structures across the public sector that lead to good outcomes for employees and Australians who rely on those services. While this restructure may aim to do this, and we hope it is successful in doing so, the bill fails to address the biggest core issue at the centre of Services Australia—that the arbitrary staffing cap imposed across the public sector has led to an overreliance on labour hire agencies to keep up with demand, as well as an exorbitant overspend on outsourcing in consultants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Staff at Services Australia have managed a remarkable workload in recent times, from dealing with the bushfire response in January to managing the surge in new applicants for the JobSeeker allowance that arose throughout March and April. Services Australia staff are there for Australians in their moments of greatest need and sometimes greatest despair, whether it is providing financial relief to those unable to work, such as older Australians, carers and those with disability; providing access to counselling and social work services; or helping jobseekers to find meaningful occupations or prepare them to re-enter the workforce. These are undoubtedly tough but rewarding frontline service jobs, and the staff deserve our greatest thanks for their efforts always but, in particular, over the past few months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed the government's announcement on 22 March to engage 5,000 additional new workers to help move through the demand on Services Australia. But it wasn't lost on us that it is almost exactly the number they'd cut from the front line over the past six years. Services Australia ended up bringing in an additional 5,200 staff through existing agreements with their service delivery partners and other labour hire agencies, and there were 1,500 casuals directly employed by Services Australia. They were complemented by 3,400 staff redeployed from within Services Australia's own ranks and 1,700 staff redeployed from other APS departments and agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the height of the pandemic period there were approximately 800,000 new claims processed for JobSeeker, the same number of applications that would normally be processed by the agency across a two-year period. Many of these new applicants had never accessed Centrelink support before in their lifetime, with one in eight new applicants needing to apply for a CRN. This demonstrates that when you properly fund staff and resource the public sector they are capable of remarkable service, and Australians are very thankful to all the staff at Services Australia for their efforts in supporting the nation in its time of need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the demand for Services Australia's services is unlikely to dissipate any time soon—despite the Morrison government's plan to snap them back—with many Australians expected to experience unemployment or underemployment for some time. Labor remains gravely concerned that the DSS secretary, Kathryn Campbell, has now been returned to a position of oversight of an agency in which she was responsible for designing and implementing the robodebt scheme. She is now overseeing the mop-up of one of the worst first failures of governance in Australian history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the staffing cap was placed across the public sector without weighing up the capabilities or requirements of each agency or department either at the time it was placed or looking into the future. Doing away with the arbitrary quota will allow the newly established executive agency to recruit for the appropriately determined amount of resources required to deliver the ambitious agenda placed on them by the recent COVID-19 pandemic response without needing to rely so heavily on labour hire and external consultants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the ASL staffing cap is both a cut in real staffing numbers and privatisation policy by stealth. Agencies are forced to outsource, contract out, spend exorbitant amounts on consultants and/or engage labour hire contractors to staff departments to make up for the lack of in-house resources. Too many phone calls to Services Australia go unanswered every year, and Australians waste too much time on hold trying to access Centrelink services, causing great, unnecessary distress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more value to the taxpayer through staff being directly employed by Services Australia, without unnecessary spending on expensive labour hire agency fees. Directly employing workers within Services Australia provides an engaged, stable and experienced workforce with less turnover and a greater capacity to serve the needs of Australians. It is completely unfair and unnecessary to have two workers doing identical work but receiving different pay and conditions simply because one is lucky enough to have direct APS employment while the other is contracted to work through a labour hire agency. As many Australians inevitably struggle to re-enter the workforce following the Morrison recession, the professional services that the staff at Services Australia will offer will broaden and specialise in areas such as social work, financial counselling, job readiness and employment services placement. These are highly specialised areas, and no-one is better placed to support Australians than an adequately resourced Public Service, not labour hire employees engaged on an insecure basis and receiving lower pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I formally move the second reading amendment standing in my name and that of Senator Pratt, which has been circulated:</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I rise to speak on the Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020. This bill makes a number of consequential amendments to update legislation to reflect that Services Australia was established as an executive agency on 1 February 2020. Services Australia has now replaced the former Department of Human Services. The second part of the bill makes governance changes to executive staff at Services Australia—namely, the CEO of Services Australia will now perform the existing statutory roles of the chief executive of Centrelink, the chief executive of Medicare and the Child Support Registrar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand this bill seeks to make service delivery more efficient and effective. I would like to say that the government has a lot of work to do to ensure that Services Australia is trusted by the people it serves. To many, the agency is known as Centrelink. Although it undertakes other services, the interface most people have had problems with, I have to say, is Centrelink. There's a lot of work to do to make sure that Services Australia delivers services and serves Australians. Trust in Services Australia—called 'Centrelink' by a lot of people, as I said—has been severely eroding for quite a long time but particularly since the robodebt debacle. Some people who settled their robodebts are still having difficulty having their debts reviewed. I've heard from people who have faced significant difficulties getting answers about their debts, including those debts that were raised before 2015. The government says it's now easier to have debts from before 2015 reviewed, but I've had a lot of feedback that that is still extremely difficult and that people aren't getting adequate responses to their questions. People across Australia are doing it incredibly tough, with millions of people experiencing unemployment and underemployment. Despite this, the government has decided that this is the right time to resume chasing people for debts. I'm worried that this will result in many new debts being raised, given the huge increase in the number of people on income support payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have little faith in Centrelink's ability to resolve these debts fairly and clearly explain the process. One of the major reasons Centrelink fails Australians is to do with staffing levels and investment. We saw a huge mobilisation of new staff at Services Australia at the beginning of the COVID period, which was to support the massive influx of people accessing our social safety net. We acknowledged at the time, and continue to acknowledge, that the huge increase in the number of staff helped tremendously in making sure that people could access the social safety net in a fast and efficient manner. An additional 500 staff were brought on to deal with the increase in demand. But it shouldn't take a pandemic and a recession to ensure that the Centrelink call centres and offices are adequately staffed. Centrelink should have adequate staff all year around. These staff should be properly paid and employed in ongoing positions, instead of contract positions. The government has started winding back the number of surge staff who were brought in, but we need to ensure that Centrelink has sufficient permanent staff so that Centrelink can meet the need. Recently we heard about Centrelink offices being closed down and staff being laid off. Thanks to strong community pressure, the government backflipped, at least on one decision, earlier this year, which was to close—</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Ensure that foreign investors are not permitted to purchase any further Australian agricultural land, agribusiness, water, or any public asset such as seaports, airports, council aerodromes (which the Chinese are buying and turning into Chinese flying schools but which could present a security risk in the future), bridges, railways, electricity grids, telcos, hospitals, medical companies which could present a patient privacy risk, or any government department entity or security-sensitive real estate.</span>

Any temporary tightening of FIRB rules in a distressed economy such as during the Covid-19 pandemic should be made permanent. Foreign investors could be permitted only to lease agricultural land and farms for a maximum of 10 years with strict regular monitoring to confirm ongoing compliance with Australian standards and environmental laws. There should be strict limits on the percentage, area and QUALITY of Australian land that could be leased. For too long our politicians and bureaucrats have been calling foreigners buying up our farms and assets foreign "investors" when they are actually foreign BUYERS who will never sell back to us.</span>

Selling our food-bowls, farms, dairies and dairy processors, wineries and wine processors, water, hospitals and infrastructure should be considered as NOT being in Australia's national interest. Preservation of Australia's food and water security and Australia's infrastructure should be considered to be of paramount importance by the government, the FIRB and the CIC (Critical Infrastructure Centre).</span>

If a sale or lease is found to be not in the national interest of Australia, or if there is non­ compliance by the foreign owner with the conditions of a sale or lease, that sale or lease must be reversed.</span>

China has declared its intention to use the Port of Darwin for its Belt and Road (BRI) / Silk Route initiative, which puts us at risk of losing our trading autonomy under China's control of trade routes.</span>

The Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land should be available for the Australian public to view. It should NOT be kept secret to protect foreign owners' privacy.

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Foreign ownership of Australian farms, rural land and water will only harm the Australian economy and is not in the national interest. Foreign owners are already setting up their own processing facilities on farms they purchase. These farms will compete with Australian farms and ultimately force Australian farmers out, ruining our own agribusinesses such as dairy, beef, lamb, fruit, wine and seafood. Foreign owners will ship out the value-added produce, dairy, wine, seafood and meat through the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin and other ports and airports that they own with no benefit to Australia, and cause severe hardship to our farmers. There is currently (July 2020) a proposal by WADE (WA Dairy and Energy) to build a Chinese-backed baby formula factory in WA which will use 20,000 Australian cows and 100 million litres of Australian water to export 30,000 tonnes of baby formula per year which will all be shipped to Asia and none will be available to domestic customers. Local dairy farmers are deeply concerned that the establishment of this Chinese-backed factory will destroy their livelihoods.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Foreign ownership of our farms and rural land will result in the loss of Australia's food security. We are already being forced to import inferior, possibly contaminated food because our own food will be scarce, unavailable or too expensive as the result of foreign farmers in Australia or Australian farmers who have sold out to Chinese interests exporting what was once Australian-owned food to China or other parts of Asia. Chinese diners are now consuming our rock lobster (95% of which is exported to China). This is being accelerated by free trade agreements such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA). Australians, on the other hand, are finding it increasingly difficult to source premium Australian fish so are forced to dine on imported Vietnamese catfish and Asian basa farmed in the polluted Mekong River.</span>

This could render the land useless and contaminate adjoining lands and waterways. This has happened in other countries that now want to buy our pristine farms because they have polluted their own food­ sources. Bulldozing of habitat will deplete populations of our iconic wildlife, possibly leading to extinction of some critically endangered species.</span>

Chinese ownership of our hospitals also presents a security risk for patient confidentiality. The 2019 purchase by Chinese state-owned Sinosteel of the WA Oakajee port, railway, Jack Hill iron-ore mine and intellectual property connected with the deal presents a risk to our national security. This deal needs to be examined very closely by FIRB and the CIC.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Selling our land and selling/ long-term leasing of our assets to foreign private investors or foreign state­ owned interests such as sovereign wealth funds puts us at risk of diplomatic incidents in the event of Australia wanting to change the terms of a free trade agreement, or not being willing to sign up to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), or in the event of military unrest in the South China Sea region or the Pacific. With every sale of a farm or critical asset we lose some of our sovereignty when we should be strengthening it. The 99-year lease of the Port of Darwin to Landbridge, a Chinese company with links to the CCP and Chinese military greatly increases our national security risk, particularly in the light of our long-standing close relationship with the USA. The buying of some of our electricity and gas networks by the State Grid Corporation of China is worrying in view of the fact that the State Grid Corporation of China has intimate links to the Chinese military and Intelligence collection. In fact, most private companies in China must also be assumed to have links to the CCP and therefore must not be given the leniency that other countries with which we have free-trade agreements have been given. Hong Kong, too, has now come under the control of the CCP and must also not be allowed to buy our land, water, infrastructure or other assets.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Once our land and assets are sold to foreign countries we will never get them back because the foreign buyers want our farms to feed their own people. The Chinese will never sell Australian land they buy because they are not allowed to buy land in China - they can only ever lease it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would allow a short inquiry—considering the time frame from the end of the year and the Christmas break—into an important piece of legislation. It will also allow for consideration of any issues raised by the Samuel report, which has not been publicly released yet, and for that to be reported back to the Senate. We hope that the government is able to agree to this. It's not a long inquiry. It will allow for consideration of the Samuel report plus fresh consideration of any issues raised through that process prior to the debate on this bill. I understood that the government was considering moving an amendment to allow a short referral, and I understand that's not the case anymore. So, if senators do want a referral of this bill, they will need to support this amendment. Hopefully, we will get support from the Senate for this important amendment to this important piece of legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  The Senate has debated this issue a number of times now. It's clear that there is a strong will within this place for a proper review into this piece of legislation. As Senator Gallagher has eloquently described, we are still waiting for the final report into the Samuel review, and I think these things need to be considered together. Of course, there needs to be a legitimate time frame for this. We are now quickly heading towards the end of the year. We only have two sitting weeks left in this place. We need to make sure, if we're going to inquire into this piece of legislation, that the committee can report at the earliest possible opportunity, that being February. Suggesting that an inquiry into such important legislation could be done within a shorter time frame than that would make it simply all looks and no substance. This shouldn't be just a tick-and-flick exercise. This is an important issue into drastic changes to Australia's environment laws. So the Greens will support this amendment put forward by the opposition, and we urge the government and the crossbench to be realistic about the time frame here. Anything shorter than this will be a joke.</span>

I note that it is supposed to be tabled within 15 sitting days of the minister having received the report, and I don't think the statutes prevent earlier tabling. We know from estimates that the minister now has the report. Can you give some advice in respect of that, Minister? That would certainly help me to make a decision on the way in which I would vote on this amendment.</span>

                    </a>  I will keep this short. When people look at the report they'll see there are a number of bills that have been referred that have extremely short reporting dates. I know that this year has been difficult and the government wants to get things through, but two weeks? A number of them have to report on bills on either 27 November or 2 December. Some of the bills are quite complex and need further review than the limit of the two non-sitting weeks between now and our last two sitting weeks. I want to put on the record that that gives the committees insufficient time, particularly when there is a large number of bills that the committees have to consider. It really is too short a time to give these bills the proper consideration that a normal legislative review committee process would take.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I just want to raise a more general question. These short reporting requirements are quite difficult for the committees that actually have to do the work. The one that I'm particularly concerned about is the provision of the Immigration (Education) Amendment (Expanding Access to English Tuition) Bill 2020, with a reporting date of 27 November. There has been no consultation, as far as I'm aware, with the committee. It makes the work of the committee almost impossible. It makes a mockery of the Senate committee system: you can't possibly call for submissions and do this work properly. It actually denigrates the Senate for this to happen. But above all else, those on the Selection of Bills Committee are happy to allocate other people's time without consideration of the consequences or of what they're doing. In consequence, we are asked to make serious judgements about important matters of public policy. This is simply not satisfactory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill formally revokes the approval of remaining vocational education and training providers that operated under the VET FEE-HELP scheme, but provides for the continuing application of the law for the purposes of dealing with any matters that arose while a body was approved under the VET FEE-HELP scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth's obligation to pay amounts of VET FEE-HELP assistance to VET providers in respect of older student data will cease. No student has an entitlement to VET FEE-HELP assistance in relation to units with a census date after 31 December 2018, however a small number of providers continue to lodge old claims dating back a number of years. Therefore, the Commonwealth will continue to make payments to VET providers only if the providers report certain information by specified deadlines. The deadline for reporting information for units with census dates before 1 January 2018 is 1 July 2021, while the deadline for all other units is 1 January 2022. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will prevent unsuspecting students from incurring VET FEE-HELP debts indefinitely in relation to study they undertook many years ago, potentially dating back as far as 2009. Those students will also be protected by a measure which will discharge their liability to pay to VET providers any amounts relating to tuition fees not reported before the specified deadlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many VET providers are also higher education providers receiving amounts of FEE-HELP assistance under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Higher Education Support Act 2003</span>, or approved course providers receiving VET student loans payments under the <span style="font-style:italic;">VET Student Loans Act 2016</span>. To facilitate the collection of debts owed by VET providers to the Commonwealth under the VET FEE-HELP scheme, the Bill enables the Commonwealth to offset those debts against VET student loans and FEE-HELP amounts payable by the Commonwealth to those providers. This means the Commonwealth will be able to pay a net amount to a provider, rather than make a VET student loans or FEE-HELP payment, and separately invoice a debt under the VET FEE-HELP scheme. This will be both simpler and cheaper, saving the processing of invoices and payments, for providers and the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also provides for further circumstances in which the Secretary is not required to pay a VET student loan amount to an approved course provider under the <span style="font-style:italic;">VET Student Loans Act 2016</span>. These circumstances reflect existing provisions in that Act under which a student's HELP balance can be re-credited. This measure makes clear that the Secretary is not required to pay an approved course provider a loan amount in circumstances where the student would then become eligible for a re-credit, and the provider would be required to re-pay the amount paid to the Commonwealth. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Protecting Consumers from Predatory Leasing Practices) Bill 2020 is to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Security</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Administration)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1999</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to provide that the department secretary may not make any deductions requested by a person from their social security payments if the deductions relate to goods hired under a consumer lease entered into by the person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor has consistently advocated for greater protections for consumers in this area in response to consistent concerns about improper behaviour by consumer lease providers and payday lenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor will not stand by whilst low income, vulnerable Australians are exploited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is needed to remove the potential for clients in receipt of social security payments from Services Australia to suffer financial harm as a result of entering into one or more consumer leases for household goods for which Centrepay deductions are available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The main provisions of the Bill remove the power for the department secretary to enable deductions from a person's social security payments in order to pay for a consumer lease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The service known as Centrepay was established in 1998 as a budgeting and financial capability tool to assist Centrelink (now known as Services Australia) clients by paying rent and utility bills through automatic deductions from their welfare payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">More than 600,000 people use Centrepay to pay bills, rent and ongoing expenses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proliferation of consumer leasing businesses as approved Centrepay service providers is contrary to the policy rationale for Centrepay to enable people to budget and ensure that regular bills and essential living expenses are paid directly from their welfare payment or pension payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It indicates that Centrepay is being used for the benefit of commercial interests, rather than the interests of Centrelink clients making the payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Centrepay has been open to access by businesses whose products, particularly consumer leases, disadvantage consumers and have the potential to cause financial harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, the consumer leasing industry actively uses Centrepay to prey on the financially vulnerable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Far from helping Centrelink recipients to budget, Centrepay deductions for consumer leases can impact an individual's ability to pay for essential goods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The impact is particularly severe on marginalised groups: Remote Aboriginal communities have been targeted by payday lending and consumer lease companies through the use of Centrelink's Centrepay system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill follows significant campaigns by non-government organisations and consumer advocates, who have formed the Stop the Debt Trap Alliance and are calling for further action on payday loans and consumer leases, as well as investigation by Senate committees into this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2019 report of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into Credit and financial services targeted at Australians at risk of financial hardship found that the benefit to consumer lease providers of being registered through Centrelink is clear: automatic deductions reduce the default rate for companies, while also allowing them to continue to charge the consumer for products well above the cost of the product. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The benefits to recipients are less clear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Centrelink clients are subjected to exorbitant interest charges - in some cases of over 800 per cent - and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has found the cost of household goods leased from rent-to-buy businesses can cost nearly nine times the retail price of the same goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASIC also found that lessors often charge higher amounts to Centrelink recipients than they advertised to other customers, and at the end of the lease and after all that expense, the consumer does not own the goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite this, Services Australia has refused to enforce its own Centrepay policy, which is supposed to prohibit products that are financially exploitative and continues to allow the worst consumer lease providers to access vulnerable customers via Centrepay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will ensure that Centrepay is prospectively closed to consumer leasing companies, for the same reasons it is closed to payday lenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will apply prospectively, meaning no individual who has entered into a consumer lease agreement using Centrepay will be required to terminate that lease as a result of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If this legislation is enacted, there are safer payment options that would still be available to people wanting to purchase household goods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senator Doug Cameron first introduced legislation to remove consumer leases from Centrepay in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has consistently refused to act administratively to address this problem and prevent harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence, Labor is again taking the initiative to ensure this service cannot be used by consumer lease providers to exploit Australians on low incomes.</span>

Without English, it is harder to get a job, harder to integrate into the community and harder to participate in our democracy. Australians and the Australian government value the hundreds of other languages spoken in our country, but they recognise the English language as the basis of Australia's success as a cohesive, multicultural society. This motion once again illustrates the inappropriateness of dealing with complex policy issues in a single vote, without amendment or debate, denying almost all senators the opportunity to explain their positions before going to a vote.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens support this motion. With hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and more than a million people unemployed and already stagnant wages, it's clear that we need massive investment in secure, sustainable and rewarding jobs if we are to rebuild after this crisis into a just society. This can't be done without generational investment in education and training to equip people in communities with the skills that they need. Whether you're just leaving school, you're between jobs in a recession or you're looking to retrain, you have the right to a world-class education. Making TAFE and university fee-free for all and investing in resources and staff of our public education institutions is the vital first step to achieving this vision.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government is strongly committed to combatting transnational, serious and organised crime. Organised criminal groups systematically target the health, prosperity and safety of Australians, and in the process erode public trust in institutions. The cost to Australia's economy alone is estimated to be up to $47 billion each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The realisation of profit is the primary motivation underlying transnational, serious and organised crime. These groups mercilessly pursue profit, having no regard to the harms caused. As a result of this, money laundering has become one of the key enablers of the criminal business model, allowing the profits of crime to be realised, concealed and reinvested in further criminal activity or used to fund lavish lifestyles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Criminal and terrorist threats are not static. Methods to launder dirty money and finance terrorism - by their very nature - evolve to exploit opportunities, with criminals and terrorists constantly working to find new ways to circumvent controls and avoid detection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, our legal and policy settings must also continue to evolve to ensure law enforcement agencies can effectively combat and disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Anti-Money Laundering and Counter</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Terrorism Financing and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2019,</span> which I introduce today, is another example of our commitment to dismantling the criminal business model. The Bill is the next phase of the Government's reforms to bolster our Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing or AML/CTF regime, to prevent criminals from enjoying the profits of their illegal activities, and to stop funds falling into the hands of terrorists. This regime is centred on hardening the financial sector against these threats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also improve Australia's compliance with the international standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing set by the Financial Action Task Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will now outline the specific amendments contained in the Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first reform is to Customer Due Diligence requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key pillar of the AML/CTF regime is the requirement for regulated businesses to identify their customers and verify their identity. This enables regulated businesses to identify, and efficiently manage, any money laundering or terrorism financing risks posed by customers and the services provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will broaden the circumstances in which the approximately 14,000 regulated businesses may enter into an arrangement with another regulated entity to rely on checks already conducted. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments are expected to reduce the cost of customer verification for businesses, delivering a substantial saving of up to $3.1 billion over ten years. This amendment furthers the Government's agenda of reducing unnecessary regulatory burden and improving the customer experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends correspondent banking obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Correspondent banking relationships are essential in the global payment system and vital to international trade and the global economy as a whole. They allow one bank to provide services on behalf of another, while relying on the other bank to carry out the verification procedures such as identifying the customer, determining the real owners, and monitoring such transactions for risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, these banking relationships can pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks. This is particularly true with cross-border correspondent banking relationships. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will impose more stringent obligations on Australian banks by requiring them to conduct appropriate due diligence on correspondent banking relationships to ensure that its correspondent banks are not doing business with shell banks and have robust AML/CTF systems and controls. This represents international best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, this Bill reforms cross border reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The movement of cash and other valuable items across borders is a common money laundering and terrorism financing method. Criminals move cash and valuables across borders to launder funds, pay for illicit goods, use illicit funds to purchase assets, and to hide proceeds of crime from authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, travellers into and out of Australia must declare all cross-border movements of physical currency of $10,000 or more. The Bill expands this requirement so that, in addition to physical currency, bearer negotiable instruments, such as travellers' cheques, must also be declared at the border where the combined amount is $10,000 or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also increases the penalties for failing to comply with cross-border declaration requirements to further deter bulk cash smuggling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will bring Australia's regime into alignment with other comparable regimes across the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Bill also modernises secrecy and access provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the global fight against organised crime and terrorism, it is crucial that our national security, law enforcement and revenue protection agencies can efficiently and effectively access and use valuable financial intelligence in performing their functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AUSTRAC information often plays a crucial role in the work of these agencies. For example, in the 2017-18 financial year, AUSTRAC data contributed to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$26.67 million in savings from increased detection of welfare fraud; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$208.8 million in income tax assessments; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">$207.4 million recovered in tax liabilities; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the seizure of 1.2 tonnes of methamphetamine with an estimated street value of over $1 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will make important changes to the 'secrecy and access' provisions in the AML/CTF Act which establish a framework for the access, disclosure and use of financial information held by AUSTRAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed reforms will put in place a simplified and streamlined regime to ensure the secrecy obligations are more clearly and readily understood, and the potential for inconsistency and ambiguity between provisions is minimised. These changes will enhance the Government's ability to deepen collaborative approaches to investigating money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms will also ensure the regime for sharing AUSTRAC information keeps pace with new, more collaborative approaches to investigating these crimes, for example, in partnership with the private sector and through multiagency taskforces. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms in the Bill are accompanied by appropriate safeguards and protections around the handling of sensitive information held by AUSTRAC. This includes a new power to set conditions on the access, disclosure and use of AUSTRAC information to reflect particular sensitivities of the information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Criminal enterprises are not confined by national borders and exploit differences between jurisdictions to prevent detection. Recognising this, the Bill seeks to better equip reporting entities operating in a globalised environment to manage their exposure to transnational crime risks. It does this by enabling them to share information about money laundering and terrorism financing risks in relation to customers with appropriately regulated foreign members of a corporate group and designated business group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will enable businesses to more effectively manage money laundering and terrorism financing risks within their business structure and across jurisdictions in relation to risks posed by shared customers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that the privacy of customers is protected, the Bill also imposes additional safeguards that ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information is maintained and that the information will only be used for the purpose for which it is provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also seeking to strengthen money laundering offences in the Criminal Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is well known that police use undercover operations to investigate serious offending, such as large-scale money laundering syndicates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, where police supply cash to a money laundering syndicate as part of an authorised undercover operation, the would-be money launderers cannot be prosecuted because, technically, the money laundered is not the proceeds of crime, despite what the would-be money launderer may have believed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This technicality should not be the reason why criminals escape prosecution. The Bill rectifies this anomaly through changes to the Criminal Code to clarify that cash used in undercover operations is considered "proceeds of crime" for the purpose of Commonwealth money laundering offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The final measure in the Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Federal Police Act </span>to make it an offence for a person to dishonestly represent that a police award has been conferred on them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to recognise and celebrate the bravery and heroism of police officers who put their lives on the line every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The introduction of this offence will preserve the significant honour associated with receiving a police award and recognise the outstanding contribution these individuals make to their country. We must not let this contribution be devalued by imposters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I urge Senators to support the passage of this important legislation, which will further harden our financial sector against money laundering and terrorism financing and empower our law enforcement agencies to better detect it and prosecute those responsible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, this Bill represents an important next step in the Morrison Government's commitment to reducing the burden of red tape on our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Chamber.</span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has now been over 25 years since the High Court of Australia's historic decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mabo v Queensland (No 2)</span> [1992] HCA 23 and the passage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Native Title Act 1993</span>. The native title system has entered a period of maturity, with most legal issues relating to determination of native title claims settled and native title agreement-making now a recognised and normal part of "doing business on land" in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through the collective efforts of all parties in the native title system, significant progress has been made in resolving claims for the recognition of native title. There are now more native title determinations than active claims on foot - as of June 2019, the National Native Title Tribunal's website reports there have been 465 determinations of native title compared to 268 claim applications on foot. The status of native title has been determined over approximately 42.3% of Australia's land mass, with another 22.3% subject to a native title claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As at June 2019, according to the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations, known as ORIC, there are 202 registered native title bodies corporate - or RNTBCs - being the Indigenous corporations that hold native title once it has been determined, operating across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While these statistics indicate the native title legislative framework is broadly operating well, there are a number of challenges this Bill seeks to address. In particular, the Bill seeks to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of native title claims resolution and agreement-making, and to support the sustainable management of native title land post-determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also supports other Australian Government objectives around native title, including the aspiration to resolve all native title claims existing at June 2015 by 2025 and initiatives to activate the economic potential of land rights under the '<span style="font-style:italic;">Our North, Our Future: White Paper on Developing Northern Australia</span>'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will implement a number of recommendations from recent reviews of native title, including:</span>

The Government received over 50 submissions on the options paper and conducted over 40 stakeholder meetings across the country. Exposure draft legislation, released for public comment on 29 October 2018, was carefully developed in consultation with stakeholders across the native title system. That draft legislation received a further 36 submissions from stakeholders.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also as a matter of urgency confirm the validity of agreements made under section 31 of the Native Title Act in light of the Full Federal Court of Australia's decision in <span style="font-style:italic;">McGlade</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>Section 31 agreements are a particular kind of native title agreement which relate to the grant of mining and exploration rights over land which may be subject to native title, and the compulsory acquisition of native title.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government took decisive action to ensure the validity of Indigenous Land Use Agreements through the amendments in 2017<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>there is a significant risk that the issue raised by the <span style="font-style:italic;">McGlade </span>decision similarly affects section 31 agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The validity of section 31 agreements was not confirmed as part of the 2017 amendments because stakeholders wanted more time to consider this issue and its potential impact. Following the process of extensive consultation on this Bill, there is widespread native title sector support for the validation of these agreements, and the proposed validation mechanism in this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, Schedule 9 of the Bill will seek to confirm the validity of section 31 agreements where not all members of the native title party (also known as the 'applicant') have entered into the agreement. <span style="font-style:italic;">McGlade</span> held that it is necessary for all members of this group to enter into an agreement, even if a single member was unwilling or unable to sign the agreement (including because the person was deceased).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the proposed amendments, section 31 agreements entered into prior to the commencement of this amending Bill will be validated, provided that at least one member of each relevant native title party is a party to the agreement. These amendments will provide certainty to Indigenous and non-Indigenous parties who have already concluded these agreements, including by protecting any resulting benefits and interests agreed to by the parties.</span>

The efficient and effective operation of the Native Title Act's agreement-making processes is also critical to native title claimants and holders obtaining economic benefit from native title.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 6 also includes an amendment to require the Native Title Registrar to keep a public record of section 31 agreements. This measure responds to stakeholder feedback received through consultation on the Bill for there to be greater transparency around the making of these agreements. Currently, parties to a section 31 agreement are required to give a copy of the agreement to the National Native Title Tribunal, but the Tribunal has no power to do anything with it. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will remove the discretion of directors to refuse membership where an applicant meets the eligibility requirements and has applied for membership in the required manner, and will require native title corporations to align their membership criteria with the native title determination. The reforms also limit the grounds for cancelling membership to those provided for under the CATSI Act.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">According to statistics held by ORIC, native title corporations are subject to a relatively large number of disputes about how the corporation is managing the native title.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Native title disputes, in particular between native title corporations and native title holders, impact on corporation governance and the ability of the corporations to fulfil their obligations. Disputes also impact the ability of native title holders to exercise their native title rights. This package of reforms aims to improve the way disputes are handled in future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in Schedule 8 to the Bill require native title corporations to include a process in their rule books for resolving disputes with native title holders. Currently rule books are only required to include a dispute resolution clause relating to the internal operation of the corporation. This reform ensures corporations have procedures to address disputes with native title holders, whether or not they are members of the corporation, and aims to resolve disputes early and internally, before the corporation needs to obtain costly legal advice or the dispute escalates. The process would be designed by the corporation to meet their needs and circumstances.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments clarify that the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations may place a native title corporation under special administration where it has seriously or repeatedly failed to comply with its obligations under native title legislation. Examples of this conduct may include failing to consult with and obtain the consent of native title holders for certain decisions, or failing to act in accordance with the directions of native title holders where there is a significant consequence for native title holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To further support dispute resolution pathways, the Bill introduces a new requirement that certain matters arising under the CATSI Act that relate to native title corporations must be instituted in the Federal Court. This reform recognises the specialist expertise of the Federal Court to resolve disputes relating to native title.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, Schedule 7 to the Bill will provide the National Native Title Tribunal with a new function to provide direct assistance to native title corporations and native title holders to promote agreement about native title-related issues. Under the current law, the Tribunal can only provide assistance in relation to intra-Indigenous disputes when invited by a native title representative body or service provider to do so.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  Prior to the debate being interrupted I made the point that when the government announced that the Centrelink office at Abbotsford would be closed, thanks to strong community pressure, the government backflipped on the decision to close the office. The government had announced the closure during the pandemic, at a time when people were very reliant on Centrelink for JobSeeker payments et cetera. This would have been a dangerous move for the community, who would have had to travel an additional seven kilometres to the next office. Another planned closure, at Mornington, was recently postponed until March next year. We think that the government has its priorities wrong. Why would the government close Centrelink offices at a time when the number of people needing income support has skyrocketed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this month <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> reported that Australians visiting Centrelink offices waited 30 per cent longer, on average, in the past financial year compared to 2015-16. The analysis also revealed that people living in major cities waited about five minutes longer, on average, than in 2015-16, while those in regional centres waited about four minutes longer when seeking help. Wouldn't shutting Centrelink offices and call centres result in even longer wait times? We also need to recognise that not everybody can access services online. Face-to-face services are vital to helping people to get the services they need in our communities, including older people and people with low literacy and digital skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The danger of Centrelink staff being mostly casuals on contracts became very clear recently. Last month, Serco, a contractor for Centrelink call centres, announced that it would be cutting 420 Centrelink call centre staff from centres in Dandenong and Mill Park. These positions should not have been outsourced or casualised in the first place. These job losses clearly demonstrate the dangers of contracting for-profit providers to deliver essential government services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem identified by stakeholders, including Economic Justice Australia, is the limited number of Centrelink social workers. People often report they have to wait two or three days to access support from Centrelink social workers, which can be very critical timing for people who are desperately in need. There is a genuine need for Centrelink offices to have a social worker unit that is staffed at appropriate levels. We have also seen recent criticism of Services Australia in the way the agency has been implementing some new IT systems, as detailed in the recently released ANAO report. I will continue to follow up implementation of the commitments that Centrelink made in response to that report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that, as an executive agency, Services Australia can now learn from its mistakes and in future deliver strong social services to Australians who interact with our social safety net. Particularly as we move forward, addressing and coming out of the pandemic, people are going to need, and do need, a strong social safety net and a strong agency that is there for them—an agency that is not there to punish and demonise, or implement an agenda that demonises people on our income support system. We need an agency that is there for the people who need it and delivers the services and supports that are needed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  Labor support the Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020. We will always support modifications to public sector governance structures that lead to good outcomes for employees and the Australians that rely on those services. This bill, however, does nothing about the biggest driver of bad outcomes for Public Service workers and the provision of services to Australians that Australians should be relying upon—that is, the government's entirely arbitrary staffing cap that leads to the under-resourcing of the public sector and an over-reliance on labour hire to keep up with demand as well as an exorbitant overspend on outsourcing and consultants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From dealing with the Black Summer bushfire response in January to managing the surge in new applicants for JobSeeker as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, staff at Services Australia are managing a growing workload. Over 20 times the normal number of claims are being processed. In six weeks Services Australia received a million claims for JobSeeker related payments—more claims than it would usually process in a year. That workload will no doubt only increase as Australia's recession deepens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes the government's long-overdue decision back in March to bring in an additional 5,000 workers at Services Australia to deal with the workload. But we should be under no illusion as to why this has been done and the significance of how these additional workers were hired. Bringing in an additional 5,000 staff was only putting back what the Liberals and Nationals had cut from the front line over the past six years. That has undermined the services that they are supposed to be providing. I will speak more about that a little bit later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did the government find 5,000 new staff in March? The answer is labour hire and outsourcing. After wielding the axe on almost 5,000 permanent full-time secure APS jobs over six years they replaced those positions with workers in insecure work arrangements working for labour hire companies and companies like Serco. So 3,125 employees came through labour hire and 2,103 employees came through outsourced so-called service delivery partners such as Serco, a multinational tax dodger—who else would you employ to employ people in such an important service for the country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their ideological war on Public Service workers in secure work, the government saw fit to take 5,000 secure APS, Australian community jobs over six years from this critical agency. Then, overnight, when the crisis hit, they replaced them but without the conditions and security that used to come with these positions. Surely everyone can agree that having secure work makes a difference—particularly in the face of significant economic downturn, when Australians are relying on these vital public services more than ever. Yet the coalition has cut the size of the Australian Public Service to figures around 2006-07 staffing levels. Regardless of how much work needs to be done, agencies like Services Australia are forced to arbitrarily limit their staff. The cap on hiring permanent staff forces them to outsource jobs and hire through labour hire agreements, at exorbitant costs to the Australian taxpayer. It is privatisation by stealth, with more than $400 million spent on privatising Services Australia call centres in 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken in this place before about the many issues with insecure work. Its impact on workers and their families and the broader community is well-known. Across this country only 60 per cent of workers are in full-time or part-time ongoing employment. The rest, around four million workers, are engaged as casuals, on short-term contracts in labour hire or as independent contractors without rights. The result is an emerging class of workers without jobs they can count on. They have no sick leave, no holidays, no job security, of course little bargaining power and a severely reduced capacity to get home loans. Those issues are only exasperated during a health and economic crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Staff working under labour hire arrangements in the Public Service, including at Services Australia across most of the country, did not have access to paid pandemic leave, and still don't now. This means that they face severe financial hardship if required to isolate now or into the future. On principle, no worker should be faced with a choice between following public health guidance or being able to put food on the table. Forcing workers to make such a choice undermines our solidarity and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our community response is undermined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, as the largest employer in the country, should be leading by example and providing pandemic leave to all workers. Instead, these positions are managed by Serco. In July about 450 staff at the Serco-run Centrelink call centre in north-east Melbourne were stood down and sent into isolation without pay due to an outbreak connected with the centre. Serco have been repeatedly warned since March about the unsafe work environment and a lack of physical distancing and other COVID-safe protocols. An anonymous worker said that many workers didn't have time to clean their desk because they were only paid for the time they were clocked on via a computer system. One went on to say: 'At every stage they resisted doing things like proper distancing at training sessions, where there were 30 people in a room every day. We've been providing a valuable service to people calling Centrelink during the recession, but our own lives have been put at risk.' That an Australian worker providing vital services would be treated in this way is an absolute disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The insecure work at Services Australia also clearly affects the quality of the services provided. The ramping up of insecure work because of the staff cap means an increasing reliance on these outsourced call centres run by Serco. These companies do not deliver for the Australian taxpayer or those doing it tough. We know that outsourcing and understaffing has seen as many as 55 million calls to Services Australia going unanswered every year—55 million calls mean a lot of frustrated Australians, Australians who could be facing some pretty trying times, like having their homes and livelihoods destroyed by fire or losing their income because they've lost their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Greg, who is an ex-staff member at Services Australia, including a stint at the Coffs Harbour call centre, points out that a Centrelink recipient may be able to get through to Serco-managed call centres in 16 minutes, but then they speak to someone at Serco who cannot actually answer their question so they get put on the line and they wait an hour-and-a-half or two hours so they can speak to a government employee. This is an incredibly cyclical way of extracting profit from an essential public service and it fools people into thinking that someone is adequately addressing important issues in a time-sensitive way when all Serco provides is a statistical fig leaf for the government. Quite simply, there is more value to the Australian taxpayer through employing staff directly to Services Australia without spending on unnecessary or expensive labour hire that doesn't provide staff with the training. It's completely unfair and unnecessary to have two workers doing identical work but receiving different pay, conditions and training because one is lucky enough to have direct APS employment while the other is contracted by a labour hire agency. Outsourcing to companies like Serco is privatisation by stealth, and it must end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should listen to unions like the Community and Public Sector Union. A recent CPSU survey of Services Australia staff reveals that, while most of them feel valued by the community, nearly three in four felt the government did not properly recognise or value their role. If your work was being outsourced to a company like Serco, you would probably feel the same way. As fellow servants of the public, as senators, we should stand up better for the Public Service. The government's arbitrary staffing cap undermines the quality of services provided for Australians and devalues the essential work of our Public Service.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  [by video link] Services Australia was established as an executive agency in February this year. The agency was previously the Department of Human Services and the transition from department to executive agency requires the legislative changes in the Services Australia Governance Amendment Bill 2020. The bill also amends multiple references in legislation to the former department and its secretary. This bill also amends several acts to specify that the CEO of Services Australia is the chief executive of Centrelink, the chief executive of Medicare and the Child Support Registrar. Given Services Australia's broad service delivery functions and the overall responsibility of the CEO for the operations of the agency, the government no longer considers it necessary for these offices to have different occupants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports sensible changes which improve Public Service governance arrangements and, in turn, lead to better service delivery for the millions of Australia's who rely on these services. But, when it comes to the issues facing Services Australia in delivering timely and quality services, this government is merely scratching the surface. The fact is that this government has been chipping away at the agency's capacity to support Australians ever since its savage cuts in the 2014 budget. This is an agency which deals with some of Australia's most vulnerable people, often in their time of greatest need. If Services Australia isn't receiving the funding it needs to properly support its customers then it is the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of our society who will suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Erosions in services for students, families, older Australians, jobseekers, people with disability and their carers, and a range of other Australians is what we have come to expect from Liberal governments, which simply see these people as a burden. The vulnerable Australians who rely on the government for income support are those who former Treasurer Joe Hockey referred to as 'leaners' or, to coin a phrase from our current Prime Minister, they are the ones not having a go and therefore not getting a go. These philosophical pronouncements outline the Liberal world view that every individual is responsible for their own success or failure in life regardless of their background or circumstances, that helping those less fortunate is a role for charity and not the responsibility of the state. That's why the Liberals are the party that promote cuts to pension, have cut the NDIS and continue to engage in rhetoric about cracking down on what they see as dole bludgers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the kind of attitude that last year led to that selective leaking of JobSeeker compliance data to News Limited papers a day before it was published on the department's website. Whoever leaked the data must have known that the Murdoch media would use headlines that would help feed the perception of jobseekers as lazy freeloaders. The Murdoch papers delivered in spades with headlines like 'Doling out the excuses', 'It's a hard day's shirk' and 'New stats reveal the extent of bludging'. The articles quoted statistics about the number of missed interviews and suspended payments. But if the so-called journalists who wrote the articles were doing their jobs they might have looked in more depth at the reasons behind those statistics. Did they stop to consider that for many jobseekers, particularly those experiencing multiple forms of disadvantage, there might be a more complex picture at play? Did they bother to ask for a comment from the welfare sector instead of simply providing a platform for the government's jobseeker-bashing rhetoric? It was a brazen attempt to demonise jobseekers, no doubt perpetuated by those opposite. It is a sad reflection on the professionalism and integrity of some in the media that journalists and editors allowed themselves to be complicit in this outrageous smear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I placed a series of questions on notice in the following round of Senate estimates to get to the bottom of whether the minister for employment had authorised the leak or investigated the leak and why data was given exclusively to Murdoch papers ahead of its official publication. In answer to a long series of detailed questions I got a single sentence in reply, stating, 'The data has been tabled and is available on the APH employment, skills, small and family business website.' Call me old-fashioned, but when someone deliberately avoids answering a question I think it usually means they have something to hide. If the minister leaked the data or authorised the leak, I challenge her to come clean. We all recognise it wouldn't be the first politically motivated leak to come from a minister's office and, if she didn't authorise it, I challenge her to have the leak investigated. Unlike those opposite, Labor believe every Australian has the right to a social safety net. If you don't believe in that right, like those opposite, then you will not—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise to support the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2020. The purpose of the bill is to introduce a number of technical and administrative amendments that go to compliance and the sharing of information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the measures in this bill is to put beyond doubt that an offence is to Services Australia generally, not just to a particular officer of the agency. This change is proposed in the context of online service delivery, where an officer may not actually be providing the information. It will also require a person served with a formal notice or summonsed by a royal commission to produce documents or information, or to give evidence, to comply with that requirement. It will require this, even if the document or information is protected by secrecy provisions in social security and related law. This will ensure that the Department of Social Services and related agencies will participate fully in the disability royal commission and future royal commissions. The change will put the department in the same position as any other person served with a requirement by a royal commission under the Royal Commission Act. The bill will also make a range of technical amendments to correct errors and anomalies and to repeal obsolete provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor supports these changes, all Australians will never forget the government's dismal record when it comes to social security. This is the government which has previously sought to make it so painful and so difficult for Australians to access income support that they just give up. And I want to take a brief moment to note in this place a number of developments we have learned through Senate estimates in relation to our social security system. We've learned that the number of people on unemployment payments will surge to 1.8 million by December. This is an increase of 300,000 on previous projections. In four years time, that figure is expected to remain at almost one million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With so many Australians on unemployment support, and more expected to lose their jobs, it is simply unfair and unreasonable for the government to be cutting the coronavirus supplement, for the second time, at Christmas. For all of its demonisation of social security recipients, the government forgets that they spend at their local and small businesses. It means that local and small businesses have more to spend on wages and jobs. Labor reiterate our call for the government to provide a permanent increase to the base rate of unemployment support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I rise to offer Labor's support to this important legislation, which will make a substantial difference in the lives of parents who have experienced the tragedy of stillbirth. The principle effect of the Fair Work Amendment (Improving Unpaid Parental Leave for Parents of Stillborn Babies and Other Measures) Bill 2020 will be to provide the same unpaid parental leave entitlements to parents who experience stillbirth as any other parent. As we know, through hearing the many tragic stories from parents who have lived through this difficult and painful experience, they are parents too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will make a significant difference to Australian families, particularly those parents and families who experience stillbirths—six families each day. However, while this bill makes a difference in respect to unpaid parental leave, it only partly addresses the bipartisan recommendation of the Senate select committee on stillbirth. The committee recommended that laws be changed to ensure that paid parental leave is provided to parents of stillborn babies, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector. So, while the government's changes on unpaid parental leave are welcome and positive, there is still unfinished business for parents of stillborn babies in relation to guaranteed equal access to parental leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators who were part of the Senate select committee should be congratulated for this outcome, particularly Senators McCarthy, Keneally and Bilyk. Once more I echo the comments made by the shadow minister in the other place and express my sincere appreciation to all those organisations who have worked tirelessly to get to where we are today. Lastly, I pay tribute to all the parents who have shared their sad and very personal stories of stillbirth, including the parliamentarians in this place. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  [by video link] Thanks for the opportunity to be able to say a few words about the Fair Work Amendment (Improving Unpaid Parental Leave for Parents of Stillborn Babies and Other Measures) Bill 2020 today. This bill is long overdue, but it's welcome. It's one of several legislative changes that the government is making which improve support for parents of stillborn babies. Yesterday I was pleased to also see the passage of the legislation which brought stillborn baby payments to second and subsequent stillbirths into line with those for a first stillbirth. That bill also extended the family tax benefit part A bereavement payment to parents of stillborn babies and of babies who die before their first birthday. Labor has been pressing the government to make those changes and the changes in this bill for some time, so of course we're pleased to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's taken decades to properly recognise the needs of families of stillborn babies, possibly because of the misunderstanding of the profound impact it has on them. It is a deeply painful experience. The grief of this tragedy, which is borne by 2,200 Australian families every year—or six a day, as Senator Brown mentioned—can be just as profound as the grief experienced after the loss of any other child. I understand this as the parent of a stillborn baby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been 37 years since I gave birth to Timmy, and I still grieve his loss, as does my husband and my family. To try to get some sense of what this experience is like for a birth mother, just imagine that you've been through something like five to nine months of pregnancy. After all the body and hormonal changes from pregnancy, you then go through childbirth, an experience which one-in-three women, according to surveys, find traumatic anyway. After this exhausting journey, instead of the joy of a healthy baby, you're left with a profound feeling of grief, loss and emptiness. Your hopes of being a mother and a father are shattered, your arms are empty and your dreams for the future of your child are absolutely shattered. While you are going through this profound grief, you're also faced with all sorts of heart-wrenching decisions about funeral arrangements and whether to have an autopsy and the expenses that go with all of that. I will say that, 37 years ago, there were no payments available for parents that had stillborn babies, and it was so traumatic for my husband and I to have to deal with all of that. Then there's the decision of having to face whether you return to work too soon after an experience like that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A PricewaterhouseCoopers report, commissioned by the Stillbirth Foundation, found that stillbirth cost the economy $681 million over the past five years, so it's of little surprise that much of that cost—a bit over 40 per cent—was due to absenteeism and the loss of productivity of parents of stillborn babies who had to return to work before they were ready. As the Stillbirth Foundation stated when they welcomed this legislation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parents of stillborn babies are parents too, and six weeks is not enough time to grieve the loss of their babies, let alone recover from all of the physical side effects of pregnancy and birth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as improving unpaid leave provisions for parents of stillborn babies, this legislation, importantly, removes the provision that allows employers to recall employees on unpaid parental leave or cancel any upcoming planned period of unpaid parental leave. This applies to leave for which the employee has given notice if their child is stillborn or dies within the first 24 months of life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the changes to unpaid leave are welcome, there is also work to be done to bring paid parental leave for parents with stillborn babies into line with those for other parents. This was a key recommendation of the Senate stillbirth inquiry. A number of private companies have already done this, extending the entitlements to around half a million workers. These companies have recognised the extraordinary impact of stillbirth and have gone above and beyond the minimum standards in supporting their workers through this tragedy. Sadly, there are millions of other workers who, if they experience a stillbirth, will not have access to this entitlement. While those workers can access unpaid leave, they may face the unenviable choice between losing their income and returning to work too early, all while they are still dealing with that incredible grief and trying to make decisions about their baby's funeral. I'm really disappointed that the government did not support our second reading amendment in the House and that they've failed to acknowledge the incredible stress that this puts families experiencing stillbirth under. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank all senators who participated in the stillbirth Senate inquiry. My heartfelt thanks go to my Labor colleagues Senator Keneally and Senator McCarthy, who have been strong advocates for these changes as well. We've also been strongly supported by the shadow minister for health, Mr Chris Bowen. As I said, as the parent of a stillborn baby, I absolutely urge senators to support this bill. </span>

I particularly want to thank Senator Bilyk for her braveness and courage in speaking so openly about her experience, Senator Keneally for her work in initiating the inquiry and Senator McCarthy for chairing that inquiry, which I was very privileged to be part of. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note the importance and the significance of the Senate process in getting to this stage—having that Senate inquiry that was initiated by hearing the stories of families right across the country and hearing that there were solutions. You cannot take away the tragedy of losing an unborn child, but at least there are things that can be done to support the families who are suffering the tragedy of stillbirth. There are things that can be done to reduce the frequency of stillbirths, and then there are things that can be done to support the families afterwards. These recommendations were made from that Senate inquiry, and it is so satisfying now to see some of them being reflected in legislation. So I want to note that this is a really good example of the Senate working well to achieve legislation that is really going to change the lives of families across Australia.</span>

The government is pleased to be delivering on its commitment to provide improved support for families who experience stillbirth or death of a child in the first 24 months and to be introducing much-needed flexibility into the unpaid parental leave provisions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Amendment (Improving Unpaid Parental Leave for Parents of Stillborn Babies and Other Measures) Bill 2020 marks an important step in unpaid parental leave entitlements, which are just as important during the COVID-19 pandemic as they were before. These are sensible and measured reforms. While continuing to implement the specific measures to support families impacted by COVID-19, the government is progressing these important reforms to unpaid parental leave as part of our ongoing commitment to parents and families. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments in the bill are compassionate reforms that will provide parents with more support and clarity around their unpaid parental leave entitlements where they experience a stillbirth or the death of a child in the first two years of life, ensuring these parents can take the leave they had planned to take. The amendments in the bill are sensible reforms that will provide parents with more flexibility when their baby is hospitalised following birth, and when making decisions about how to organise work and caring commitments. The measures in the bill are an important package of reforms that provide parents with improved support, greater choice and flexibility to combine care and work responsibilities.</span>

Once again this government dithers and delays on genuine reform when industry is crying out for the uncertainty to end. Labor will not oppose this bill. We won't stand in the way of relatively minor regulatory amendments to alleviate regulatory burden on regional broadcasters, particularly in the face of concerns about the market failure of regional commercial television, but we are concerned that regional Australians are missing out as a result of this government's ongoing failure to support regional media.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill permits greater flexibility for regional commercial radio broadcasting licensees in satisfying their local content obligation, with minor amendments to the local content requirements and associated reporting requirements. Importantly, the bill will not lower the amount of local content that is currently available to regional audiences on commercial radio.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill permits regional commercial television broadcasting licensees to be deemed to have complied with the multichannel transmission quota obligation, even if they have not broadcast the required 1,460 hours of Australian content, if the amount of content on the multichannels they do carry, under affiliation agreements, is not less than the amount of Australian content on the equivalent metropolitan multichannels. This will assist certain regional and remote licensees from failing to satisfy the obligation as a result of programming decisions beyond their control by their metro affiliates. The bill will not directly reduce the amount of Australian content available to regional viewers, but does permit a reduction in overall hours of Australian content broadcast by regional broadcasters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill says it all about this government's failure on regional media in Australia: it is late, it is inadequate, and it sells regional Australia short. The bill is late because it addresses an issue the government has known about since 2017, at least. The department considers this issue to be an early warning sign of market failure in regional commercial television broadcasting, yet the government is only just getting around to addressing it now. The bill is inadequate because it merely tinkers with a few provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act when a coherent, holistic and strategic package, including a wholesale reform of the policy and regulatory framework, is necessary—a fact that this government has known since it took office in 2013.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sells regional Australia short, because it assumes that where broadcasters face challenges in meeting Australian content requirements, the answer is to relax the content requirements rather than assist broadcasters in bridging the gap somehow or to undertake genuine reform to address structural challenges. The bill makes it clear that regional media is facing challenges, partly as a result of this government's failure to keep the regulatory framework up-to-date, and regional Australians are missing out as a result.</span>

The bill will amend the local content framework for commercial radio licensees to reduce the regulatory burden on regional licensees. It will also amend the Australian content multichannel quota so that regional commercial television licensees are not left in the position of failing to satisfy their regulatory requirements due to programming decisions beyond their control. The bill amends a number of provisions within the local content framework for regional commercial radio licensees, providing licensees with greater flexibility in complying with the framework. These amendments are relevant to the material of local significance and the minimum service standard obligations.</span>

The bill increases the flexibility of the local content exemption period by allowing licensees to split their exemption period to cover multiple holiday periods and by allowing licensees to self-nominate their own exemption periods. The amendment will make the exemption period more efficient for licensees as well as reducing the regulatory burden associated with the local content exemption period provisions. The bill will also remove public holidays from the minimum service standards obligation. Material that must be broadcast under the minimum service standards can also be used to acquit the material of the local significance obligation. However, licensees are not required to broadcast material of local significance on public holidays. Therefore the bill seeks to better align the two obligations by removing the requirement to broadcast the minimum service standards on public holidays.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will remove the requirement for licensees to publish local content plans, which detail how licensees propose to meet the minimum service standards. Local content plans place significant regulatory burden on licensees, but often provide minimal support to increase levels of local content to regional areas. Therefore, the bill will propose that licensees instead use a local content statement, which they must develop after the material of local significance requirement. Local content statements are more streamlined than local content plans, and this change will significantly reduce the burden under the local content framework. The bill will also remove the statutory review provision for the local content framework. The statutory review is considered to be unnecessary, given the ongoing focus on the local content framework on a routine basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the area of regional and remote commercial television licensees, the bill proposes to insert a deeming provision with the effect that licensees are deemed to have complied with the multichannel obligation. This deeming provision will only apply if licensees broadcast the same amount of Australian content on each multichannel they carry as their metropolitan affiliate has broadcast. It takes account of the current realities of delivering multichannel content in regional and remote Australia, noting that it is becoming more commercially unsustainable for regional and remote licensees to carry the full suite of multichannels. The bill provides an important reduction in the regulatory burden for regional commercial radio licensees and regional and remote commercial televisions licensees. It will amend the local content framework to make regulatory compliance easier for licensees. I thank senators for their support and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

In November last year, the shadow minister for education and training wrote to the minister, asking him to consider exactly these changes. Labor has voiced our concern that the exclusion of domestic upfront-fee-paying students from the tuition protection scheme would create a complex situation where different students have different rights and protections. It may have taken nearly 10 months, but we are pleased that the government has legislated to tie up these loose ends. We welcome the practical effect of the legislation to create simpler arrangements for students and processes for decision-making, student placement and loan recrediting. We commend these bills to the Senate.</span>

The bills enable Australia's unique and successful tuition protection arrangements to be extended to cover domestic students who pay their tuition fees for their studies upfront. This will ensure these students receive the same government-backed protections and assistance as students who accessed Commonwealth assistance loans to fund their studies—that is, support through either a replacement unit or course to continue their studies or a refund of their tuition fees for incomplete units of study where their provider has failed to deliver.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Higher Education (Up-front Payments Tuition Protection Levy) Bill 2020 will seek to impose the upfront payments tuition protection levy and prescribe the levy components and the manner in which they will be determined each year. This will enable leviable providers to contribute to a fund rather than maintain their own separate tuition protection arrangements for domestic upfront paying students. These arrangements can often be burdensome for providers to maintain. The new tuition protection arrangements for upfront paying students are consistent with the already proven successful tuition protection model for international students and domestic students who access a Commonwealth loan to support their studies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the education sector. Now more than ever, these bills provide an additional measure of surety to domestic higher education students who are not relying on Commonwealth assistance loans. These students can be assured that they will be assisted through these government-backed tuition protection arrangements in the event that their provider closes or stops teaching a course from 2021. This surety will also encourage people to invest in their higher education and gain the necessary skills and qualifications for employment in their chosen career field, thereby contributing to the future growth of Australia's skilful workforce. I commend the bills to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Supporting the Wellbeing of Veterans and Their Families) Bill 2020 contains three measures aimed at better meeting the needs of veterans and their families. Firstly, the bill amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to create the new position of Veteran Family Advocate on the Repatriation Commission and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to represent the families of veterans. Secondly, it amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to enable the provision of assistance or benefits to former Australian Defence Force members to transition to civilian work. Finally, it amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act to extend the quarterly payment of the energy supplement to holders of gold cards under the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests and British Commonwealth Occupation Force (Treatment) Act 2006 and the Treatment Benefits (Special Access) Act 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor notes, however, that the government has already announced that Ms Gwen Cherne has been appointed as the Veteran Family Advocate to the Repatriation Commission under existing veterans affairs legislation and commenced in the role on 24 August 2020. It seems that the government have a penchant for appointing people before the relevant legislation has been passed. They raced ahead and appointed an interim National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention recently before the enabling legislation had even been debated in the House, much less passed by the parliament. That said, Labor welcomes Ms Cherne's appointment and acknowledges her passion and experience in supporting the ex-service community. We expect she will do a good job representing the perspectives of veteran families in ongoing policy- and decision-making across government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She would know that many veterans and their families are sceptical that the government's proposed national commission for veterans suicide is little more than a marketing exercise designed to placate them. Many believe it's not better than a royal commission, as the government claims, and that it won't accomplish what a royal commission could because it still lacks the independence, powers and resources to ask the hard questions. Labor has continued to call on the government to do the right thing and to announce a full royal commission, with clear start and end dates, so that we can get to the bottom of veteran suicides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the Senate should support better mental health outcomes and suicide prevention for veterans and their families, and Labor supports it. But the best thing that the government could do is to show faith with veterans and their families and commit to establishing a royal commission into veteran suicides so we can tackle this issue once and for all. This legislation supports the wellbeing of veterans, their families and the wider veteran community. Labor supports it, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  The Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment (Supporting the Wellbeing of Veterans and Their Families) Bill 2020 addresses three key issues: it fully implements the government's commitment to create the Veteran Family Advocate, it provides changes to better support the transition from ADF service to civilian employment and it ensures that all recipients of the gold card are treated equally in terms of their benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that in many ways the service of defence families on the home front is just as important as service on the front line. That is why the government has made engagement with veterans' families a priority over successive terms. We have established the Female Veterans and Veterans' Families Policy Forum and the Council for Women and Families United by Defence Service. We have listened to what's working and what needs improvement, and this bill will take our commitment further by establishing the Veteran Family Advocate. I'd like to congratulate Ms Gwen Cherne, who has been appointed as the inaugural Veteran Family Advocate and as a commissioner on the Repatriation Commission. This bill extends that appointment, so Gwen will also be appointed as a commissioner on the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The government cannot solve the complex problems faced by veterans without the assistance of their families. Families understand how a veteran feels at a particular moment—the nature of their challenges and what needs to be done to best support them. By working together, we can achieve better results for our veterans and the families which support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this bill facilitates flexibility in the way programs can be designed to assist the transition from the ADF to the civilian workforce. This government has made significant improvements in transition and employment support. This bill will further support employment by allowing for the establishment of new programs such as the Support for Employment Program through the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Regulations 2020. The regulations will contain the details of the employment assistance or benefits, as well as who they will be provided to and in what circumstances they can be provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their work, and I note their comments in relation to the transition to civilian employment measure. In response, an addendum to the explanatory memorandum has been prepared—which I believe has been tabled—to address concerns by the Senate committee as to why it is most appropriate that details of the Support for Employment Program be placed in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Regulations 2020. Once established through the regulations, this program will provide eligible veterans with both pre- and post-employment assistance. This will ensure that similar employment support is available to veterans for up to five years, as is currently available to transitioning ADF members, including career advice, coaching, assistance with skills translation and resume and interview preparation and coaching to adapt to the structure and communication of civilian employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final part of this bill fixes an unintended omission that has meant the energy supplement has not been payable to some gold card holders because they are covered under different legislation. This government acknowledges the importance of the gold card to the veteran community. This measure builds on our acknowledgement and extends the provisions in the energy supplement to Australia participants in the British nuclear tests and the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and Australian residents who worked as part of Australian surgical medical teams in Vietnam. This ensures that all gold card holders are treated consistently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our veterans were prepared to make great sacrifices when we needed them. As the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant states, 'For what they have done, this we will do'. This supports the wellbeing of veterans, their families and the wider veteran community, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Administration) Bill 2020. This bill makes minor amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to improve administrative processes under Medicare. The bill's main provision is to remove an annual requirement to remake the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Passage of the Legislation Act 2003 made this process redundant because up-to-date versions of all legislative instruments are now published on the Federal Register of Legislation. The government assures us that these minor changes will not impact Medicare patients or providers and they relate solely to government processes, so this bill is uncontroversial and Labor will be supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill does nothing about the bigger problem in Medicare, which is the record out-of-pocket costs. The government's own data shows what Australians already know—that the cost of seeing a doctor has never been higher than under Mr Scott Morrison. The average out-of-pocket fee to see a GP is now $39, up $10, or more than a third, under this government. When the government proposed a $7 GP tax in the 2014 budget, GPs and their patients rightly revolted, but after Labor blocked that increase the government imposed the Medicare freeze. As Treasurer, Mr Scott Morrison personally extended the freeze by two years. Even though the freeze has now ended, it continues to hurt Australians because it has shifted more of the cost of seeing a GP onto patients. The government has now more than achieved its policy intent. It wanted a $7 GP tax and it has presided over a $10 increase. The increase is even worse for visits to specialists. The average specialist out-of-pocket fee is now $88, up a staggering $30, or more than half, under this government. Of course, these are only averages; many patients are forced to pay much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These costs have real impacts, particularly at a time when millions of Australians have lost jobs or income. Even before the Morrison recession, 564,000 Australians a year were forced to delay or avoid seeing a GP because they couldn't afford it. Another 579,000 Australians were forced to skip seeing a specialist. The government's own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that, all told, 1.3 million Australians a year are forced to skip Medicare services. Of course, that burden doesn't fall equally; it hurts some people much more than others. To take one example, people in south-eastern New South Wales in the electorates of Gilmore and Eden-Monaro are twice as likely to skip care as people in northern Sydney. So Labor will support this bill, but we urge the government to admit and address the bigger problems in Medicare, particularly out-of-pocket costs.</span>

These changes do not affect the existing arrangements for patients or health professionals. The bill removes the annual sunset period for the regulations which prescribe the table of medical, diagnostic imaging and pathology services covered by the MBS. This removes the requirement for the Medicare regulations to be remade each year so patients can continue to be eligible to receive benefits through Medicare. This change will reduce unnecessary administrative work and mitigate the risk that an error made during the remake process could affect patient entitlements to benefits under Medicare.</span>

This includes removing references to the establishment and operation of the inactive Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee, removing calculations relating to Medicare benefits which are no longer used and removing references to historical requirements for optometrists, to reflect modern administrative arrangements. I thank senators and commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  [by video link] I would like to reiterate what I said before I was interrupted: Labor believes every Australian has a right to a social safety net. If you don't believe in this right, then you will not invest in the services which underpin it. Services Australia customers know that there has been an erosion in services, because they see the impacts every single day. Nowhere is this starker than for customers of Centrelink. Year on year we hear stories of people waiting 30 minutes, 40 minutes or even hours on the phone trying to get through to Centrelink's national assistance lines. And the number of calls going unanswered by Centrelink is now in the order of 55 million a year—that is, 55 million times when someone has picked up the phone to Centrelink and, instead of waiting on the phone, as I said, for 30 or 40 minutes or maybe an hour or longer to get through, they've received an engaged tone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects of the erosion of services by this government are often felt at a local level too. In 2016, the member for Franklin, Julie Collins, and I had to mount a campaign to maintain face-to face services in Kingston, where my electorate office is based, because the Liberals tried to close the local Centrelink and Medicare office. The closure of the Kingston office would have caused massive difficulties for people in the local area, who would have had to travel to the Hobart office where parking is more difficult to find, particularly for anyone with mobility issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After more than 3,000 residents of the area signed our petition and 300 attended a public meeting, the government did back down and instead co-located the office with Service Tasmania. This was a major win for the community, but it was an outcome celebrated by people who should never have had to fight for it in the first place. The outcome for residents in Kingston and the surrounding suburbs was better than the foreclosure of the office, but it was less than ideal. Service Tasmania's shopfront is simply too small to maintain privacy in a co-located office. Centrelink customers have to discuss sensitive personal issues within earshot of people getting their drivers licence renewed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You'd think that those opposite would have learnt from the backlash that they received over attempts to close the Kingston office, but they were at it again when they applied the co-location model to another office in Huonville. Co-location followed a gradual reduction in services at the Huonville office, including when Services Australia reduced the number of staff from three to two, in 2017. Both the staff reduction in 2017 and the co-location in 2020 prompted a number of concerned calls to both my office and that of Ms Collins. Unfortunately, the government failed to listen to the community once again, and the co-location at Huonville has gone ahead. This government either doesn't understand or doesn't care that people need face-to-face services. Not everyone has access to the internet or enough confidence to use it in all their dealings with Centrelink, even when Centrelink's online services are working. And, as I mentioned earlier, the phone services are notoriously difficult to access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if people can use internet and phone services, I believe people have a right to deal with Centrelink in the manner that suits them. I've heard stories of other Services Australia shopfronts that had been slated for closure only to have the government backflip on their decision. Even when these closure decisions are reversed, communities still face great angst over the prospect of losing their local Centrelink or Medicare office and, when it is saved, they usually end up with a diminished service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other consequences to the government's erosion of Services Australia. It's worth speculating what may have come of the robodebt debacle had the resources been allocated to apply more human oversight to the system. The mess that the government mired themselves in through the automated debt recovery program is a cautionary tale about how cutting costs leads to cutting corners and, in turn, cutting corners can cause monumental mistakes to be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's ironic that in their efforts to save taxpayers' money through the robodebt system the government has ended up costing taxpayers substantially more. When they were finally forced to pay back all the $721 million they'd illegally extorted from Australian social security recipients, all that was left to show for the system were hundreds of millions of dollars in costs. It defies logic. It really defies logic. Up to July last year, the government had already spent $400 million on that flawed system. They've since thrown more money out the window, including $34 million in legal expenses fighting the largest class action in Australia's history. More of this cost could have been avoided if they'd applied more oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As if the difficulties for Australians who rely on Services Australia weren't bad enough already, the situation has been made even worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March this year we saw queues outside several Centrelink offices stretching for hundreds of metres around the block and the myGov website crash due to overwhelming command. This led to the bizarre situation where the minister claimed that the website had suffered a distributed-denial-of-service attack, only to have to retract that statement hours later and admit that the site was unable to cope with the influx of newly unemployed people trying to apply for payments. The Morrison government knew well in advance that the pandemic was going to lead to a rush on Centrelink services, but they failed to provide for it. This will go down in history as one of a number of failures in the handling of the pandemic by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the pandemic there have been as many new JobSeeker claims received in 55 days as Services Australia would usually deal with over a 2½-year period. That number includes 280,000 people who sought help from the agency in just one day. One in eight of these new applicants also had to apply for a Centrelink reference number, meaning it was the first time in their life they had needed to seek government income support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 5,000 new workers the government announced they would engage in March were sorely needed to manage the additional demand created by the COVID-19 pandemic, but, unfortunately, it is the same number of workers that have been cut from the agency over the past six years. Eventually the government engaged a total of 14,800 extra staff, including through labour hire agencies, direct engagement with Services Australia and redeployment from across the APS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's post-COVID economic recovery will be slow, and the higher demand for JobSeeker payments is unlikely to disappear soon. If those opposite really want to improve the quality and services delivered by Services Australia, particularly through the pandemic, then a useful solution would be to abolish the agency's staffing cap. The cap on staffing levels makes no sense whatsoever. It doesn't actually limit the number of employees working for the agency; it simply limits the number who are employed directly. The staffing cap forces the agency to turn to expensive external consultants and labour hire agencies to do work that should be done by Public Service employees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July last year it was reported that Services Australia had entered into a massive $881 million worth of labour hire contracts over the previous two financial years. The Minister for Human Services at the time, Minister Keenan, relied on a KPMG report to back this massive outsourcing effort, but he refused to release the report, because of cabinet confidentiality. All this privatisation and outsourcing doesn't help contain the agency's costs. It doesn't improve its services. It doesn't help the agency retain long-serving employees with knowledge and experience. In fact, I'd argue that in all three cases it does the opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does this nonsensical policy achieve? If anything, it helps the Morrison government in their ideological war against workers. The use of outsourcing, contracting and labour hire is a back-door avenue to undermining wages and conditions when those opposite can't slash the pay and conditions of public servants. This has led to a situation where two workers may work for the same agency and do the same job but have entirely different pay and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, Labor will support this bill. We support anything that supports public services and outcomes for employees and customers of Services Australia, but this government has a long way to go to demonstrate that it is serious about supporting the millions of Australians claiming child support, Medicare benefits and government income support, for whom Services Australia is their lifeline. Judging by the record of those opposite, I expect we will see these services continue to erode. It's what the Liberals and Nationals have done for the past seven years, so why should we expect anything to be different now?</span>

The amendments ensure references to Services Australia and the Department of Social Services are correct. To support service delivery, the bill makes governance changes to Services Australia. The CEO of Services Australia will perform the existing statutory roles of the Chief Executive Centrelink, the Chief Executive Medicare and the Child Support Registrar. This change will sharpen the service delivery focus of Services Australia and ensure that the CEO is fully accountable for how administrative decision-making powers are delegated within the agency.</span>

The bill introduces a requirement for a person acting under a delegation, for example, from the Secretary of the Department of Social Services or a subdelegation from the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Chief Executive Medicare to comply with any directions from the delegator. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020. In 2010, the Labor government introduced subdivision JA into the Native Title Act 1993. That subdivision enabled the urgent construction of public housing and a limited class of community facilities, including education, health and emergency services facilities, as well as staff housing associated with these facilities, on land in Indigenous communities that is or may be subject to native title. The process of subdivision JA is available where the facilities are constructed by or on behalf of the Crown, a local government body or other statutory authority. In essence, this subdivision was introduced by Labor when it was last in government to deal with a situation where there was an urgent need for the construction of public housing or other public facilities on land subject to native title. The subdivision provides for a degree of consultation with affected parties, including periods for comment on any proposed construction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When introduced, the provision included a 10-year sunset clause, which was to approximate the duration of the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing, which Labor had put in place. This bill will extend the operations for a further 10 years, and Labor supports that extension. The provision has been used sparingly over the decade that it has been in force and it has been a very useful means of helping to facilitate the building of necessary facilities on land subject to native title. Nevertheless, I am aware of concerns in some First Nations communities about consultations in relation to the construction of housing and other facilities. This includes the need for consultation, not just before construction but also during construction and after construction is completed, to ensure that the facilities are being used and managed in a way that is consistent with community needs and desires. With this in mind, I take this opportunity to encourage the government to ensure this subdivision continues to be used only when strictly necessary to facilitate urgent construction. I also call on the government to ensure that, at all times, proper, good-faith consultations take place with affected communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legal framework contains a number of safeguards for consultation. This includes a requirement that affected parties should be given notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed construction. Furthermore, the subdivision requires consultation to take place at the request of affected parties and ensures that construction cannot commence before the consultation period ends. The Attorney-General has oversight of each of these steps by virtue of reports required from the bodies seeking to undertake construction. Importantly, subdivision JA enables the Attorney-General to prescribe how consultations with native title parties should occur, including putting in place specific requirements. These provisions for consultation are an essential part of Labor's original design for subdivision JA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But legislation alone doesn't ensure that proper consultation occurs. Meaningful consultation requires good faith, commitment and integrity on the part of the parties. It cannot be a box-ticking exercise. Too often we've seen First Nations concerns about the use of their lands disregarded and overridden. Examples of this abound, but one clear and devastating illustration is the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan rock shelters in May this year. What this event exposed is how little genuine understanding there is of the unique spiritual connection that First Nations have with their lands, and how little respect is afforded to that connection in our national laws and practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the failure of governments, when consulting, to consider the diversity of perspectives that may exist among native title holders. In the native title space, consultations that only occur with representative bodies may sideline important voices. Efforts should be made to ensure that native title holders are directly engaged wherever possible. In order to facilitate proper consultations, the provisions of subdivision JA must be given effect by the Attorney-General and this government. The Attorney-General must engage in oversight of the consultation processes as envisaged by the legal regime. He must use his powers to prescribe consultation requirements that suit the needs of communities and give integrity to the processes outlined in the legislation. I urge the Attorney-General and the government to listen to the concerns of First Nations communities and to use these provisions sparingly and in good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to note that when subdivision JA was introduced it was accompanied by a significant financial investment by the then Labor government to address historic underfunding of housing in remote Indigenous communities. This stands in contrast to this government's approach, which has been to walk away from remote housing. This year's budget only included remote-housing-specific funding for the Northern Territory and Queensland, even when the funding provided doesn't fulfil the existing need and ongoing demands. Housing is a critical part of ensuring an adequate standard of living and basic human rights for First Nations peoples, especially those living remotely. The Commonwealth should be actively engaged in ensuring these rights are upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor supports this bill, but we do urge the government to take note of concerns raised and, most importantly, to listen to First Nations in the exercise of the powers conferred by these provisions.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I want to notify the chamber that this is not my first speech. The Greens will not support the Native Title Amendment (Infrastructure and Public Facilities) Bill 2020, for the simple reason that it is against the rights and protections that are given to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in particular the right to free, prior and informed consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be moving amendments to this bill. Instead of extending the operation of section 24JAA by another 10 years, as the government has proposed, we are proposing to extend it by only one more year. In our view, the minister has not made the case for why a 10-year extension is required. The minister has not clearly outlined how or when native title claimants and traditional owners have been so unreasonable that proper negotiation and consultation should be ditched. It's sad that the need for more public homes in our communities is being used as a wedge by this government to undermine the fundamental rights of traditional owners to have full prior and informed consent on everything that happens on country. If the minister were serious about negotiations with traditional owners, he would have funded prescribed body corporates properly and would not have needed to rely on a 10-year extension to section 24JAA. Our amendment would give the government one more year to make its case as to why an extension to that section is needed and then come back to this place and make a case properly and transparently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has got some gall putting this bill up during NAIDOC Week, particularly when the NAIDOC theme is 'Always Was, Always Will Be' Aboriginal land. It's important to tell some truths. Healing starts with truth-telling. The truth is that NAIDOC Week is when we celebrate the history, culture and achievements of our people but also when we celebrate and honour our struggle and the struggles of our ancestors and elders—struggles that began in the very moment this continent was invaded. The truth is that NAIDOC Week has its roots in protest and resistance, especially the Day of Mourning, which was observed by our people in 1938, on the 150th anniversary of Invasion Day. The truth is that the Day of Mourning was commemorating 150 years of the brutal, cruel and savage treatment of our people. It was a protest against the genocide of our people, the theft of our land and the attempts to destroy our cultures and our languages. The truth is that these are not things that belong in the past; these are things that are happening right now. It's not lost on me that this place was not built for me or for my people. The government won't even fly our flag in this place!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here, in this place, as a proud traditional owner and a native title holder. I know what it's like to navigate my way through the native title obstacle course, which is what it is. Minister Wyatt's view is that when Indigenous Land Use Agreements are not possible, section 24JAA would kick in to build infrastructure on country against the wishes of traditional owners on the assumption that the government knows best about what our communities need. The minister also assumes that the government can be trusted to be fair and reasonable and consult widely with our people; not just with registered native title claimants, but with everyone, including all Aboriginal people on country. We know this is not the case. They can't even be trusted to fly our flag.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the bill, there is no legal requirement that agreement, via an Indigenous Land Use Agreement, be achieved first. The government hasn't provided any information about why it can't just rely on an ILUA. The government hasn't provided any proper justification as to why it can't just continue to rely on ILUAs. Let's tell the truth. What this bill really does is completely bulldoze through the wishes of traditional owners by allowing the government to completely bypass them about what gets built on their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government bill also doesn't require consultation that has free, prior and informed consent as an endgame. It's not clear if native title holders could substantially influence the outcome of decisions of what happens on country. Any consultation process that doesn't have full prior and informed consent as its end goal is not consultative at all. If traditional owners or native title holders can't or don't agree with the government about what gets built on their country, then that's usually for a good reason. This bill gives the government the upper hand in negotiation, because, if negotiation breaks down, the government will get to do whatever it wants anyway. That's not right. This is why we are not supporting this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill is not in line with the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People that everything that happens on country needs free, prior and informed consent. Look it up, people! Why does the government need an act of parliament to negotiate with traditional owners? What is so hard about sitting down and talking to people? As traditional owners, we demand our rights as sovereign people—that's right, we are sovereign people; we haven't ceded our sovereignty in this country—just another reminder of that, too—and we demand to have a say on all our affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Wyatt has said that extending section 24JAA for another 10 years would or could be used to build more public homes. Has the government only now just realised that we need more public homes? This government has been in power for seven years. It's just now realising that it needs to build more public homes in rural and remote communities, and of course it will continue to disrespect Indigenous people because the question of sovereignty cannot be addressed in this country. Who are the real sovereigns of this country, I ask? This is how much governments don't listen. We've been telling them for years. If the government wanted to do something about building more public homes, it would have done something about it already. It would not have waited until the section was about to expire to suddenly realise it needed to act. It's sad that the dire need for more public homes is being used as a wedge. I remind senators that this bill is not only about more public homes, but also other types of infrastructure that community may not want.</span>

Let me start by saying that it is expected that the JobMaker hiring credit will support around 450,000 jobs for young people to move them back into employment, at a cost of $4 billion. We know that employers will be able to claim the JobMaker hiring credit for new jobs created over the 12-month period beginning 7 October for up to 12 months for each job. The credit itself is only available for additional jobs. Employers can't reduce their current workforce, by either dismissing employees or reducing their hours, to re-engage new workers performing the same work to receive the hiring credit. All employees have protections under existing industrial relations laws from unfair or unlawful dismissal, including non-genuine redundancies.</span>

They engage with the full repertoire of information that's available to them. They engage with government. I'm sure they engage with those opposite, although one would not be sure how productive that would be. Nevertheless, those processes are undertaken and senators make their own decisions. I don't impugn the integrity of senators who make their decisions based on the information before them. I'm not going to impugn Senator Hanson. I'm not going to impugn Senator Roberts. If those opposite and Senator Ciccone wish to do so, that is a matter for them. </span>

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on Australia, as it has on countries right across the world. Our economy, as we know, contracted by seven per cent in the June quarter, but this was substantially less—a much better performance than many of our international peers. In the UK it contracted by 20 per cent, in Canada by more than 11 per cent and in the United States by more than nine per cent. It was the decisive action that our government was able to take, thanks to years of good economic management, that enabled us to respond so strongly. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we're now seeing our economy recover well as well. Our economic recovery plan is working. It's a long journey to come back from a hit this big, but 450,000 jobs have been recreated in the last four months. More than half of the record number of jobs lost from the COVID-19 crisis have already been recovered. Yesterday, we saw that the consumer sentiment index has risen again, for the third straight month. In fact, consumer sentiment last month had its single biggest rise in a budget month since the series was created in 1974. We also saw the consumer confidence index up for the 10th consecutive week, and it's now hit an eight-month high. Business confidence is up as well. It's up for trade, up for transport, up for construction and up for mining. </span>

Our budget outlined incentives to help businesses be encouraged to invest more, to ensure that they could carry back losses, to recognise those under financial pressure this year, and to ensure they can invest and deduct to incentivise the bringing forward of economic activity. And, yes, the hiring credit helps and encourages them to employ more young Australians. </span>

We know, when we look at the old Newstart data as well, that when young Australians get stuck on unemployment for too long it is much harder to get them off those unemployment benefits. That's why the JobMaker hiring credit is being put in place: to provide that incentive to make sure we don't have undue numbers of young Australians stuck on the unemployment queues any longer than necessary. </span>

A more fulsome answer is this. I completely reject the allegations that this employee, Ms Rachelle Miller, has made against me and my former chief of staff that were reported by two media outlets today. During the time of her employment, between late 2017 and mid 2018, Ms Miller was provided with support, leave and flexible work arrangements to accommodate her own personal circumstances. In fact, in the ABC article today Ms Miller herself is quoted as saying: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Due to the persistent rumours across the building, during my first week in the office I confidentially let Minister Cash know that I had a relationship with Alan that was now over, and that my loyalty was with her.</span>

We know from US President-elect Biden's report of this morning's phone call between the President-elect and the Prime Minister that the discussion included confronting climate change. Interestingly, the report of the equivalent conversation with the Japanese Prime Minister noted their shared commitment to tackle climate change. We also know that the Prime Minister tried to cut the climate crisis out of reports of his conversation with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. So I'd like to get some things on the table now. How did climate feature in the conversation the Prime Minister had with President-elect Biden, and did they discuss how Australia's 2030 targets lagged the rest of the world, contrasting starkly with President-elect Biden's commitment to zero carbon from electricity by 2035?</span>

I've seen the read out of the President-elect's call with Prime Minister Morrison. I think it is important to reinforce—and I noticed Senator Rice did not refer to this—both leaders, President-elect Biden and the Prime Minister, made clear our strong commitment to strengthening our alliance even further as we head towards the 70th anniversary of ANZUS next year. We agreed there was no more critical a time for our alliance as we face the global pandemic and we face a much more uncertain strategic environment.</span>

                  </a>  I think I had just said that the leaders discussed their shared values, our many shared interests, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. They also discussed the need for like-minded liberal democracies to do more together, which I'm sure would be endorsed by Senator Rice and those in her party, whether it is in the G7-plus, the Quad or the G20 through the leadership of multilateral institutions. Prime Minister Morrison has also indicated that their discussion included addressing global environmental challenges, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and plastics pollution in the oceans. The Prime Minister welcomed President-elect Biden's commitment that the United States would rejoin the Paris Agreement, which, as I would note, Australia has been a continuing and committed member of. They also discussed the alignment between the President-elect's climate change platform and Australia's focus on practical measures to reduce emissions through investment in clean technology and on exploring opportunities for partnerships on clean technology, investment and deployment.</span>

Furthermore, European countries have already committed to increasing their ambition to 55 per cent below 1990 pollution levels by 2030. Will the government commit to stronger, more ambitious 2030 targets ahead of COP 26?</span>

The Australian government intends to communicate our long-term emissions reduction strategy before COP 26. The Paris Agreement encourages parties to strive, to formulate and to communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. It does not, as it stands, require us to submit a long-term emissions reduction target. This government has released the Technology Investment Roadmap's first annual Low Emissions Technology Statement, setting out stretch goals for key technologies to underpin the transmission to a low-emissions economy. These goals will be reviewed annually and with the flexibility of adding new technologies as appropriate. Australia's Paris target to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 is a responsible and ambitious contribution to global climate action. It is ambitious because it represents a halving of emissions per person in Australia and a two-thirds reduction in emissions per unit of GDP. Those reductions are amongst the highest of G20 countries.</span>

The minister will be aware that <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span>, a floating production storage and offloading vessel, is sitting off the coast of Darwin in lighthouse mode after the government forced the operator into liquidation. NOPSEMA's refusal to direct the company as to what safety issues needed to be addressed to get the vessel back into production, a criticism levelled at the government in the Walker review, is now costing the taxpayer $1 million per week—that is, 34 ICU beds per week. According to evidence provided at estimates, the government has spent more than $60 million thus far. By my estimation, the government is shortly going to run out of the offensive $76 million budgeted to deal with this. Have you got enough money in the budget to deal with this blunder? How much is the total cost to the taxpayer going to be? What is the plan to deal with this government induced money slick leaking from the vessel?</span>

It is the absolute priority of this government to ensure the safety of any crew on these types of vessels whilst also protecting the marine environment.

We've also ensured that the necessary insurances and memberships are in place. These include memberships of the Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre and Oil Spill Response Limited and insurance through Lloyd's Ship Emergency Response Service. As part of developing a longer term solution, we have been engaging with industry more broadly, understanding that this matter needs to engage everybody whilst making sure of the commercial viability of restarting the program and meeting the requirements of the complete decommissioning or remediation projects associated with making sure that this facility is safe for people and for the environment. I can assure Senator Patrick that the government will apply whatever resources are necessary to ensure the safety of the crew and to protect the marine environment.</span>

Firstly, nothing in the operation of the commercial world is without risk, but of course the government does whatever it can to mitigate against and minimise that risk. That is why the role of NOPSEMA is so important. It's because of their independence around safety and the environment and the oversight that they undertake. Certainly the role you just suggested that NOPSEMA should have been undertaking is not their role. They are the safety and environmental oversight body.</span>

Beijing has this week disqualified four duly elected Legislative Council of Hong Kong lawmakers. On 11 November, the 23rd meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing agreed to a resolution that outlines disqualification criteria for members of the legislative council, including a specific reference to 'endangering national security'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the view of the Australian government that the disqualification of candidates and members severely undermines Hong Kong's democratic processes and institutions, as well as the high degree of autonomy set out in the basic law in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Australia has issued a statement. Australia calls on authorities to allow the legislative council to fulfil its role as the primary forum for popular political expression in Hong Kong and to remain a key pillar of the rule of law and the 'one country, two systems' framework. We urge the Chinese government and Hong Kong authorities to uphold their longstanding commitments and international legal obligations. This is critical to maintaining international confidence in Hong Kong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest measure follows earlier developments that have also concerned Australia and many other nations. It continues an approach that steadily erodes the rights of the people of Hong Kong. Australia and the international community will maintain a consistent focus on human rights and principles of freedom, transparency, autonomy and the rule of law and will continue to monitor developments in this matter closely.</span>

In Senate estimates this week, it was revealed that the ABC managing director received half-a-dozen emails as well as phone calls from staff of government ministers questioning the airing of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program 'Inside the Canberra bubble'. It was also revealed that other ABC staff and the ABC Board were contacted by government representatives about the program. Who contacted the ABC Board and management? When did the Prime Minister or his office first become aware that ministerial staff had contacted the ABC Board and management about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program?</span>

I didn't call you up on that, but I think that came perilously close to imputing a motive to the actions of another senator in performing their duties as a senator.

The Morrison government is absolutely focused on supporting all Australians as we fight our way through this incredible pandemic and as we reopen the economy. Over the course of this year the government has provided leadership and support to the community. We have tried to cushion the blow from the pandemic with enormous fiscal and economic support through programs such as the JobKeeper program and the JobMaker program in the budget, and through enhanced measures across the income support system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the Prime Minister and I announced that we will extend temporarily this enhanced support through the social security system for a further three months, as economic confidence builds and as momentum builds across the economy. We're spending $3.2 billion in the first three months of next year to extend the supplement from 1 January to 31 March. Importantly, our extended temporary measures go much, much further than just the supplement. For an additional three months, we'll be expanding the eligibility for these payments. These measures will enable about 185,000 people who otherwise would not be eligible for payment to access payments during these uncertain and challenging times. That includes such things as the extension of the partner income taper test so that people will be able to access some payments where their partner earns less than $80,000 a year. We'll also be extending eligibility to people like sole traders, people who are self-employed, people who have been stood down, people who have to isolate and people who are looking after somebody who has had to isolate as a result of the COVID pandemic. We'll also extend the nil rate period, which basically means that people will be able to retain their concession cards as they return to the workforce, to provide additional confidence, security and certainty to them as they make that very, very important transition back to work.</span>

That's why, in September, we temporarily increased the income-free area of the JobSeeker payment and youth allowance other payment to allow people to earn up to $300 per fortnight. That means that recipients can earn that $300 a fortnight without losing a cent of their payment.</span>

We know, through our priority investment approach, that people who report earnings, even if they're only a small amount of earnings, are twice as likely to come off payments than those people who do not report earnings. This is absolutely essential as we help people to re-engage with the workforce as our economy reopens and people can go back to work.</span>

Just last week the Reserve Bank confirmed that the economic recovery in Australia is well underway. They upgraded their forecast around Australian economic growth and our labour market. Pleasingly, 450,000 jobs have been created in the last four months, with more than half of the record number of jobs lost having already now been recovered. The RBA expects that further easing in the domestic activity around restrictions, particularly in Victoria, is going to see a boost to employment over the coming months. The ANZ Australian Job Advertisements rose 9.4 per cent in October following an 8.3 per cent increase in September. We've now regained more than three-quarters of the fall that we saw between March and April. The ABS data is also showing significant growth and improvement in job vacancies being reported. Consumer confidence is up—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  Can I make a ruling? I appreciate the point you are trying to make. In my view, I cannot put words into a minister's mouth, nor instruct them on the terms of how to answer a question. If the minister is talking about the very supplement and the very amount and challenging an assumption in the question, I view that as directly relevant. It is very narrow and so the answer must deal with this particular payment supplement, in my view, to be directly relevant. Senator Wong?</span>

                  </a>  On the point of order, Mr President, may I ask you to reconsider the ruling you just made, because in my submission that really does undermine the basis of that standing order and previous rulings. There is a very direct question which goes to whether or not $550 less $250 represents a $300 reduction per fortnight. Just because there's a reference in the minister's answer to the payment—the name of the payment—does not make it directly relevant to the question. My submission goes to actually ensuring that this question time operates as a forum for ministerial accountability, rather than as an opportunity for people to pretend black is white.</span>

                  </a>  On the point of order, it is essential for the minister to be able to contest or question the validity, the elements or otherwise, of a question in their response to that question. A question cannot simply be presented in a manner that expects a black or white response. That is why we have a period of time for ministers to respond in question time. Mr President, your approach has been a consistent one: that the narrower the question, the narrower the scope for the response. But, where a question relates to a particular payment, then there has to be an opportunity for a minister to reflect on all of the elements of that payment, not just respond to the narrow proposition that the opposition may want.</span>

There was no preamble for this question. I accept that. I did not say, and I reject any assertion that I said, a minister only had to mention the payment. As long as the minister is talking about the payment, and only the payment, and the supplement that was asked about in that question, and not ranging across other matters—the point, Senator Wong, is that this minister has to directly address the topic raised.

I can take as many submissions as senators want, but I haven't finished making my point yet. I did not say that the minister only had to mention the name of the payment. I said, previously, the minister had to be talking directly about the payment. Now, that was a very specific question. I made the point there is no preamble. I've allowed you to remind the minister of the question, and I have made it clear that I'm going to strictly apply the test of direct relevance so that the minister must talk about that payment or supplement, as the case may be, in your question, but I cannot instruct her as to a manner or fashion of answering it.</span>

                  </a>  Well—the only thing that Senator Polley's question was based on. What I would like to say is that the government put in place the coronavirus supplement, which is a supplement on top of the JobSeeker payment, to support Australians through this crisis. In September, the coronavirus supplement expired, as per the legislation that was voted on by everybody in this chamber. We all voted for it to go to 25 September. On 25 September, it expired. On 25 September, we put in an extension. And, equally, this week we have announced that as of 1 January 2021 we will be continuing to extend that payment in conjunction with the JobSeeker payment for another three months. But, as I explained to you yesterday, it is part of a suite of measures that we have put in place to help Australians. But, if you'd like me to just talk about the coronavirus supplement, it is something that we put in place. We recognise the job market remains shallow, and that's why we have chosen to extend the payment from 1 January, just like we extended the payment on 25 September.</span>

But, Senator Polley, at the risk of actually repeating my answer to the previous question, I categorically will put on the record, for as many times as you ask this question, that the government has on two occasions extended the coronavirus supplement as part of the JobSeeker payment. You cannot possibly come in here and suggest that an additional $3.2 billion—which the extension of the coronavirus supplement between 1 January and 31 March will actually deliver straight into the pockets of Australians in that three-month period—is a cut. Senator Polley, I absolutely cannot understand how you cannot accept the fact that $3.2 billion of expenditure is actually an increase.</span>

We have stood side by side with Australians who have been impacted by the coronavirus, providing them with support to help them through this crisis, not just in my portfolio area but particularly in Minister Cash's portfolio with small business, in the Treasurer's portfolio with the JobKeeper payment and across just about every portfolio area. In Senator Payne's portfolio we've been supporting our neighbours in the Pacific region, helping them. In Senator Reynolds's portfolio we've been making sure that defence personnel have been helping us through the crisis. To come in here and suggest that we have not been helping Australians, standing side by side with Australians and helping them through this pandemic, I have to say is nothing more than abject rubbish. What I would say is we will continue to stand by Australians by providing them with the help, the welfare support, that they need to get through this pandemic. We don't shy away from that, no matter how much you must ask stupid questions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In my home state of Queensland our agriculture industries contribute more than $12 billion to the economy. Without investment in water security, though, we risk the future of agriculture in the regions at a time when we're already navigating the economic impacts of COVID. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Morrison-McCormack government's plan to build dams across Australia is providing leadership on water security issues for rural and regional Australians?</span>

Senator Canavan, as you would know, the Liberal-National government is getting on with the job of building new water infrastructure to meet the needs of regional Australia and to help make our regions stronger. As Senator Canavan said to me earlier, whilst we are grateful for the recent rains, we need to ensure the security, supply and quality of our water. That is absolutely central to the future of regional Australia, but it is also central to the economic growth of all Australia.</span>

Senator Canavan, you will be pleased to know that the Charleston dam in Far North Queensland—I know you've been to Far North Queensland on a regular basis—will now be finished in the coming weeks. Unlike those on the other side, Senator Canavan does actually know where Far North Queensland is.

I'm disappointed to have to inform you that the Queensland government has not yet brought forward projects, including the Urannah Dam project, for consideration. Just in case you didn't hear me, the Queensland government has not yet brought forward projects, including the Urannah Dam project, for consideration. Senator Canavan, maybe they don't appreciate, like you do, the value of the Urannah Dam to Queensland. It is a huge business case; it suggests a water storage capacity of up to 1.1 million megalitres and 675 operational jobs.</span>

Once again I would reiterate that a decision taken by government—and this is giving you a bit of a lecture about how budgets work—to increase the amount of funding that is available to the economy must only be considered as an increase. For instance, in the budget, there was $507 billion worth of measures included to support Australia as we come out of the COVID pandemic. Two days ago, the Prime Minister and I announced another $3.2 billion. That means that there is $510.2 billion, which is $3.2 billion more. So you cannot possibly say that it is not an increase in spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is the really positive news, and the reason why we have been in a position to be able to work with Australians to put the right balance in place between providing elevated levels of support—recognising that the economy is still only in the early stages of recovery and that the jobs market remains shallow. That is why we made the decision to extend the supplement to support Australians. Over the last four months, 450,000 jobs have been created. Of the 1.3 million jobs that were lost in the early stages of the pandemic, 750,000 have come back. We are seeing the economic recovery start and we are seeing positive moves in the jobs market, but we also understand that Australians do need continued elevated levels of support. That's why this week the Prime Minister and I made the announcement to extend the coronavirus supplement for a further three months, along with all those other changes and enhancements that we will leave in place for those three months.</span>

I have told this chamber on so many occasions in the last two days that we have made an additional $3.2 billion available to Australians in the first three months of the next year. I don't know how you can actually couch that in any other terms but additional funding. You can't say that you've cut something that was never there in the first place, Senator. What we have done is made the announcement that we are going to extend the supplement—that is, $3.2 billion over three months.</span>

We are starting to see jobs come back. Our jobs figures are showing that more jobs are being advertised, more jobs are being created and more people are able to go back to work. In fact, in the May figures we saw that we had 1.6 million people on payments, and at the end of October we saw that we had 1.5 million people on payments. That is way too many people on payments, and we don't shy from that. That is why we've extended the supplement to help those people through what is a tough time. We most particularly want to help them in their pathway back to employment, and that is why the supplement remains in place. But we do need to balance the difference between making sure that there are elevated levels of support to help those people and, at the same time, putting the incentives in place because it's our job to help people back to work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in question time, Senator Payne was asked to confirm that casual workers with less than 12 months continuity are not covered by the unfair dismissal protections under the Fair Work Act. Senator Payne was also asked to confirm whether or not One Nation senators in this place were advised that casuals with less than 12 months employment are not covered by unfair dismissal protections. The minister was asked to explain to the Senate, and through it to the Australian people, why the government are leaving casual workers exposed and vulnerable to unfair dismissal in favour of workers who are eligible for the hiring credit. Unfortunately, what we got from the minister today was an absolute zero answer to our question. That's not a surprise. After all, it is very clear that this government is all about announcements and no substance when it provides answers to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's review a few facts about casual workers in Australia. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there were just over 2.6 million casual workers before the pandemic hit. At 24 per cent, that's just under a quarter of all workers nationally, up from 19 per cent in the late 1990s. The work is in retail, trade, accommodation and food services, construction, health, education and transport—industries that are absolutely crucial to ensuring that our economy rebuilds post pandemic. Again from the ABS data, of those 2.6 million workers, one million had been with their employer for less than 12 months. Casual workers are more likely to be young and they are more likely to be women. I know this being a former union official with the SDA union, having represented these many millions of workers in retail, hospitality and warehouse jobs. Senator Farrell would know this, too, being a former official and national president.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hiring credit leaves around a million casual workers unprotected from unfair dismissal and vulnerable to having their hours reduced or being let go. This concern has been raised by Labor, the union movement and a range of other stakeholder groups. The question is: why? Why is it that in a relatively simple amendment the government will not help protect a million of Australia's most vulnerable workers, who are predominantly young and women? These workers were excluded from the JobKeeper program and now they are being excluded from the basic entitlements that other workers in this country get to enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Casual workers deserve better. They deserve the respect of this government. They deserve the respect of every senator in this place. This government has exposed one million workers to the risking of being sacked without recourse in the middle of Australia's deepest recession, at a time when there are more than 100 people applying for every one job. This government, if it were fair dinkum, would be truly respecting our workers and supporting them. If this government truly respected workers as it claims, it would include them in the basic unfair dismissal protections. After all, the government claims that it's working side by side with workers. Let's do it. Let's protect these workers. Let's protect all workers in this country and make that contribution back to the Australian economy. After all, we all want to see our economy rebuild and rebound after what has been a pretty unbelievable 12 months. Yet, instead, casual workers will again be left behind by this coalition government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:08</span>):  I know it's been a tough week for the opposition; they have lost perhaps the only voice of common sense from their frontbench. It's now a no-Joel Labor Party—a Joel-free zone over there on the other side. That means it's a job-free zone in the Labor Party as well. It's a job-free zone over there in the Labor Party. That was the only member of the Labor Party frontbench who was actually sticking up for people's jobs, sticking up for the dignity of work and sticking up for a future Australia that could create jobs in industries like mining, agriculture and stuff that is the bedrock of our nation. He's gone. He's gone because he couldn't cop sticking around with a bunch of crazy lefties who hate those industries and want to see those jobs go. So he is out of the tent. Is it just a coincidence, then, that the week that Joel has left the coop is the same week that the Labor Party spend their question time questions on being against a program called JobMaker?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've spent their whole week being against a program that is about making jobs, the very week that the only bloke who wanted to make jobs left their frontbench. I don't think it's a coincidence. I don't think it's a coincidence at all. I think there's causation here, not just correlation. There's causation here that the one bloke in the Labor Party who was up for defending jobs has gone and now the Labor Party are spending their tactical time opposing a program that is all about creating jobs for Australians. This program, the JobMaker program, is all about providing incentives for people to create new jobs, for businesses to put people on, and what do the Labor Party do? They oppose it. They want to oppose providing incentives for employers to create jobs because they're just not in favour of jobs. It's not their focus as a party—certainly not one without Joel Fitzgibbon there at the front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think sometimes the Labor Party do like to talk about jobs. They do sometimes come out and say: 'We want to support jobs. We want to support a hydrogen industry.' Sometimes they come out with things like, 'We're going to support hydrogen. There are going to be jobs in hydrogen.' Well, those jobs are fake jobs. There is no large-scale hydrogen industry across the world and not likely to be one for decades. But Labor get behind these industries and try to con workers in the mining sector and workers in power stations by saying, 'We'll be sacking you, but, don't worry, there'll be these other jobs'—these fake jobs in industries like the imaginary massive hydrogen export industry that we'll never get to in any reasonable time frame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Labor Party are against the JobMaker program but all for a 'JobFaker' program. That's their policy. The policy of those over there is for a 'JobFaker' program, because they're all about supporting fake industries, fake jobs, to try to con hardworking Australians out of their livelihoods. We won't do that here; we won't cop that here. We'll be defending and fighting for those jobs through programs like the JobMaker initiative. We'll be making sure that we fight for the right of Australians to work—to have a job and have a livelihood. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the specific issue that Senator Ciccone raised, the fact that the unfair dismissal laws do not have the same protections for those who are casual for less than 12 months—we haven't changed the unfair dismissal laws while we've been in government. They're the same provisions as were there when those opposite were in government. The last major change to industrial relations legislation was under the Labor government. They set up those laws. They are what they are right now because they were ticked off by the Labor Party. You cannot be just wantonly dismissed from your job, but, yes, there are extra protections under the unfair dismissal laws for those who are in more permanent work. Those are the laws that were put there by the Labor Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  Today we asked the government about its absolutely grubby deal with One Nation to strip workers of protections against being sacked and replaced by businesses that are using the government's JobMaker hiring credit scheme, and there are a million workers out there who got no answers from this government in question time today. They got no answers as to why the government has teamed up with One Nation to allow these workers to be replaced, in the middle of the worst recession in 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In blocking our sensible amendments to this bill, the government and Pauline Hanson's One Nation have hung out to dry over a million people who need support today—older workers who can now be replaced by younger workers on the government's JobMaker hiring credit scheme. What Senators Hanson and Roberts have done in this dirty deal with the government is hang out over a million workers in the middle of a global pandemic and the worst recession in 100 years. They've absolutely hung those workers out by refusing to support our amendments and giving them no answers today about exactly why they've chosen to ignore and vote down amendments that would have protected older workers from being unfairly dismissed. That's all they would have done—protect older workers from being unfairly dismissed in favour of younger workers who attract the government's hiring subsidy. They've absolutely hung out older workers who have no access to unfair dismissal protections today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains unclear as to whether Senators Hanson and Roberts understood what they were voting for or whether they understood that these workers have no access to unfair dismissal protections today. Casuals with less than 12 months service have no access to unfair dismissal protections today. Permanent workers, casual workers and part-time workers with less than 12 months service in a small business have no protection from unfair dismissal today. These are the workers who could be thrown on the scrapheap, who could be replaced if they are over 35, by the government's and One Nation's failure to support our amendments and protect these workers from being replaced or unfairly dismissed. These workers have been hung out. They've been hung out by the government. They've been hung out by Pauline Hanson's One Nation. They've been hung out in the middle of this recession. They've been hung out right at a time when the latest ABS figures show that 30,000 jobs were reported lost in the last fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a deep jobs crisis in this country, across every state and territory. There have been 470,000 jobs lost since the pandemic began, with 160,000 people projected to lose their jobs by Christmas. This is not the time for the government to leave people behind. This is not the time for the government to leave workers over 35 behind. This is not the time for the government to leave behind older workers who could be replaced by younger workers on insecure jobs because of its dirty dealings with Pauline Hanson's One Nation in the Senate. But we shouldn't be surprised this has happened, because this is a government that finds it all too easy to leave people behind in this pandemic and this recession. One second it's, 'We're all in this together', the next it's 'If you're good at your job, you'll get a job', and it's your fault if you're unemployed in the worst recession and the worst jobs crisis for almost 100 years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of this crisis Scott Morrison told us that support programs would be equal and that they wouldn't leave the vulnerable behind. Well, that was one day, and this week we have seen something different, where the government has teamed up with One Nation on this JobMaker hiring credit to leave older workers behind and to fail to protect them from being unfairly sacked and replaced by younger workers in insecure jobs who may attract this hiring credit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I'm not quite sure if the Labor Party has actually read the details of the JobMaker hiring credit scheme, because there are protections in place. It's very simple: it's not available to an employer if they don't increase the headcount number. If you've got 20 people and you sack somebody and re-employ someone else, you've still only got 20 people. You're not going to go and sack someone and then re-employ them, because you won't get the hiring credit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last 24 hours, Labor has been running around making personal smears against One Nation for voting with us. Pauline has got the intelligence to actually sit down and read the legislation. It wouldn't do Labor any harm to sit down and actually read the legislation for a change, instead of making personal smears and innuendos across all their social media platforms. Maybe if they spent a little more time reading, understanding and applying the law, and less time on indoctrination and intimidation and smearing and making videos on social media, they would understand the legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been points made in here today about how casuals aren't entitled to the same rights and privileges as other types of employees. That's because a lot of people choose that type of work—so that they can have flexibility. Let's look at it through the eyes of small business. A lot of small businesses' work and income is volatile. It goes up; it goes down. They need the flexibility to be able to call in staff when they need them and not call in staff when they don't need them. It's this type of rigidity that the Labor Party try and implement in their IR legislation—and it's in the fair work legislation—that gives no flexibility in the workplace to employers. Ask yourselves why employers keep going offshore. It's because of these archaic fair work laws. Ever since the Fair Work Act came in in 2009, the number of people on casual labour has increased because employers won't take on permanent or part-time staff because they know how difficult it is to navigate the fair work system implemented by the Rudd-Gillard government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure, JobMaker, is a $4 billion measure to help people get back to work. It's worth pointing out that, if it wasn't for Daniel Andrews and his catastrophic management of contract tracing and testing, we'd probably have had a lot of these people back to work by June or July, instead of only coming out of it now. We went into COVID in late March and we had got on top of it by late May. We could have contained this to two months. But, no, it's gone on now for over seven months. We've had 10 times the number of deaths than we would have had if we'd fixed this problem in June and the Victorian Premier had actually managed hotel quarantine and contact tracing—but, no, because, when Labor's in charge, you know it's going to be a mess. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So for the Labor Party to come in here and criticise this government, which has been one of the world leaders in reducing case numbers and getting on top of COVID, and in providing income support—I think we've spent about 10 per cent of our GDP in helping people get through this crisis. And what do Labor do? They start playing word games and semantics with numbers, and make out that somehow we're reducing JobSeeker. JobSeeker is still $150 higher than it was this time last year. In case you didn't realise, we've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on keeping people going. That is unsustainable in the long term. It is 'wealth for toil'. We have got to get people back to work. We can't continue to pay people to stay at home. There are employers out there in regional communities who are crying out for labour. And what do the Labor Party want to do? They want to keep these payments going so that we can't get the economy moving again— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  What we've seen from this government—and what we saw from that contribution as well—is a pattern of misleading on this JobMaker policy. We heard it in question time in the response by Minister Payne. The claims that they have been making about this policy have been misleading. This was exposed during Senate estimates. They still continue to claim that this program is going to create 450,000 jobs, when we know through Senate estimates that it is going to provide only 45,000 jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is further evidence that, with this government, there is the claim and there is the reality. They do it with almost every policy, and the Prime Minister is the worst offender. He is the leader and they all follow suit. They make a big claim about what a policy is going to deliver, but the reality is completely different, and it's often Australians who are struggling, like bushfire impacted communities, who are the ones that are actually left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been responsible this year; we have been productive because we know that this is a difficult year for Australians dealing with the pandemic. So we have been constructive, where possible. But we've also highlighted issues that need fixing in a constructive way. We were always concerned, from the day this policy was announced, that it has many flaws, and we've highlighted those. There were the false numbers; the false claims; the fact that over one million Australians over 35 will not be eligible for this program; the fact that this credit can go to firms paying big executive bonuses; and many loopholes, some that the unions have identified, which will lead to more insecure work at a time when Australians can least afford it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the approach that Labor have taken this year is that we have been responsible and constructive. We have been like that for all the significant policies that the government has put forward. We've put forward amendments to fix these loopholes in a responsible way. To their credit, One Nation supported one of these amendments, the one aimed at protections against being sacked or having hours reduced under the JobMaker hiring credit scheme. That was the substance of the amendment that we put forward and which One Nation voted for on Tuesday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation supported this on the Tuesday, and they actually put out a statement as well which said the scheme hadn't been properly thought through, had too many flaws and left older jobseekers overlooked and disadvantaged. This was on the Tuesday, and we know what happened by Wednesday: One Nation had backflipped and decided to support the government. It's a disappointing effort from One Nation but, again, as a Queenslander who obviously follows these issues and the role that One Nation play in supporting the government closely, I have come to expect it from them. They always try to find a way, at the end of the day, to justify backing in their LNP mates and the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think that this time their reasoning deserves special attention. They said that their backflip was based on government reassurances. Let's get this right: Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts spend the majority of their time going around the country and undermining government. They say: 'You can't believe government. You can't trust government. You can't trust them on the Great Barrier Reef. You can't trust them on science.' Basically, that is their message to Australians: you can't trust government. And yet here they are trying to justify in this chamber that their decision to backflip on this issue was because they accepted government reassurances. It does not wash and it is not good enough that One Nation sought to do the right thing on Tuesday and then backflipped under a bit of government pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the real consequence of this—and this is so often the case with One Nation and the work that they do with government—is that it is Australians who are going to suffer from this, particularly those who are over 35 and struggling to get back into the workplace. I note that there is significant unemployment through many parts of regional Queensland. My most recent trip through Hervey Bay and Bundaberg reminded me of this; there is a significant proportion of that community unemployed, and long-term unemployed as well. The reality is that this government program, with the support of One Nation, is only going to be exploited in those communities. We have high unemployment and people who are desperately looking for work, and the fact of the matter is that this proposal that the government has put forward, supported by One Nation, is actually going to undermine those people who are desperately seeking work in many parts of Queensland. It is shameful of the government and it is shameful of One Nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government just doesn't get it. It just doesn't get the seriousness of the action required to tackle our climate crisis. We have an opportunity now with President-elect Biden and his commitment to tackle climate change—with his assertion and absolutely realistic description of the climate crisis as the No. 1 issue facing humanity. I think it is excellent that our Prime Minister had a conversation with President-elect Biden this morning, and it would have been a wonderful opportunity to actually talk about the opportunities of how we could be increasing our ambition to properly tackle our climate crisis with the urgency required. We know that an incoming Biden government is going to take much more action than Trump has been taking, and we know that, given the level of ambition that President-elect Biden has already put on the table, there is the opportunity for us to take some amazing steps forward in getting the level of reduction in pollution that is necessary if we as humanity are going to have a future on this planet. But unfortunately it doesn't seem that the opportunity was there in our Prime Minister's mind. I'm not actually that surprised, given what we know about what laggards we have been on the world stage when it comes to climate over the last seven years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got more out of President-elect Biden's report of the conversation than I got out of my question to Minister Payne today. We are told in the report from President-elect Biden that the discussion included confronting climate change. Interestingly, as I had already noted, the report of the equivalent conversation with the Japanese Prime Minister noted their shared commitment to tackling climate change. Call me a cynic, but the fact that we didn't get a report of the shared commitment to tackling climate change makes it sound to me as if there wasn't a sense of that shared commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I questioned the minister about the conversation. Come on! What did they talk about? Let's put climate on the table. Let's make it an issue. We know, given that President-elect Biden says it's the No. 1 issue facing humanity, surely it's something worth talking about. But, no, it seems that there was no discussion of the need to increase our ambition when it comes to targets for 2030. In fact, all that Minister Payne was able to tell me was that they were talking about the long-term targets, the long-term ambition, and the use of technology. Of course we're going to be using technology to be tackling climate change, but we need more than that. We need ambition and we need targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that President-elect Biden has already committed that, under his presidency, the US's target will be to get their electricity emissions to zero by 2035. We already know that, even before he comes to office, the US's ambition for 2030 is much higher than the pathetic targets that Australia have, because they've got same target for 2025 as we've got for 2030. We know that we've got a President-elect who is committed to increasing that target. So where does that leave Australia? It's clear from discussions and the reports of that discussion this morning that Australia is left where it has been for the last seven years—that is, being a complete laggard on the world stage and completely not paying attention to the importance of this issue. It leaves us there with Russia and the petrostates as being the ones that are beholden to the fossil fuel companies, not willing to do what is necessary so that we have a safe future. Australia is being totally left behind, and yet there is such an opportunity here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COP 26 conference is coming up in Glasgow next year, where Australia is going to be asked to significantly increase its ambition for 2030. We know that virtually every other country in the world is going to be coming to that conference with a significantly increased ambition so that we can be doing what's necessary to try and keep global heating below two degrees. But where's Australia? There's no willingness to commit—a complete failure of public policy.</span>

It's also an opportunity for people around the world to officially acknowledge the losses experienced by parents and families and to express sympathy to all families who've been through this tragedy. I thank John and Kate De'Laney from Pregnancy and Infant Loss Australia, Nicole Ballinger and everyone who signed these petitions, and look forward to the day when Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is acknowledged in Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Summary report of the 24 June 2020 public hearing on the Australian Institute of Criminology</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s National Deaths in Custody Program</span>. Next year it will be 30 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been at least 441 deaths in custody of First Nations people since the royal commission. That's not the number you'll find in this report. This report is about deaths in custody two years ago. We know there have been at least 441 deaths, because families, grassroots Aboriginal people and organisations have been keeping count. I ask the government to reflect on that, because I know they haven't. If they had, they would have implemented all 339 recommendations of the royal commission. If they took the problem seriously, they would have chosen to include stronger justice targets as part of the Closing the Gap agreement. They could have also raised the age of criminal responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If our people were property developers or miners, we would have got everything we wanted before asking. The solutions from countless inquiries have always been clear on what needs doing, the government has just chosen not to do it. Because of the ongoing impacts of colonisation, land theft, the attempted destruction of our culture, genocide and racism, our people are the most imprisoned people on earth. The first people of this country are the most imprisoned people on earth. This figure is only climbing higher, particularly for our women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Institute of Criminology for this report, but it's not good enough to have a system where we have these delays in gathering reliable information and reporting on it. We need to know how many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dying in prisons as soon as it happens. The institute notes that the rates of Aboriginal deaths in custody have been decreasing, and that the rates of deaths in custody for our people are lower than the mainstream population. To that I say: that might be the case, but that's not the point. We are not calling for our people to die less compared to others, we're calling on them to not die in custody at all. The report quotes an exchange between the chair and the institute, where they discuss that our rates of imprisonment are skyrocketing, but they're happy to report we are less likely to die in custody now. What a pathetically low bar. Tell that to five families who have had their loved ones die in custody since June this year. In the absence of a caring and responsible government to keep a tally in real-time, including fast-tracking investigations and ensuring accountability for perpetrators, our families are having to do all of this themselves. There are no words to express my sympathy and also my respect for these brave, staunch and resilient families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations deaths in custody are an ongoing national tragedy. The only way to fix this for all governments is to work in true partnership with the families and to fully commit to implementing all of the recommendations from the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. We need a report to the parliament every quarter on the status of the implementation of those recommendations—a true independent report, not like the government's own review that says 91 per cent of the recommendations are implemented. That's a lie. The government must adequately fund Aboriginal community controlled services and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services to support and divert our people out of the criminal legal system, and also for them to provide legal representation during coronial inquests as well as culturally safe support for our people left behind after a death in custody. The government needs to commit to fully funding custody notification services because they save lives. This report is insulting to families left behind. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  In serving the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Identification of leading practices in ensuring evidence-based regulation of farm practices that impact water quality outcomes in the Great Barrier Reef</span> report is both a monumental failure and a waste of money. In spite of the hundreds of witnesses and submissions, the report provides no genuine review and instead offers only status quo recommendations. Having attended the hearings and read many submissions, I find it astonishing that the Labor authors chose to ignore the witness accounts and instead concluded that the reef regulations are fine. Apparently it's simply that there wasn't enough communication with farmers and that future communication needs to be better. No, it was much more than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This summary of theirs is a massive insult to all those who spent countless hours writing submissions and travelling to hearings. The committee has missed a landmark opportunity to restore scientific integrity, to protect and uphold a scientific method, to protect our hardworking farmers and to keep food on the table and clothing on our backs. As senators, surely our responsibility is to all of these—to balance environmental protections with the right of the general public to eat and clothe themselves at affordable prices and to exercise property rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee consulted academics whose income relies on the assumption that the reef is in trouble because of farm run-off and climate change. It asked those same academics if the reef is in trouble because of farm run-off and climate change. The absence of impartiality compromises the integrity of the committee's processes and outcomes. It's farcical what the committee did. How could they expect that these invested academics were going to say anything other than what they said? Did they expect them to say: 'No, the reef is in great order. Remove my funding'? Not at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contribution of the few independent scientists who presented clear, factual data to the contrary was minimised in the report. Instead, there was plenty of propaganda dressed up as science. For example, on page 5 it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the greatest threats to the health of the Reef is rising sea temperatures and extreme marine heat waves caused by climate change … Present day temperatures are … 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than … in 1900 …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a surprise that the government's own Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority website has the figure at 0.4 degrees centigrade. But listen to how this is expressed: 'The average of the last 30 years is 0.4 degrees warmer than the average of the last 30 years of the 1800s.' Then they went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016, sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef were the hottest ever recorded for the months of February, March and April.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2016 bleaching event that this caused led to over 100 reefs being bleached and a loss of 30 per cent of the shallow-water coral. I remember those scary times and the scary stories of 2016. Claims that the reef is dead and will never come back reverberated around the world and caused a huge drop in reef tourism. That 30 per cent figure was never correct. It related only to a particular type of coral in a particular area, not the whole reef. The World Wildlife Fund of course did their part in the scaremongering, declaring that 50 per cent of the reef was dead. We in Queensland know that the Labor Party have good form for scaremongering, as we are reminded of their calculated election campaign that left Queensland too scared to vote for genuine economic recovery. Those reefs that were supposedly permanently killed by climate-change-induced bleaching—those that were forever dead—have come back to life. The reef has been repairing itself, as it has done for thousands of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My additional comments to the report go through this information in more detail. What's more, academics admitted no change to water quality, despite extensive farming modifications over the last couple of decades. The obvious conclusion from that is that farming is having no discernible impact. Forcing farmers off their land does nothing to help the environment. The basis for the reef regulations' attack on farmers is the statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee heard extensive support for the scientific evidence-base that has shown land-based anthropogenic pollutants have an adverse impact on the Reef's ecosystem …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also heard from reef experts like Dr Ridd and Dr Starck that in fact no such evidence exists that can be considered scientific, meaning that it cannot be replicated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing I comment that it was very pleasing to work with Senator Rennick during this inquiry. I must say that the dissenting report from the LNP was a much more considered document than the main committee report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

I'm sure that those of you who are connected to your local communities—those of you who represent rural and regional areas—know firsthand the toll that the COVID global pandemic is taking on our travel agent industry. These are mum-and-dad businesses in all of our communities. They used to book our kids' overseas jaunts post university, they booked family holidays and they really supported us all to enjoy both our business and personal lives. And now, thanks to the closure of international borders and the realities of dealing with the global pandemic, they're facing an unprecedented challenge to their business model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 40,000 of these people around Australia, and 40 per cent of that 40,000 are located in rural and regional communities. If we want to talk about jobs for the future, this is the industry we need to be talking about. I know that my colleague in the other place Pat Conaghan, the MP for Cowper, has been raising this issue right throughout government, seeking to find support for the hardworking travel agent industry. There are an estimated $4 billion worth of bookings still to be processed on behalf of consumers, funds to be returned to Australians and no relief in sight on border closures and travel restrictions, so this industry needs government at all levels to stand up and provide tailored support for travel agents. Seventy per cent of international travel in Australia is booked through travel agents. Over the past three years the industry has experienced year-on-year growth but, obviously, due to COVID-19 now it doesn't.</span>

                    </a>  I am, Senator. That's exactly what I'm doing right here today. Travel agents have no product to sell, no revenue and no time frame for the industry to recommence operations, so this is a very unique industry in unprecedented times and it does require targeted support.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I rise to take note of the Airservices Australia annual report. There are several important issues that are canvassed in this annual report, and one is the extremely concerning cultural issues in relation to Airservices Australia. The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport has been considering this issue—in fact, a private briefing on it is about to begin right now—but that's definitely not the end of the story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In talking tonight I want to recognise the important work on this issue that's been done by the unions, in advocating for the workers and for safe workplaces. We've heard so much this week about unsafe workplaces here in parliament. Everyone deserves a safe workplace, no matter where they work. We've heard accounts from the management of Airservices Australia of the steps they're taking, but the crucial thing is the implementation—the environment they create and whether people actually feel safe after these processes have been implemented. It's a central issue for every worker in Airservices Australia, because they deserve a safe workplace and they deserve to be supported in their work. In turn, of course, it matters for every one of us who catches a plane. So much of what Airservices Australia does is behind the scenes, but getting it right is crucial for the safety of planes and passengers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to another matter raised in the annual report, which is the important issue of aircraft noise. For many years I've been hearing the accounts of concerned groups around the country about the impact of noise from aircraft. It's precisely for that reason that I introduced the Air Services Amendment Bill in 2018. As I said when I introduced that bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… community members and groups have raised with me their frustration at the lack of clarity when it comes to which authority (or authorities) is responsible for response and action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The rules that govern flight paths and community consultation are written for businesses and operators, not for the communities that live with aircraft noise every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, based on what we hear from those who are still impacted by the noise of flights around airports, it's still the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We urge government to take practical action. The bill that I introduced is there, it's ready, and it could be debated and implemented by the end of the year if the government wanted to do it. I want to thank the many community groups around the country who have organised and are working to make their voices heard. The work they do is so important. It's only through communities standing up and pressuring their politicians that we're going to see some action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report, the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman notes that over the past 18 months Airservices have improved their community engagement capacity but they are 'facing serious challenges posed by the major airport infrastructure developments planned for the next decade'. The report acknowledges:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Airservices will need to ensure its evolving approach to community engagement allows flight paths and other airspace changes to be designed with a more internally integrated approach that involves community engagement from the beginning, and a more collaborative approach …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a recognition of the problem—that's a good start—but I'm yet to be convinced. The proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating as to whether this more collaborative and consultative approach actually gives communities power to influence the level of noise around their homes, which has such an impact on their quality of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue raised in this report that is of relevance is the scandal of the land purchase at the Leppington Triangle. We now know that the department ignored the impact of noise controls when requesting the valuation. So we think some of the work that's been done on aircraft noise for Western Sydney Airport definitely deserves further scrutiny, and we're going to be seeking further information on where corners may have been cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This annual report captures the preceding year for Airservices Australia and highlights real issues of concern. Culture is an important and ongoing central issue that needs future work, and we want to hear more from Airservices about how they are protecting the rights of people who live near airports and how they are making sure those people's voices are heard and really listened to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by noting that I've written to the Deputy Prime Minister about plane safety and adequate support for aviation firefighters where planes have been grounded in the pandemic. It's another important issue and is reflective of the range of issues that are covered by the operation of aircraft across Australia. This parliament needs to be paying more attention to making sure things are being done appropriately. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, let me tell you, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the farmers of Queensland aren't laughing anymore. They're not laughing anymore because punitive regulations have been imposed on their way of farming. Those regulations are that far in front of the research there is absolutely no way these regulations can be monitored and policed, yet these farmers stand to be liable for up to $200,000 if they get it wrong. That's very scary, because there's a history in Queensland of the state Labor government imposing fines on farmers where the law has been ambiguous. A very good example was a farmer who cleared a firebreak. He rang bureaucrats 35 times and he got different responses every time. He ended up getting fined almost a million dollars because he couldn't get a straight answer from the bureaucrats. I happen to know another farmer in my home town of Chinchilla who, when he bought a property, needed to find out what was classified as white and what was classified as blue. He got a different answer from the department of environment than he got from the department of natural resources. So you can have the best intentions in the world about trying to protect the reef and everything like that, but you have to make sure these regulations are enforceable. If they're not, two of our great industries—cattle and cane—synonymous with the great state of Queensland are in jeopardy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That magnificent song I just spoke the lyrics of is from a band called GANGgajang and was released in the eighties. It wasn't just GANGgajang who used to pay homage to the heritage of Queensland; it was a rite of passage. Who can remember INXS's <span style="font-style:italic;">Burn For You</span> film clip released in 1984 where they caught a bus up the North Queensland coast? They had the towns of Gladstone, Mackay and Townsville with much smaller populations, and their last stop was London. It was their homage to the fact that they did their hard yards touring around regional Australia, back when Aussie pub rock ruled the world. And who, of course, can forget what Jimmy Barnes was standing in front of when he went solo in his first single, <span style="font-style:italic;">Working Class Man</span>? It was a burning cane field, because he knew that there was no more of a working class man than the Queensland cane farmer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry was designed to work out whether or not we could rely on the data to demonstrate cause and effect. Obviously, we all want to protect the reef. I have done almost 100 dives. I've dived on the Great Barrier Reef and in other places around the world. I dived on the reef recently, in 2018, and it looked fine, but I'll admit that it's 2,300 kilometres long and we have no way of knowing the health of the full extent of the reef. That is why my very first question to the inquiry was: do we have a database of coral growth rates across the reef that shows whether the reef is growing or whether it's declining? Likewise, I asked: do we have a database showing how much run-off to the reef there is, and is that segregated year by year?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a centralised and consistent database so that we can demonstrate cause and effect. All knowledge is based on three major schools of thought: rationalism, empiricism and scepticism. It's all very well to say: 'We think the reef is dying. We can see a bit of coral bleaching, so the reef's dying.' What you have to do is measure observations, and you have to do it time and time again in order to prove your hypothesis. Unfortunately, we weren't able to do that in this inquiry, because there is no central database of coral growth rates on the reef, so we can't prove whether or not the water quality is a function of run-off onto the reef. It was alarming that when I asked the Bureau of Meteorology about confidence intervals they told me they had a confidence interval of 60 to 99 per cent. That is scary. I can toss a coin and have a confidence interval of 50 per cent that I'm going to get heads, yet our farmers are expected to walk into a court of law with a confidence interval of 60 per cent of their measurement. It's a bit of a lottery.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today, I am introducing Australia's Foreign Relations (State and Territory Arrangements) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government has many important roles to play. But one of the most important is our exclusive responsibility for setting Australia's foreign policy, negotiating treaties and representing our nation internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is not, however, to undervalue the important contribution that State, Territory and local government entities make to advancing Australia's foreign policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The types of arrangements entered into at these levels of government vary from Strategic Partnership arrangements; Memoranda of Understanding to encourage investment or cultural exchange; through to industry-specific cooperation arrangements, for example on education, energy or agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most of these arrangements are a useful and productive part of Australia's huge breadth of international engagement, and it is important that we continue to encourage these links.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government, however, does not currently have visibility of all the arrangements which State, Territory and local governments, and related entities including public universities, have made with foreign governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Commonwealth Government sets a foreign policy agenda to both protect and promote the national interest, there is no consistent practice or requirement for State, Territory and local government, as well as Australian public universities, to consult with the Commonwealth when entering into arrangements with foreign governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This process, or lack of process, creates two significant challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first is that without Commonwealth engagement, there is a very real and significant risk that arrangements may be entered into that are inconsistent with, and in some cases may even undermine, Australia's broader foreign policy objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second is that without this visibility, the nation is unable to leverage these relationships to further our national objectives in our international engagements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This gap in Commonwealth oversight must be remedied, and this Bill will create a process where we all - federal, State, Territory and local governments - work effectively together to ensure arrangements are consistent with our national approach to foreign relations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to assess arrangements between State, Territory or local governments or an Australian public university and a foreign government, and related entities, and determine whether they:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will capture all written arrangements with all foreign governments. This includes, for example national level foreign governments and their departments or agencies, and sub-national foreign governments such as provinces, states or municipalities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is country agnostic and arrangement agnostic - the intention is not to target one particular type of arrangement or country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We recognise, however, that there will be divergence in the likely impact different types of arrangements have on Australia's foreign policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For this reason, the Bill takes a nuanced approach, with different requirements for 'core' and 'non-core' arrangements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">'Core' arrangements are those between State and Territory governments and foreign national governments, reflecting that they are most likely to affect Australia's foreign policy and foreign relations. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides that the State or Territory entity will require approval from the Minister for Foreign Affairs before commencing negotiations, or entering into, a core arrangement. </span>

These should be entirely under the control of the Commonwealth. The whole scope and spirit of the Constitution require that save for the purposes of their domestic policies within their own domains the States shall be blended and absorbed into one political entity. They may still appear in some respects as a body of allied States, but to the Empire of which they form a part and to the world without it they have become and must remain a nation and a Commonwealth one and indivisible."a2a</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Radiofrequency spectrum is a vital resource which underpins many aspects of Australia's digital economy, such as the operation of fixed and mobile wireless communication networks. It is essential that the legislation governing the management of that spectrum is flexible and effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With markets and technology having changed markedly since the current legislative framework took effect, there is a clear need to update that framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment (Reform and Modernisation) Bill 2020, which I introduce here today, will modernise the management of spectrum and radiocommunications in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A lot has changed since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiocommunications Act 1992 </span>was first introduced. For example, when the Act was introduced in 1992, a typical equipment supply chain was from manufacturer, to retailer, to customer. Today, shopping on the internet means that modern supply chains are more diverse and complex making it more difficult to identify and place requirements on different parties in a supply chain and to hold those parties to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The processes in the Act for allocating and re-allocating spectrum, licensing and renewal can be significantly improved, meaning less red tape. Spectrum not being allocated quickly and easily imposes unnecessary costs on both industry and government. It slows the pace of innovation being driven by emerging technology and the enthusiasm of the sector to make better, more creative and productive use of the spectrum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's 2015 Spectrum Review highlighted the limitations of the current framework and looked to reform the way spectrum is managed. Consultation on an initial draft Bill was undertaken in in 2017. When I became Minister, I considered the outcomes of this consultation process, and I listened to the concerns of stakeholders around the costs of transition to a new Act to regulate spectrum. I concluded that the best way to achieve effective reform was through a series of targeted amendments. Following this, further stakeholder consultation occurred in June and July this year, with stakeholders indicating broad support for the Bill that I am introducing today. The proposed amendments in this Bill are in line with the original recommendations of the Spectrum Review and take into account the feedback received from stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments will clarify the object of the Act and streamline spectrum allocation and reallocation processes. They will remove unnecessary prescription and legislative barriers, add flexibility, and more clearly delineate the roles of the Minister and the regulator in spectrum allocation processes.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">additional information gathering powers for the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will now provide a brief overview of the proposed reforms of the Bill. In Schedule 1 of the Bill, the Object of the Act has been streamlined so that the intention of the Act is clear and the long-term public interest is promoted. In addition, issues such as public safety and defence have been made more prominent to further support the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the Bill introduces two new means for clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the Minister in setting government policy and the regulator in implementing that policy. These are Ministerial policy statements and the annual work program. Ministerial policy statements allow the Minister to provide ACMA with policy guidance or to convey government expectations and strategic priorities for ACMA's spectrum management functions. ACMA will be required to produce an annual work program, with the aim of giving more and better information to users and the market. Importantly, the annual work program will be prepared in consultation with stakeholders and ACMA will be required to report back on its performance in its annual report. This builds on the work that ACMA currently undertakes through the annual development and publication of its Five Year Spectrum Outlook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 of the Bill is focussed on licencing and associated processes. Through this schedule the maximum licence terms for apparatus and spectrum licences is extended to 20 years. To provide greater assurance to licensees, renewal statements will be introduced for spectrum licence and complex apparatus licences. This will make clear the requirements for any further licence. This, in turn, will assist licensees to make long term planning decisions. Where a licence is proposed to be renewed for a period of 10 years or longer, ACMA must be satisfied that the issue of the licence is in the public interest. As part of the schedule, the scope of responsibility for ACMA in the allocation and re-allocation of spectrum is broadened, in line with the intention to devolve more responsibilities to ACMA while enabling the Minister to provide policy guidance. ACMA is granted the power to set allocation limits to promote competition and to make spectrum re-allocation declarations to promote efficient planning and use of spectrum bands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 4 enables ACMA to regulate equipment through statutory rules that prescribe technical standards, record keeping requirements and labelling obligations. These rules will be imposed from the point of supply, so an ordinary user can operate a radiocommunications device with confidence that the device complies with a spectrum authorisation or licence. The Bill will introduce civil penalties for breaches of equipment rules, as well as infringement notices for non-compliant users. The Schedule gives ACMA the power to make interim and permanent equipment bans backed up with significant criminal and civil penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 5 expands the powers of accredited persons and is intended to provide ACMA the flexibility to broaden the scope of the existing accreditation powers. This would allow ACMA to devolve certain kinds of administrative or technical work to qualified individuals. This gives ACMA greater flexibility to align resources with priority outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 6 introduces a more simplified and streamlined set of compliance and enforcement powers. This means ACMA takes enforcement action that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. The amendments also include a new civil penalty provision that provides that a person must not engage in conduct that results in substantial interference, substantial disruption or substantial disturbance to radiocommunications within Australia (or between a place in Australia and a place outside Australia).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 7 provides targeted information gathering powers to enable ACMA to require persons to provide information about unlawful possession of devices or compliance or non-compliance with licence conditions. This is relevant to ACMA's administration of various parts of the Act, which have to do with planning, licensing (including re-issue and renewal), interference management and compliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 8 gives ACMA powers to grant certain activities or persons with exemption from compliance with parts of the Act and, amongst other measures, gives ACMA authority to use computer assisted decision making, particularly in the renewal of licences. These types of improvements will provide greater decision-making certainty to the sector and reduce unnecessary regulatory burden.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 9 of the Bill repeals the datacasting transmitter licence framework. This licencing framework has not been used to date. Schedule 10 repeals ACMA's power to hold a public inquiries about radiocommunications which has also not been used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, this Bill provides a clear reform pathway to modernise our spectrum management framework, which will deliver benefits to spectrum users by cutting red tape. It provides a more flexible framework, and allows a longer-term investment horizon, to allow industry to better adapt to future innovations and changing demand for spectrum, including the rollout of future generation wireless technology.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is a companion Bill to the Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment (Reform and Modernisation) Bill 2020. That Bill extends the maximum licence terms for apparatus licences (including receiver licences) and spectrum licences to 20 years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence of those amendments, this Bill seeks to align some of the arrangements for the payments licensees make for the value of the spectrum that they use under their licences. The arrangements for spectrum licensees include paying a spectrum access charge at a time specified by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. By comparison, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Act 1983</span> provides the licensees of a receiver licence of more than 12 months duration with a choice in when tax is imposed - either a full amount on their licence being issued, or annual instalments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recognising that long-term, high-value receiver licences would become more available under the Government's reforms, the amendments in this Bill will enable ACMA to determine whether the holder of specified classes of receiver licences pay tax upfront or in annual instalments. This will include ACMA being able to specify that all licences for a particular use or of a particular duration need to pay upfront, consistent with general practice for spectrum licences, to avoid causing a distortion in the demand for different licence types.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021</span> seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just over $36.8 billion. These bills ensure there is sufficient appropriation to cover the funding needs of existing programs and for new measures announced in the Budget that fall within existing outcome statements for agencies. This Bill is necessary to support the Government's COVID-19 recovery strategy and to get Australians back to work.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides broadly five-twelfths of the 2020-2021 appropriations, recognising that the Supply Acts passed in March 2020, provided the initial seven-twelfths. For those entities, such as the Department of Health and Services Australia which received their full allocation for 2020-2021 through the Supply Acts, the Bill only provides funding for new measures announced in the Budget. Together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Supply Act (No.1) 2020-2021</span>, this Bill provides appropriations for the ordinary annual services of Government for the full year of 2020-2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also proposes an Advance to the Finance Minister provision of a maximum of $4 billion, as part of a total $10 billion AFM envelope across Bills 1 and 2. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From the date when this advance becomes available, the Government will cease to have access to the previous extraordinary AFM envelope of $40 billion which had covered both odd and even numbered appropriations. By the week prior to the Budget, slightly under $2 billion of the extraordinary AFM has been used. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new total AFM ceiling of $10 billion takes into consideration the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, allocations that have been made to date, the uncertainty around what may be required as part of the Government's future response to the pandemic and its economic consequences and the potential need for the Government to act quickly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, the Defence portfolio will receive approximately $9.4 billion to sustain the Australian Defence Force. The appropriation will be used to support Australian military operations overseas, the delivery of navy, army, air and intelligence capabilities in defence of Australia and its national interests, the provision of support to the Australian community in accordance with Government direction and veteran well-being, mental health and employment outcomes.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio will receive nearly $3.6 billion to support Australia's foreign, trade and investment, development and international security priorities including financial assistance to support vulnerable Australians overseas and to help our immediate neighbours in the Indo-Pacific respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding also supports Australian exporters and tourism operators to maintain and diversify export markets including through a revamped Export Markets Development Grants scheme and air-freight support for high value exports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Education, Skills and Employment portfolio will receive nearly $3.5 billion, including to support the Government's response to COVID-19, for wage subsidies to support apprentices and trainees; the Research Support Program to ensure universities can continue to pursue and deliver world class research; and for the employment services program to support the large influx of new job seekers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the middle of the worst recession and jobs crisis in almost 100 years, and Australians are concerned about their futures. They're uncertain about their futures, and this government is making it worse. They've already slashed JobKeeper. They are winding back JobSeeker again. They're freezing the pension and superannuation. They refuse to deliver a plan for good secure jobs. And, to top it all off, the few schemes they have announced either don't go far enough or the government never properly delivers them. They are letting down Australians at the time when Australians need them the most. They're cutting people's income and support while they are still struggling, and this is hurting families and it's hurting our recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year has been difficult. It's meant loss and sacrifice for too many people. It's critical that we get this recovery right—a recovery which supports those in need of support; a recovery which sees a plan for good secure jobs; a recovery which supports the aspiration of every Australian. But, right now, many Australian families are doing it tough. Many people are struggling to make ends meet on JobKeeper. Many people are struggling to make ends meet on JobSeeker. Many are concerned about losing their job, especially in the period just before Christmas. And of course hundreds of thousands of Australians have already lost their jobs. Many are struggling to get back into work or find extra hours. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister says things like: 'If you have a go, you'll get a go,' or, 'If you're good at your job, you'll get a job.' This is not the reality that so many Australians are actually facing today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest ABS figures saw the number of jobs fall in every state and territory. There were 30,000 jobs lost in the fortnight to 17 October. There have been 470,000 jobs lost since the coronavirus outbreak began, and a further 160,000 jobs are predicted to be lost by Christmas. So this jobs crisis is only getting worse. Contrary to the Prime Minister's statements, there are seven jobseekers for every vacancy today. The reality is that, in this recession, the worst in 100 years, there are just not enough jobs out there right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a lot of cases the difference between being able to make ends meet or not is JobKeeper or JobSeeker, which is why the cuts to these schemes are so concerning. These cuts are causing anxiety, fear and hard decisions for families across Australia. Angela, whose story was reported recently, is on JobSeeker. She said: 'I am really scared. Getting that supplement made a huge difference, otherwise I don't know where I'd be.' Her adult son, who lives with her, lost his job at the beginning of the pandemic. She went on to say: 'If he isn't able to find work by December, we'll have to find somewhere else to live.' But we know just how tough it will be for her son to find work, because he is one of the seven jobseekers for every vacancy that is out there right now. Does the government really think it's fair to leave Angela and her son in this position?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about Ross, from Pakenham in Melbourne, whose story was reported by the ABC just today? Ross is a car mechanic who has owned his own repair shop for 17 years. He said this about the JobKeeper payments his small business is receiving: '<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:ABCSans;&#xD;&#xA;  ">JobKeeper is the only thing keeping food on my table and paying my bills.</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:ABCSans;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:ABCSans;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span>He is deeply worried about the next cut to JobKeeper in January.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What would those opposite say to Angela, Ross and the millions of people in that exact same situation? What would the Prime Minister say to those people? I don't think 'If you have a go, you'll get a go' is going to cut it. People need support while Australia is still recovering, and people need this support to help Australia and our economy recover. But this is a government that finds it all too easy to leave people behind, to leave them out. I remember, and Australians remember, when the Prime Minister stood at a press conference at the beginning of this crisis and said these words: 'We're all in this together.' But while his words say one thing, his actions say something else. These cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker feel very much like he is saying to millions of Australians: 'You're actually on your own now. If you can't find work, it's your fault.' Just this week he said he needs to cut the lifelines people rely on because they're holding Australia back. No; what will hold us back is cutting support too early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether this Prime Minister and this government are cutting people out of support or cutting incomes, they've got form. Just look at the long list of workers who were unfairly left out of JobKeeper right from the very beginning: casuals; freelancers; temporary migrants; NDIS workers; university workers; arts and performance workers; local government employees; many charity workers; international students; and, of course, the early childhood educators, who were ripped off JobKeeper earlier than anyone else in this country. This has a real human impact. It's tearing lives apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year I spoke to Darcy and Giovanni about how being excluded from JobKeeper had impacted them. Giovanni is an international student who was working to support his studies and his family, with a newborn baby. He has spent years in Australia but he wasn't eligible for JobKeeper. The government essentially said to Giovanni, 'Just go home.' This put everything at risk—his work, his studies, his ability to pay his bills, his family. After spending years in Australia paying taxes and contributing to his community, he said being excluded was 'one of the most heartbreaking moments in my life'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Darcy is a veteran hospitality worker. He's worked in hospo for 15 years. He'd never been unemployed until this year. But, due to the casual and transient nature of his work, he too was excluded from JobKeeper. That meant he could no longer pay his bills and pay his rent. He had to move back in with his parents to survive. He described the situation as gut-wrenching when we last spoke. Darcy also noted that he was lucky to have a family that was in a position to support him during this time. But of course many of his colleagues and his friends did not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's approach of excluding millions from support programs and then ripping those support programs away too fast isn't just hurting workers and their families directly; it's hurting Australia's recovery. According to figures from analytics consultancy Taylor Fry, job numbers fell by 1.6 per cent in the two weeks following the reduction in JobKeeper and JobSeeker. That matches up with the ABS data, which showed a five per cent drop in total salaries paid and the loss of 30,000 jobs in that fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the further JobSeeker continues to fall towards the old Newstart rate the more it will negatively impact on people's ability to actually go out and find the jobs that may be there. It's a rate which is so low that it traps people in poverty and actually prevents them from finding employment. This is not an approach that will speed up our economic recovery. We need to be supporting people while they find a way to get back to work, and that means making sure people can afford the essentials they need—training, tools, transport, appropriate clothes and keeping a car on the go. These are not possible on the old Newstart rate, which the government seems to have us inexorably moving towards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cutting support too early hurts the economy and, as Senator Gallagher's motion states, the RBA confirmed this just recently. The Reserve Bank have said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Growth in employment is expected to be subdued over the next few months, as policy support measures, such as JobKeeper, are tapered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So JobKeeper gets cut and jobs growth slows—that's the equation. They also said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a risk that business insolvencies will rise by more than expected as government support programs are tapered, slowing the recovery in activity, reducing investment …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker don't make sense. They don't make sense while people are still struggling to get back on their feet. They hurt families and they slow down the recovery.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government know this. The decision to cut these programs is ideological. They aren't based on evidence or on reason. The government's decision to cut supports too soon and to exclude millions of workers from their programs will mean that this recession is longer and deeper. But the government are going to do it anyway. They are going to exclude almost a million jobseekers over the age of 35 from JobMaker. They are going to exclude one million employers from JobMaker as well. They are going to continue to cut JobKeeper and they are going to continue to cut JobSeeker. They are going to do all of this while they still do not have a plan to deliver and create good, secure jobs for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their budget did not deliver. They gave us a big-spending budget. They are racking up $1 trillion in debt. But contained in that budget was no plan for jobs and no plans for sectors that we know create jobs. There was no plan for early childhood education, no plan for social housing, no plan for cheaper, cleaner energy projects and no plan for aged care. The few schemes they did announce in the budget did not go far enough or, as we found out at Senate estimates, the government inflated the number of jobs they would create.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is going to rack up $1 trillion in debt, but why? What is it doing if it isn't creating jobs? If we really want to look out for workers and their families we need to get this recovery right—a recovery that focuses on rebuilding good and secure jobs, a recovery that works for all Australians, not one that excludes them. We need a plan for this recovery now. We need a plan that means making more of what we need right here in Australia, a plan that gets started on the big transformative infrastructure projects, a plan to guarantee apprenticeships on major federal projects, a plan to address the skills crisis by reinvesting in TAFE, a plan to recharge the workforce participation of women and a plan to power our recovery with clean energy projects and renewables. This is what we need. We need a plan that is committed to rebuilding good, secure jobs in this country—jobs people can count on and jobs people can plan a future on—and that is what a Labor government would do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're eight months into this crisis and action is well past due. People need a government that is on their side, a government that is actively looking out for them, a government that provides the support they need to get through these difficult times, a government that is planning for the recovery—a government that has a vision for Australia's future. But, until now, the government has been more concerned with its ideological battles, attacking workers' rights, slashing support programs, freezing super and pensions, and, as we've seen this week, teeming up with One Nation to reject important protections for workers. It's time for the Prime Minister to reconsider his early cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. It's time for him to commit to a plan for good, secure jobs and to get to work delivering it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I thank Senator Gallagher for bringing forward this motion. It gives us the opportunity on this side to highlight exactly what we have been doing during this pandemic, because it's clear those on the other side don't pay attention to anything that we do. I think that's quite selective on their part, as are the selective quotes that Senator Gallagher has used in her motion; she grabs a few little bits that she somehow thinks are going to support this argument that we're not doing enough for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, nothing is further from the truth. It is absolutely true that the pandemic is a once-in-a-century shock. It is placing immense pressure on health systems and economies not just here in Australia but right around the world. The Australian economy has outperformed most other countries in both health outcomes and economic outcomes right through this crisis. The evolution of the public health crisis shaped the very recovery trajectory for both Australia and the world. The IMF said that it is expecting  that the global economy will contract by 4½ per cent this year. This compares to a fall of 0.1 per cent in 2009 during the GFC. Australia's economy contracted by seven per cent in the June quarter. We know that. But, by comparison, there were falls of around 12 per cent in New Zealand, 14 per cent in France and around 20 per cent in the United Kingdom. Real GDP is expected to fall 3¾ per cent in the calendar year 2020 but grow—I say that again: grow—by 4¼ per cent in calendar year 2021. I'm happy to repeat that if any senators would like me to. It's clear that this outlook compares favourably with a forecast fall of 12.8 per cent in Spain, 10.6 per cent in Italy, 9.8 per cent in France, 9.8 per cent in the United Kingdom, 7.1 per cent in Canada and 6.1 per cent in New Zealand. Clearly, Australia is doing the right things, and they are working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, events in Victoria have been a major setback, because the state represents one quarter of the national economy. Treasury estimates that the imposition of stage 3 and 4 restrictions in Victoria through the September quarter will take two per percentage points off GDP growth. Why is that? Let's look at the mishandling of the pandemic in Victoria. Not only did Premier Andrews let the disease out of hotel quarantine, he brought in some people who I think were called 'security guards', but they provided little security and did little to guard those people in there. Remember, quarantine is a tool used to keep the disease away from the population. That is its only job—to keep the disease away from the greater population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was that major failure by the Andrews government, for reasons their inquiry probably won't even let us Victorians know. And why is that? Because no-one can recall—not the ministers, not the chief of staff, not the bureaucrats that have been thrown under the bus and certainly not the Premier. But he is the one who says, 'Hey, I'm responsible for all this.' When is he going to take responsibility for all that? Why did a lockdown that he said would take six weeks take 14 weeks? There's a simple answer to that. It's because they did not have contact tracing in place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're looking at a public health system and you've got a virus that can spread quickly, what do you need to do? You keep it out of the population. There's a cross against that one; they didn't do that. What do you do next? You have to stop it spreading through the population. What do you use to do that? You use testing and contact tracing, both of which are things that the Victorian government didn't have in place until probably well and truly six or eight weeks into lockdown. Why did it take so long for lockdown to work? They hadn't got their contact tracing working. Why did they end up getting their tracing working? Because our Treasurer, the member for Kooyong, and the Minister for Health, the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt, called on them to do so. There was no movement. The Victorian government was saying to everyone at the daily press conference, 'Our contact tracing is world class.' World-class fax machines? World-class pen and paper? It was an utter, utter failure on any level. The Victorian public health system failed terribly. That brought about an immense cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Walsh, who spoke before me, was saying she gets all these calls. I get a dozen calls a day from constituents, mostly small-business people, as I was before having the honour of being elected to this place. Those small businesses said to me all the way through stage 3: 'I survived stage 3. I got through stage 3.' But stage 4 crushed their business, as it went on and on—their desperation, the cries of anguish over what they were going through. They will acknowledge that JobKeeper kept food on their family's table, but there was nothing from the state government to help them pay their rent or keep the electricity on. There was one tiny little handout six weeks ago or so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Premier Andrews is standing up there every day, saying, 'I'm going to deliver so much largesse in this budget, people will just look at me in wonder.' Well, they're looking at him and wondering why they haven't seen him do anything for the Victorian economy right through this whole mess. He's still standing there. No-one knows when this budget's coming, and small businesses are being absolutely crushed by his failures in public health policy and in not letting them know when help might come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been helping people. We've been helping them with JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and the new JobMaker hiring credit will help enormously. The government's total economic support, since the onset of the coronavirus, totals—let me check this, because I find it really quite staggering—$507 billion. That's 25.6 per cent of GDP in overall economic support. So how can those opposite say that we haven't been doing enough? I find it absolutely amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank governor, Governor Lowe, said only recently—and this flies in the face of Senator Gallagher's motion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the government's strategy is the right one, through the combination of income transfers, incentives to the private sector and direct job creation—that together is going to get people into jobs …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The governor said it would be completely incorrect to draw the conclusion that this is 'a judgement on the government's fiscal strategy'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the government is on the right track …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now refer to some spending by the government in Victoria, which is aimed at trying to help those Victorians crushed by Premier Andrews's poor performance on public health. Around $35.2 billion has been credited to Victorians, with approximately 312,000 Victorian organisations receiving JobKeeper payments totalling about $20.8 billion. And that was as at 4 November, so the amounts will now have gone up. These organisations cover around 1.1 million employees and eligible business participants. The Morrison government has delivered $8.6 billion in cashflow boost credits paid to over 208,000 Victorian entities. Turning to the coronavirus supplement, $3.9 billion has been paid out to Victorians, with 572,000 Victorians currently receiving the supplement. Victorians have received $2.3 billion in the form of the $750 payment under both the JobKeeper and JobSeeker schemes, with 1.8 million Victorians receiving at least one of those payments. These figures show that we have been doing a lot. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher's motion refers to insolvencies. I have received many phone calls from businesses that are fearful of going insolvent, but the Morrison government has done a lot to try to relieve some of their anxieties. The Morrison government will undertake the most significant reforms to Australia's insolvency framework in 30 years as part of its economic recovery plan to keep businesses in business and Australians in jobs. The reforms will help more small businesses to restructure and survive the economic impact of COVID-19. As the economy continues to recover, it will be critical that distressed businesses have the necessary flexibility either to restructure or to wind down their operations in an orderly manner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These new measures, which are similar to the US 'chapter 11' bankruptcy processes, will help small businesses to restructure in a way that means not all their assets are going to insolvency practices. These measures mean that they can keep control of their businesses through this period, because they know best whether they are going to be able to get through it. With the advice and the support of an insolvency practitioner, they can restructure in a way that helps their creditors get what's due to them whilst the businesses keep going. Having been a small-business owner, I know it is incredibly important to have the sort of support from the government that gives you the ability to flexibly and in a controlled way look after your business, get it through the tough times and make sure it comes out the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the allegations of those opposite, the Australian economy is fighting back, with 450,000 jobs created in the last four months, beating all market expectations, and more than half of the number of jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic already recovered. It's good to acknowledge that 60 per cent of these jobs have gone to women, while 40 per cent have gone to young people aged 15 to 24, a cohort that has always struggled with high unemployment during tough times. The Morrison government, through its budget, has done more than anyone else to support those people. Around 60 per cent of the 1.3 million people who lost their jobs or were stood down on zero hours are now back in work. In conclusion, the motion before us is nothing but an opportunity for opposition members to have another whinge, because they know that the Morrison government is doing more to help the Australian economy, more to help Australian workers, more to help Australian businesses, than they ever could.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought forward by Senator Gallagher. I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to highlight to the Senate the comments made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its quarterly <span style="font-style:italic;">Statement on monetary policy</span>, in which it made important statements. These were extraordinary statements to make about the economy, and it's very important that Australians understand the very deep economic recession that we are currently in. The predictions the Reserve Bank is making about how that economy will respond are something that Australians need to listen to and are something that the government needs to listen to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank said that growth in employment is expected to be subdued over the next few months. It also said that improvement in employment has slowed since August. It remains well below its pre-pandemic level, and there is a risk that business insolvencies will rise by more than expected as the government support programs are tapered. This is what the Reserve Bank of Australia is saying—that is, that as the government take supports away, insolvencies will rise. So it seems strange that the government would, this week, announce that they will be reducing JobSeeker payments. Cutting support prematurely to these payments will make the recession deeper and longer, and it's unfortunate that during question time this week the minister has continued to play word games about what this cut, this reduction in support, will mean to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very clever to put an end date on these payments so that every time the cuts came through, the government could stand up and say, 'We're not reducing the payment, we're extending it.' But they are, in fact, cutting the amount of money that people who are unemployed in Australia will be receiving and will be relying on during this incredibly difficult time, and during an economic period of our country's history where we know unemployment remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment crisis is getting worse—it's not getting better—as 1.8 million Australians are set to be unemployed by the end of this year—just in time for Christmas. Labor have consistently called for a permanent increase to the JobSeeker amount, and we are calling for the government to provide support to these Australians to get them through this difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government are cutting the coronavirus supplement by $300 per fortnight from when it was first introduced at the $550 per fortnight rate. And when you ask the government why they are doing this—well, first they deny that they're doing it at all—they say that, actually, they're being so very generous in extending this rate. They're denying that they're cutting it in the first place, but, when your questions finally get through the denials and the word games and the very clever language used by the ministers responsible for these decisions, what you discover is that they do not believe that people need this money. They do not believe that they are responsible for helping these people through this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even Senator Ruston has acknowledged that the job market is shallow, but she still thinks that now is the right time to make these cuts. In the last couple of days, or the last week, I recall that Senator Ruston said unemployed people needed to dip their toe into the employment market. There's one vacancy for every 28 jobseekers right now in regional Australia. I'm not sure what employment market Senator Ruston thinks the 1.8 million unemployed Australians are dipping their toes into. They're not sitting at home not wanting to work. That's a fallacy put forward by this government to justify their cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that strikes me about these cuts is the impact they will have on the local economies, the regional economies that are starting to open up. These economies have suffered and they need assistance. We know that people who receive these JobSeeker coronavirus supplements are not saving the money; they're spending the money in local shops, they're going out and doing a full grocery shop for probably the first time in a very long time, they're going to the local gift shop, they're going to the local newsagent and they're spending money in local communities. A report from analytics consultancy Taylor Fry found that reductions to JobSeeker and JobKeeper in September had an 'instant and dramatic' impact on the finances of Australian households. The report found that JobKeeper and JobSeeker cuts would result in $4 billion less income in the pockets of five million Australians. And now they are cutting JobSeeker again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've questioned the government on this issue many times, and sometimes the retort from the ministers and those opposite is that these are silly questions or that these questions are repetitive. But we still have not received an answer as to what economic modelling the government has done on these reductions in coronavirus supplement payments. How will these cuts impact the Australian economy? What impact will making a cut to this payment have on local, small businesses that are relying on people going out and spending this money in the local economy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have spent a lot of time in this place talking about how they support regional Australians. But the truth is that these cuts are hurting people living in our regions. In Far North Queensland, in the electorates of Leichhardt and Kennedy alone, these cuts have ripped out $11.5 million per fortnight out of the economy, and 35,000 people have been left worse off through these cuts. The Far North Queensland economy is reliant on tourism. Seventy per cent of that tourism is international tourism. There is still a lot of recovering to go, and yet this government is taking support out of that economy right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville, in the electorate of Herbert, the cuts have affected 13,900 people, and they're ripping $5.9 million from the local economy. I've spoken to young people in Townsville, students who go to the university there at JCU. For the first time ever JCU has had to have a food bank. People donate food, and students can come and get food from the food bank just to support themselves. That's the level of economic impact that is happening in our regions, and yet the government, who profess to stand up for regional Australians, are cutting back the support that they are giving them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Dawson, 11,000 people were affected by the cuts that the government made previously—$4.3 million was ripped out of the local economy. In the electorate of Dawson, the Whitsundays has been incredibly impacted by international tourism stopping, and yet the government's ripping money out of these regional economies. This is the worst recession that Australia has faced in almost 100 years, and the government is letting more Australians and communities fall further behind. The Prime Minister's premature cuts could push many Australians back into poverty, risk more jobs and business closures and make economic recovery even harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Nationals also decided to exclude Australians aged over 35 from a new hiring credit scheme. This will mean that the recession for those people who we know are relying on JobSeeker payments right now will be deeper and more necessary. The unemployment queues will be longer than they need to be. We know from what the government announced that they believe that all you have to do is put out a media release and jobs will flow—that, somehow, in a media release, putting out how much money you're supposedly spending or how many jobs you are creating is enough. But the people living in regional Queensland are starting to see through a government that are all about announcements and not about delivery. The people living in regional Queensland are starting to see through a government that are all about announcement and not about delivery. Ultimately, if the government were to take back this support in the face of those comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia about how difficult the economic situation is right now, you would expect the government to have a plan for jobs to come out of this recovery. Day after day—and they're going to do it again in this debate in the Senate—they're going to announce numbers and talk about big figures. They'll talk about the things that they are going to do. But we know that what they promise they do not deliver, and they don't deliver jobs in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last budget, before this economic crisis had even started, this government announced it would upgrade the Captain Cook Highway in Cairns. We're still waiting for those upgrades to start. That was all in a media release. Then there's the government's big agenda around recycling. Of the $100 million in the Australian recycling fund, not one cent has been spent. This was a big election promise, and yet the government can't deliver on it. We know that the government has a $50 million mitigation fund that Labor secured in this Senate to spend on mitigation projects to make places like regional Queensland more resilient when it comes to disaster funding. But here we are, in cyclone season and in desperate need of jobs in regional areas, and not one cent of that mitigation fund has been spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAIF has been a complete failure. The government have failed to spend that money. They've failed to deliver what they said they were going to deliver. They have spent more money on senior executives and boardrooms in regional Queensland than on delivering projects through the NAIF. It's been an absolute flop. Every time they get up here and talk about the NAIF, they should be incredibly embarrassed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the JobMaker scheme, which we've spent a lot of time talking about this week, we know that the Treasurer announced in his budget speech that this scheme would create 450,000 jobs. But when we actually asked Treasury, those figures were much less. So every time that the government talks about the economy rebounding, taking away support because the economy is rebounding and their plan for jobs, know this: every time they put out a press release, they don't deliver on it. Every time they talk about creating jobs in regional Queensland, it is more about saving their own jobs—it is about giving them an opportunity to talk about the things that they are going to do. Regional Queenslanders need the government to get out there and get something done. This is the time to do it. This is the time to deliver the jobs that they have promised for years and years but failed to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without a jobs plan, you cannot justify taking support away from vulnerable people who are trying to put food on the table during our deepest economic recession. That is the fallacy of what this government is trying to sell people in regional Queensland. I can tell you that people are fed up and they are starting to see through the constant parade of media releases and no delivery, cuts and no support for the people who need it during our deepest economic recession in regions that desperately need it. But this government gets up every single week and talks about how it supports people in regional Queensland. It doesn't sing true when you actually get there and talk to people who have been left behind by this government and by ministers who are afraid even to call something a cut when it's a cut.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  Thank goodness the Morrison government won the election and is looking after Australians in this unprecedented time of 2020. I would just like point out to Senator Green and to Senator Walsh, who clearly have missed what's been going on this year, that there is a global pandemic. So when we talk about a softening of the jobs market, an expectation that there will be increasing numbers of business insolvencies, that it is a little bit more challenging to find a job, that there are pressures at the moment around the economy and the workforce—that would be due to the fact that we are in unprecedented times globally. That seems to have missed their attention. There is a total lack of recognition of the economic carnage that has occurred globally thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in Australia followed on from the bushfires. That seems to have passed them by. But, as I said, many Australians are incredibly grateful that it is the Morrison government that is in charge. Because the Morrison government had put the economy in such a strong position prior to this occurring that we were able to act quickly, we were able to act responsibly and we were able to act in a way that ensured Australians were in the best possible position to weather the storm and to make an economic recovery as soon as was possible. This included the implementation very early in the piece of two measures: JobSeeker and JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper ensured that employers and employees were able to stay connected. Even when businesses we unable to operate, employers and employees were able to stay connected. What we're seeing now, as businesses are starting to open up, as the economy is starting to move and as workers are returning to their places of employment, is that businesses no longer qualify. I'm sure what those opposite don't understand—since they are so disconnected from small business, family owned businesses and, in fact, anything in the private sector—is that those businesses see as one of their greatest achievements that they no longer qualify for JobKeeper. They absolutely celebrate the fact that their businesses are operating to a level where they no longer qualify for JobKeeper—that they're able to bring their employees back, that they're able to activate once again and act in a way that their employees are back working and contributing to the economy in such a positive way. We on this side understand that it is businesses that create jobs, not unions and not the government. It is businesses that create jobs. It is innovative Australians that create jobs and that ensure the workplace is contributing to the economy and that Australians are able to get back to work and look after themselves and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobSeeker was also put in place. There was a JobSeeker supplement that was put in place—a temporary measure, which is something else those opposite don't understand. They are sitting on my far right, but, of course, they are ideologically on my far left! They would like to see a living wage. We all understand that that's their position. But we did put in place a temporary supplement to JobSeeker, which has now been extended to March. That is something, again, that those opposite don't understand—that additional $3.2 billion of spending through to March. Again, that is an additional $3.2 billion of spending that somehow or other equates to a cut, over there. Lucky for them they don't have to sit an HSC maths exam any time soon. So that has been extended to 31 March. Also, there is a reduction of mutual obligation for an extended period of time. Again, those people who sit at that end of the chamber would have very much enjoyed seeing that being removed for a period of time. But JobSeeker ensured that those who did lose connection to the workforce were able to see that COVID period through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing the economy improve. We are seeing significant improvements. We are seeing consumer confidence increasing week on week. In fact, we've had 10 weeks of consumer confidence consistently increasing. This week, we've seen a fantastic $4 billion dollar program, JobMaker, pass the Senate. Again, we've done something that those opposite don't seem to understand. We have a 10 per cent youth unemployment rate. The last time we had a recession in Australia, the hardest group to get back to work, those that were affected for the most significant period of time, were the younger workers. They found it more difficult to get back to work. They were more impacted for a longer period of time with getting back into the workforce. So the Morrison government is going to invest $4 billion in the JobMaker scheme, ensuring those under 35 are given an opportunity to reconnect with the workforce as quickly as possible. It was wonderful to see Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts get behind that. They understand the importance of supporting our youth and getting them back into the workplace as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note with some irony that it was a senator from Queensland and a senator from Victoria on the other side who criticised what the Morrison government has done in response to COVID. If it wasn't so ironic, it would be laughable. Victoria is the great drag on the nation when it comes to economic recovery. There has been the failure of quarantine. The hotel quarantine disaster led to an extended lockdown. There was the shutdown of the nation's second-biggest economy. There was Premier Dan Andrews in the 'Republic of Danistan', where the dictatorship took off. Everyone was locked down in their homes. The economic tap was turned off. For years the economy will struggle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the Victorian economy that is going to need the most investment to come back. That is where we are having to spend the tax dollars of so many other hardworking Australians, particularly from my home state of New South Wales, where the economy has continued to flourish thanks to fantastic contact tracing—it was the gold standard—and Gladys Berejiklian. Our taxpayer dollars will go to supporting our fellow Australians in Victoria, who had been locked down, thanks to a failed quarantine system. It was a Victorian senator who dared to come in here and criticise the fabulous measures that New South Wales taxpayers et cetera are contributing to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That senator was followed by a Queenslander from the 'Republic of Palaszczuk'. They complained that jobseekers in Cairns can't find a job. If the tourism market were allowed to open, fabulous Sydneysiders would love to come up and spend their dollars. But they are banned for no other reason—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUGHES:</span>
                  </a>  It's a little bit petty. As we know, the Premier of Queensland is the princess of petty. The texts would have been flying last night after they were handed the wooden spoon in the State of Origin. 'Princess Palaszczuk' wouldn't have been happy with that. She'll probably be extending the ban on Sydneysiders for a little bit longer because her football team didn't get up. Honestly, Regina George in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mean Girls</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>would be so impressed with the pettiness we see coming out of Queensland. I'm sure Premier Palaszczuk has her own little burn book going up there at the moment and on the front cover is the fabulous Premier Berejiklian, who is showing the rest of the country what it looks like to do exceptional contact tracing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has not only continued to deliver JobKeeper, JobSeeker and JobMaker to get everybody back to work but delivered a budget that is absolutely focused on jobs. We are seeing job creation occurring across the board across the country in states that are opening up. It was incredibly satisfying for me to go to the fabulous Hunter region, which is an area I look after, to see the investments we're making across the board in so many innovative areas, such as defence industry. I've worked so closely with the wonderful Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price. We've made over $50 million of announcements in fabulous innovative industries. We've looked at making body armour that's more adaptable for different body shapes and sizes and that's lighter and more agile for our troops. Millions of dollars have been invested in submarine technology. We've looked at the Singleton army base and at how we can work better with our troops there. These investments are critical, but that is nothing when you look at the investment we've made on the energy side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's always a pleasure to see the member for Hunter at these events. No-one understands the importance of affordable and reliable baseload power like the member for Hunter. It's such a pity to see he has been forced out of the shadow cabinet because of the loony Left taking over the energy policy of those opposite. Poor Joel is out on his own. He can't even look his own constituents in the face anymore because, as much as he understands that the blue-collar, high-vis voters are the old Labor voters of the past, his party has now abandoned them for the inner west, for the latte-sipping lefties, for making sure that it's all about where the sun is providing the renewable energy. It doesn't care if Tomago smelter goes offline. When they're offline for three hours, that's it. It's finished. The smelter closes. But that's okay. They don't care about that in Newtown. They don't care about that in Newtown at all. Poor Joel's had a bit of a shocker this week, poor love. He's had to step down. Anyway, I'm sure I'll see him soon when we're up there again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's absolutely critical that we acknowledge the fantastic work the Morrison government is doing on behalf of all Australians. We know how grateful they are because we hear it all the time when we're out talking to those real Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on what was a very, very important motion advanced for discussion today in the chamber by Senator Gallagher. I thank her for bringing this matter to the floor of the Senate. We haven't got many people in the parliament because of the COVID reality. They've only just started coming back this week. But I know a lot of people will be listening to parliament and they will be relying on this parliament to acknowledge the reality of their lives, to tell the truth to them about what's going on and to authentically provide them with the support that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear. We are in a recession for the first time in 30 years and this government has set up a budget that will put Australians in $1 trillion worth of debt. That's $1 trillion of debt set up for Australians by this Liberal and National Party government. We just heard a contribution from a Liberal Sydneysider who actually believes that she has some understanding of regional realities for Australia and that she's got a handle, like the rest of the Liberal Party continue to say, on small business. Well, I can tell you that I know small business in and out. I know it from my own childhood and from my own growth as an adult as well. I'm surrounded by businesspeople in my family. Small business is being overlooked by this government. Small business is not being listened to by this government. Small business will be exploited by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the report, but, before I do that, I just want to make one comment about the design capacity—or the design incapacity—of the government when it comes to genuinely helping somebody get a job and genuinely helping a small business. They are missing the mark on both fronts. If you are an Australian who was caught right at the beginning of this COVID crash, the government—who are still the government today after these many months—decided that they didn't want to give you any support. Make no mistake about it. The government were very, very clear: 'Shut down the parliament. Go home. We're not doing anything. You're on your own.' That was their first instinct and their first response. It took battering, week after week, by the Australian Labor Party to stand up for the jobs of hardworking Australians. It was the Australian Labor Party leading the charge, not in the parliament because the government had shut that down, but out in the community with the fourth estate, trying to tell the stories of Australians who were doing it really, really tough very, very quickly. It was the businesses of this country. The big businesses and the small businesses were out there with their battering ram getting this tone-deaf government to hear them, saying: 'You cannot let all these people lose their jobs. You've got to put in place some sort of wage replacement.' So, thank you, big business. Thank you, small business. Thank you for standing up for the workers of this country, because the government were missing in action when it all started to come unstuck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pictures that happened on that fateful day this year, with queues of Australians who had never been unemployed in their lives standing outside Centrelink trying to get some help, hundreds of thousands of them, and the shock of that finally unblocked the deaf ears of this government. They decided: 'Oh my God, maybe the Labor Party were right, because they are the party of jobs. We can pretend to be, but Labor are the party of jobs. Maybe they were right. Maybe we should listen to the big businesses that have been telling us we've got it wrong. Maybe some of the small businesses might have something to say.' Eventually, after resistance, and a special call-back here to Canberra, legislation was passed that brought in the JobSeeker payment and gave succour and support to families who were starting to feel very vulnerable. That's the political reality of what happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, families have been managing. Some families have been managing quite well; they have resources. Other families, without resources, are struggling. Small businesses, with their houses on the line, with mortgage payments suspended, know what's going on. They know the challenges they're facing, and they're very concerned about what government's proposals for policy, going forward, will look like for them. We've got reports of insolvencies in small businesses building up. We are getting reports that, despite this being the cheapest money that people could ever get to invest in their business, there is a drop-off in investment in business, because people know what this government doesn't want to say: people in small business, with their lives on the line, their families on the line, the housing that they live in on the line, their businesses on the line and the jobs of the people they employ on the line, know that things are very fragile. And, in the midst of all that, we've got the spin. We've got all the job lines—JobSeeker, JobKeeper, JobMaker. I'll tell you what, you can put them all in one big bin, because what's really going on here is 'JobFaker'. These guys are great at spin but not at delivery.</span>

So disingenuous is this government, so unable to tell the truth to the Australian people is the minister, that they can't say straight out: 'We've cut JobSeeker. We've cut the amount of money we're giving you. That's our choice. It's the way we think about how money operates. We think that you've had enough for long enough. We didn't want to give it to you in the first place, and now we're going to turn the tap off. We're going to choke it a little bit at a time. We're going to put your family at risk and make you more and more vulnerable.' Day by day, the choke is on from this government.</span>

                  </a>  What we can see by this minister's reaction is actually quite good. There might be just a skerrick, a little, tiny bit, of truth still in there, and she can discern the reality of what she's doing—that she's laying out a con job on the Australian people. She keeps using this word 'extended'. I want Australians to understand that the government are going to tell you, about the money they said you needed, that they were going to help you out with to make sure you didn't fall foul of this COVID-19 crisis, that they're extending their support. They use that word in the most deceptive way to try and convince Australians that they're going to really look after them. They will never tell you that they're going to cut your support. It's only pressure from the Labor Party in this place that has made the government undertake that commitment to eke it out a little bit longer, although they're cutting it all the time. Until this week, Australians didn't know if they'd have any support come Christmas, If it wasn't for the Labor Party, standing up in this place for hardworking Australians who found themselves on JobSeeker and JobKeeper, there is no way this government would have given the 'extension' past Christmas, to March. Just remember that while they're extending past Christmas to March they are cutting support for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion we are debating is about the Reserve Bank. I trust it an awful lot more than I trust this government. This government have another set of words: 'mutual obligation'. They make it sound like it's a good thing that you should seek out multiple jobs every week and that if you don't get the right number of jobs or you make a mistake on the paperwork you're cut off. They think that's a good thing. I've sat through hearing after hearing with Senator Siewert hearing evidence from people who've been cut off—hundreds of thousands of families at risk all of the time, because this government set up a structure where it can cut you off with hardly a moment's notice. That's what's going on. Do you know what the government want you to do? They want you to apply for these jobs where you live. So you end up filling out your form and sending off your job application. Who do you send it to? You send it to all of the local businesses, the local businesses that have no jobs, the local businesses that we hear are lining up for potential insolvency, the local businesses who haven't got the time to do the paperwork and manage these floods and floods of people applying where there are no jobs. The lunacy of what the government have constructed, the intellectual and emotional burden for people to be playing that game while the government come in here and say, 'Everything's good'—it's totally disingenuous. It's a deception of the Australian people. It's a perfect example of the spin machine that is the Liberal Party right now—the spin machine led by the master of spin, none other than Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister, the prime minister of spin, the man who is making Australians who are down on their luck apply for job after job after job that doesn't exist, the man who's pushing that burden of managing all of that paperwork onto small businesses that are already doing it tough. That's what's really going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank put out a statement on monetary policy in November this year. It's pretty fresh off the press. Where they get their data from is not some spin machine. When they choose their words they don't choose words that they've workshopped to see if they can get away with telling lies. They actually rely on accurate data. This report I have in front of me has used record data from the HILDA Survey. The people who put that together are none other than the Australian National University. It's funded by the Department of Social Services. It's managed by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, the Australian Data Archive and the Australian National University. These are the people who gather the data to tell the truth about what's going on in Australia, not the spin that this government has made its signature.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know from the document, from the facts, from the evidence, from the data is that growth in employment, despite the government's constant claims—'It's all okay, don't worry about it. We're the Liberal government; it's all in control. We do everything financial superbly well'—is not good. Australians know they're not doing it well. Australians know that times are tough. They know that their families are vulnerable. We know from the Reserve Bank:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a very big difference between 'extended' and 'tapered'. This government tells us it has extended the scheme. The Reserve Bank tells us it's under threat because this government is actually tapering the payment and unemployment is expected to grow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pace of improvement in employment has slowed since August, because this government, which didn't want to commence the journey with Australians, was dragged kicking and screaming to provide support. Now, the government can't wait to cut off payments as quickly as it can and put people back on a path to poverty. That is the government's strategy, that is its goal and that is where it is headed. And that is where too many Australian families fear they will be at by or after Christmas, under this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak about a component of our income support system, the so-called process of mutual obligations, and our employment services. The cost of these services over the forward estimates is $6 billion or more. My argument is that we don't get good value for money for that $6 billion, which I think should be spent on providing much more tailored and supportive services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens welcomed the government pausing mutual obligations at the beginning of the pandemic and we strongly advocated that this was an opportunity to reset and take a new approach to support people looking for work, rather than punishing people already in vulnerable or disadvantaged positions while they were looking for work. We knew, with predictions coming in thick and fast, that we were going to get a huge rise in unemployment because of the pandemic. In fact, we've seen a doubling of the numbers of people on income support. We supported the increase in JobSeeker and the suspension of mutual obligations, because they were good moves. What I'm deeply disappointed about is the fact that this wasn't continued and it wasn't used to reset things—to actually have a look at how ineffective the punitive approach of mutual obligations is, how flawed the Targeted Compliance Framework is, how the demerit system under the Targeted Compliance Framework doesn't work and how it penalises people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was revealed at estimates, just a couple of weeks ago, that in less than 30 days of mutual obligations being reinstated on 25 September nearly 75,000 payments have been suspended by Centrelink. That's 75,000 in less than 30 days. This included 12,137 First Nations peoples, 6,334 single parents, 13,169 disabled people, 9,100 homeless people and 12,135 people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Clearly, many of these people are vulnerable. Clearly, this is disproportionately impacting those people who have a significant vulnerability. I'm absolutely at a loss to work out why it helps a homeless person find work if they are suspended from payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, what we had a couple of days ago, in this very chamber, was Minister Cash—almost bragging, I'd say—about the fact that 250,112 suspensions have been put in place in about six weeks. Let's have a look at what impact that has. It has a devastating impact when you're trying to survive, to meet your mortgage, to pay your rent, to put food on the table, particularly when $300 has just been taken out of the supplement payment. We saw today from the Taylor Fox analysis what impact that drop has made in just the couple of weeks that it's been operating. It has had a significant impact on the way people can pay their bills, because we know it has dropped people below the poverty line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government had a chance to reset things here, to get a system and to put employment services on track, to actually deliver value for the $6 billion that we spend in this country on those employment services. We could be offering a system that is supportive, not punitive; one that actually works with people's strengths, that actually looks at where the labour market opportunities are and that provides tailored counselling that meets their needs. What do we do? We go back to, 'Let's throw as many people off income support or suspend them as often as we can and as frequently as we can.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I rise to speak on the life of a great Australian hero and Central Coast local, Flight Lieutenant Stan Louis Donnellan. Stan had an incredible life. I particularly want to reflect on his service to this nation in World War II and the remarkable bond he made with the Bertelli family of Italy, which was rekindled 71 years after that relationship began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan enlisted in the RAAF in 1941, and he served until 1946 in the RAAF 232 Squadron. He flew the legendary Spitfire against Axis forces in the European theatre. On 11 June 1944, while on a mission escorting light bombers over Italy, Stan's plane crashed on the second part of the mission, which was to attack targets of opportunity on the ground. Stan ran into difficulty when he suddenly saw high-tension lines and hit the throttle with no response, but he had enough speed to get himself out of harm's way. Stan had the decision to bail out or to crash-land, of which he took the second option and proceeded to find somewhere to crash-land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the crash, Stan was found and taken in by Angiolino Bertelli and his family, who were affiliated with the anti-Nazi partisans. The Bertelli family hid him from German patrols on their Tuscan farm. I'm a little saddened, despite having the prestige of you hearing me give this speech, Mr President, that we don't have Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the chamber, because I know she's particularly familiar with that part of the world, and I'm sure she'd be very interested in this great affiliation between Australian and Italian partisans at the time. Stan stayed with the Bertellis for five weeks, who constantly risked their lives to keep him safe. As Stan himself described:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They were in grave danger all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Germans knew I was there somewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They kept searching for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once repatriated to England and then Australia, he married his English rose, Peggy, whom he met while she was working at a RAF pay office and to whom he was engaged when he went missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan was actually able to rekindle his incredible bond with the Bertellis when a story from the local <span style="font-style:italic;">Central Coast Express Advocate</span> about Bluey and Peggy's 70th anniversary was found by Angiolino's great grandson, Francesco Bertelli. Francesco said that his family had been searching for Stan for nearly seven decades and immediately they organised flights to see him. Francesco Bertelli and his father were able to visit Bluey on St Huberts Island in 2016 on the Central Coast, and they renewed their incredible bond born of compassion and grace in the terrible harshness of the Second World War. Francesco said of Stan, 'He taught me life is extraordinary.' Francesco also translated an account of their story found in Marzio Volpi's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Parchment and Other Stories</span> for Stan from its original Italian. Stan was also awarded the Medaille de la Legion D'honneur by the French government for his services in World War II to France on board a visiting French naval vessel in Sydney just a few years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stan Donnellan passed away in early September this year at the incredible age of 98. Stan left behind a treasure trove of memories and a world that is better for his brave and selfless service. The Central Coast and, indeed, all Australia are honoured by his memory. I pass my deepest condolences on to the Donnellan family, who are very prominent on the Central Coast and make great social contributions to our community. I also thank the Bertellis for their hospitality and their kindness on that day. Seeing a fellow human in distress, they provided the care and support that built a friendship that lasted over the entire century.</span>

I'm starting with Bangladesh, where Amnesty International reports that in 2019 more than 388 people were killed by the security forces in alleged extrajudicial executions. Amnesty also reports that the Digital Security Act severely restricts the work of journalists, activists, human rights defenders and others who face arrest for exercising their right to freedom of expression. In this context, I note that US senators have written a bipartisan letter calling for action to address extrajudicial killings, including by the Rapid Action Battalion, which is reported to be responsible for more than 400 killings. In their letter they wrote that extrajudicial killings have reportedly spiked since the government of Bangladesh began its war on drugs. They noted that UN experts consider that the war on drugs appears to be a deliberate policy of extrajudicial killings and they urged Bangladesh to respect the rule of law and human rights. Australia needs to be doing more to be supporting free and fair general elections in Bangladesh and to work for a democratic environment that will encourage people's participation and protect human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I want to move to Colombia, where we have heard devastating news of massacres of protesters. Since the signing of the peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or FARC, hundreds of people have been killed, including activists, human rights campaigners and environmental advocates. Recently, police opened fire on protesters in Bogota, killing multiple people and wounding dozens more. We urge the Colombian government to take every step possible to ensure that the lives and human rights of Colombian citizens are protected, including their right to protest safely.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, the Turkish government has issued warrants for 82 individuals over protests that occurred in 2014. We are very concerned about the Turkish government's use of criminal prosecutions as a way to silence their political opposition. This breaches fundamental human rights, and the Australian government must call on them to cease.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to move to Sri Lanka. I have heard from activists there who are concerned about the activities of an Australian mining company, Titanium Sands, on Mannar Island. Titanium Sands describe their project as 'a world-class mineral sands deposit' and said that it was located in a 'mining-friendly jurisdiction'. But a petition from people impacted by these activities in Sri Lanka speaks of a vulnerable, low-lying coastal area where tens of thousands of people live and depend on fishing for their livelihood. They told me that, if mining is allowed to proceed, this will spell the end of Mannar Island, 63 per cent of which is already below sea level. They tell of the destruction of old-growth forests, the impact on migratory birds and on fishing, and the increased salinity in wells and groundwater, as well as impacts on tourism and historic sites. Projects like this bring Australian businesses into disrepute, and pressure must be brought to bear on Titanium Sands to not proceed with this destructive project.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I turn to occupied Palestine. While the world's attention was focused on the US election, Israeli authorities demolished most of a Bedouin village in the occupied West Bank, displacing 73 Palestinians, including 41 children, in the largest such demolition in years. The UN estimates that 689 structures have been demolished across the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2020, leaving 869 Palestinians homeless. In parallel with this serious violation of international law, the Israeli government has been embarking on a settlement-building spree. These actions demonstrate that, although official annexation has been put on hold, the creeping annexation that we have seen for years by the Israeli government continues. This has grave consequences for the prospects of a peaceful solution to the conflict and for the human rights of Palestinians on the ground. </span>
