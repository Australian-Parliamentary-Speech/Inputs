                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a climate crisis. With scientists on the weekend saying that they are despairing at the possibility of delivering something close to a safe climate to our kids and grandkids, with people in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales still unable to get back into their homes after the devastating floods, with people in Queensland and Brisbane unable to afford to insure their houses because the risk of coal and gas fuelled floods is now so severe, and with the Great Barrier Reef bleaching yet again on the very same day that the Prime Minister and the resources minister turn up to celebrate the thousandth gas shipment going out of ports there, it is vital that today we debate now and call on the government to stop approving new coal and gas mines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is crystal clear now, after the announcements we've seen over the last few days, is that Labor want coal and gas past 2050, at a time when they told us they were going to get to zero pollution. They now want it past 2050. The environment minister has approved coalmines to run past 2050. The government now, in a cabinet endorsed gas strategy, says they want gas to 2050 and beyond. 2050 would have been too late to reach zero, but now we're not even going to reach it then, because Labor's policy, crystal clear, is to keep opening new coal and gas mines and have it running past 2050, even though every scientist is telling us that that is a recipe for catastrophic heatwaves and floods and fires for people who are going to primary school today. It means that during the lifetime of kids at primary school today they will see Australia lose its capacity to feed itself as the Murray-Darling Basin evaporates and becomes 92 per cent less productive than it is at the moment. It will mean they go to every school holidays and Christmas holidays worried about how many people are going to die in the heatwaves and bushfires that will hit that year, because this parliament and this government failed to get the climate crisis under control. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five new coal projects and eight new gas projects—that's what the Labor government have approved since they came to power. And now they have embraced Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister is now worse than Scott Morrison, pushing for new gas projects and having them go past 2050, at a time when we should be at absolutely zero pollution, if not much sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what, Mr Speaker? At 5.15 the day after parliament rose last time, after we had been sitting here for weeks debating gas, we found out that the environment minister had secretly approved the pipeline for the Beetaloo gas project. She didn't tell parliament about it. It just happened to become public the day after scrutiny could have been put on them in question time while parliament was sitting here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make a special mention of those lions in their electorates who are mice in the parliament, the members for Macnamara, Wills, Richmond, Cooper and Moreton, all of whom sat here and cheered on every one of those new coal and gas mines when they were approved. Now, apparently, they're saying that there's a problem with the government's gas strategy. Well, this is a chance to come and vote on it. There's one thing that you get here that everyday people don't get: when you come to parliament, you get your vote. People want to know whether you're going to vote for more coal and gas mines or vote against them. This is a chance now to put your money where your mouth is and be on the right side of history. Stop approving new coal and gas mines. Come and vote with those of us in the Greens and on the crossbench who know the science and want to stop seeing this climate crisis get worse. If you don't—if your party doesn't let you—then quit your party. It is crystal clear now that Labor's policy is for more coal and gas past 2050, unless we stop them with this motion today and a commitment from the government that they will stop opening new coal and gas projects.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CHANDLER-MATHER:</span>
                  </a>  We hear objections immediately; it feels like we maybe touched a nerve again. Firstly, they let gas corporations get away with paying next to no tax. On income tax, Santos pays less income tax than anyone watching this at home. We also know that Santos last year wrote to the Labor resource minister asking for changes to environmental approvals to allow them to accelerate the approval of the Barossa gas project, and then Labor did just that, overriding the wishes of First Nations people and serious environmental concerns. Any other constituent in Australia would love the idea that they could write to the minister and then immediately get what they want. What about all the people on JobSeeker writing to the minister, asking to have their payments raised above the poverty line, or the people stuck on waiting lists or the renters out there? They get ignored. But, if you're the CEO of Santos, you get exactly what you want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this new gas strategy is something of which every Labor member in this place should be deeply, deeply ashamed. I frankly do not know how anyone on that side of the House can sleep at night. Expanding gas production out past 2050 basically locks in catastrophic climate change. One of the lies that are perpetrated in this place, or these mistruths, is that Australia only has a small part to play when tackling climate change. Australia is one of the biggest exporters of fossil fuels in the world. In fact, the two countries that beat us are Saudi Arabia and Russia, which are hardly wonderful company to have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's get this straight. The Labor Party is now going to spend public money expanding gas production out past 2050—gas production, by the way, that produces methane that is 80 times more potent in warming the planet than CO2. They let gas corporations get away with paying next to no tax. They're going to give them public money to do it. They roll over when the Labor resource minister gets written to by the CEO of Santos. It's incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On taxes, by the way, we're about to have a federal budget, so let's talk about taxes for a second. Over a seven-year period, Santos made $28.9 billion in income. They paid an effective tax rate on that of 0.02 per cent. Eighty-two per cent of all the gas produced in Australia is exported overseas. So, really, what's remarkable about this—what is so destructive—is that they are pursuing a gas strategy that allows large multinational corporations, like Santos, Chevron and Woodside, to export enormous amounts of gas overseas, pay no tax on it, destroy the planet and hurt everyone other than the CEOs of Santos and Woodside. That's who the Labor Party is picking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's think about Norway for a second. Some members of this place will say, 'It's very hard to tax gas corporations.' Norway manages it. In 2023, there was $209 billion earned in the Norwegian gas industry. They paid an effective tax rate of 63 per cent. In Australia, in the same year, gas corporations made $164 billion of revenue but only paid tax on that, plus royalties, at a rate of nine per cent. If those gas corporations in Australia paid the same tax rate as they did in Norway, in a single year the Australian government would have earned an extra $88.8 billion in revenue. That would fund putting dental into Medicare and completely solve the housing crisis by funding a mass construction of public housing. We could coordinate a freeze on rent increases. We could make university education free. We could wipe student debt. We could raise the poverty payments that the government forces people to live on, like JobSeeker, above the poverty line. We could do all of that. We could fundamentally improve people's lives and we could fund a transition plan out of coal and gas in the medium term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, this government is raising more money from student debt than they are from gas taxes, expanding gas production out past 2050 and approving coalmines that will be mining coal out to 2070—and expecting Australians to put up with it. Functionally what the Labor Party is doing in this place is acting as the political representative of Woodside, Santos and the entire gas industry.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at the evidence. There are record low taxes for gas corporations, which see Santos pay a lower percentage tax rate than a cleaner, a teacher or a nurse; they all pay a higher percentage tax rate than Santos does. There's public money to help Santos and Woodside do what they want to do—expand gas production and destroy the planet. At the end of all of this, what do we get? The world's scientists have said that warming is going to expand past 1½ degrees, and God only knows what's going to happen as warming surges past 2½ degrees and three degrees. And many members of this place won't have to be here to suffer the consequences. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I8M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  Let me be absolutely clear: this government is fully committed to climate action and net zero by 2050. This government is fully committed to 82 per cent renewables by 2030. Since we came to office, there's been a 25 per cent increase in renewables in the national energy market, and this has driven both total emissions and emissions intensity to all-time record lows. We've doubled the rate of approvals for energy projects and provided over $1 billion for homes and businesses to upgrade their energy efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Greens don't want to talk about that. The Greens don't want to talk about the enormous progress that has been made on climate change, during this Labor government, after 10 years of inactivity. Instead, they want to stand up and make a range of outrageous slurs against Labor and against Labor MPs. They want to stand there and make a series of outlandish claims. The reason for that is the Greens are fearful of one thing above all, and that is a sensible and practical path to address climate change. If we have a sensible and practical path to address climate change, we won't have the politics of outrage and we won't have the ability for them to make the perfect the enemy of the good. They are happy when the Liberals are in government, doing nothing on climate change, because it gives them the ability to rev up the outrage politics of climate change. That's why they're so annoyed about sensible, practical, middle-of-the-road climate change policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw this firsthand. In 2009 and 2010, I worked on the then Labor government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which was a plan to put an emissions trading scheme into Australia for the first time, a plan that would have been world leading and would have made a massive difference to Australia over the last 15 years. Who opposed it? The Greens. And why did they oppose it? Because sensible, methodical progress on climate change is anathema to the politics that they want to run on this issue. Time and time again, the Greens are opposed to sensible and practical change. Time and time again, the Greens make the perfect the enemy of the good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for that is there is nothing worse for their political strategy than having positive progress, the kind of positive progress that this government has implemented over the last two years: making a real difference on renewables; making a real difference on transmission; signing up to ambitious targets; bringing the business sector and the rest of the community, including the unions, together around a national target that it can actually deliver; signing back up to our international commitments; and being a leader on the world stage in climate change. All of this is exactly what the Greens do not want—practical, sensible change. That's why they're trying to whip up outrage on this issue. That's why, first thing in after the break: bang, they're into the suspension of standing orders; bang, full of outrage; bang, lots of slurs against individual Labor MPs; bang, lots of outrage in the speech. All of it is because the thing they fear most is practical, real change that makes the politics of outrage irrelevant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we are going to continue on this path. We are going to continue to methodically and practically work through the challenges to address the climate crisis in this nation and around the world. We have seen more progress in two years than was able to be achieved in the last 10 years, more progress in two years than was able to be achieved in the entire period of Liberal government and, I'm sorry to say, more progress in two years than was achieved in the last Labor government, when we made the mistake of thinking the Greens were fair dinkum on climate change. We made that mistake, and look what happened. They wouldn't support an emissions-trading scheme in this country. How the world would have been different, how Australia would have been different, if they hadn't made the perfect the enemy of the good. They voted against the CPRS then, and that is exactly the tactic they have right now. That was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address climate change in this country, to put us on a sensible path towards a clean energy future. The Greens took that off the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Griffith stood up a moment ago and said, 'It's a mistake to think that Australia only has a small role to play in addressing global climate change.' We agree. We think Australia has a big role. That's why it's such a shame that back in 2010 the Greens stopped Australia from playing that role, from putting in a world-leading emissions-trading scheme. And that's why it's such a shame that they're trying to scupper the sensible, practical progress that has been made in Australia in the last two years. They don't want Australia playing that role on the world stage. They preferred it back when Australia was making no progress, under the Morrison government. In fact, the Leader of the Greens just a moment ago said, 'This government is worse than Scott Morrison.' Well, it's worse than Scott Morrison for him, friends, because, by doing sensible, practical things to address climate change, we're taking away the politics of outrage. He loved Scott Morrison. He loved the coal in the parliament. That enabled him to really rev up the outrage, to dial it up to 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're not seeing them come into this parliament and make any attacks on the Liberals' positions and we're not seeing them come in and support Labor's sensible positions. What we see instead is them pursuing the politics of outrage, because they don't want progress on climate change. Sensible, practical policies are their enemy, and they have always been their enemy. That's why they don't come in here and talk about the change that has occurred in Australia over the last 10 years and they don't attack Peter Dutton for his ridiculous, scandalous neglect on climate change. Australia is making progress, and they want to attack the government for that progress. What they would love is a world in which no progress was made, and they could go back to revving up the politics of outrage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the difference. Labor is going to make practical, methodical change. We've made an enormous amount of progress in the last two years, and that is incredibly important to Australians. In my electorate, we face enormous consequences from climate change. In Parramatta, people are already paying the price with the impacts of climate change. Every summer, Parramatta gets almost 10 degrees hotter than the rest of Sydney. In 2019, one out of every eight days were above 35 degrees. And Parramatta is prone to catastrophic flooding—natural disasters that are getting worse and worse. In some of the published scenarios, up to 25 per cent of Parramatta could become a flood zone. That's why the people of Parramatta have been working to deliver a climate adaptation plan, a plan that addresses the local impacts of climate change and supports our progress in dealing with those impacts of climate change while at the same time the government gets on with mitigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we delivered our Parramatta climate action plan, a plan supported by members of the community and community groups from across the electorate, distilling 137 community led recommendations into a plan that we can action over the next several years. That's sensible, methodical progress on climate change—real, practical action. At a local level, I'm so proud of the people of Parramatta for coming together on that plan. That practical, methodical plan is exactly the opposite of the politics of outrage that we see from the Greens as they come into this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in a decade we have a government taking climate change seriously. For the first time in a decade we have Australia back at the international table. For the first time in a decade we've got renewables going up. For the first time in a decade we have consensus from business groups, union groups and community groups on the need to address climate change. The people who cannot bear that consensus, the people who are completely opposed to that, who recognise it as the biggest threat to their political strategy are the Australian Greens political party. No wonder they've come into this House and expressed such outrage.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I stand to support this motion condemning the Future Gas Strategy and calling on the environment minister and the resources minister to stop approving new coal and gas projects. I'm not into the politics of outrage, but I am fond of common sense. Gas does have a role in the transition. It is better than coal and it is a good firming fuel while we are working out the technology that we need to be truly net zero. We do need some gas during transition. It needs to be a fraction of the gas we're using today. We need to use as little gas as possible for as short a time as possible. This Future Gas Strategy is not a transition strategy; it is an expansion strategy.</span>

                  </a>  This is not a transition strategy; it is an expansion strategy. We cannot expand gas all the way to net zero. It just does not make sense. In Western Australia at the moment we are experiencing a forest collapse event. There are dead trees all over my electorate that have not lasted through the summer, despite having lasted for 100 years before that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we need to reduce the use of gas. Gas is only part of the transition if it's replacing coal, not if it's replacing renewables. The danger is if we invest in gas projects now, hoping that the world will prefer our gas to our competitors' gas, we end up with too much gas and then gas becomes cheaper and it starts replacing renewables instead. We cannot use short-term issues to justify making bad long-term decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This strategy is not presented in the context that it's as little as possible for as short a time as possible. It's not clear how this strategy fits with our international climate obligations, with driving reduction in demand for gas and with prioritising domestic needs over export. We export 90 per cent of our Western Australian gas offshore. We get little tax for that; the profits go overseas and it contributes to an unlivable planet. We are not sending a clear message to the investment community that we are serious about decarbonisation. It's a very mixed message, saying: 'We're expanding gas. We're open for business to 2050 and beyond. Oh, but we are also trying to incentivise renewables.' We need clear signals here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Kohler points out that this raises the question: what is the point of all the other work we're doing to reduce emissions when it is all undone by these huge gas projects? That is why this future gas strategy is not consistent with a livable planet; it is not consistent with Australia being committed to decarbonisation. I condemn it and I call on the environment minister and the resource minister to stop approving new coal and gas mines.</span>

The Australian Academy of Science has said that global warming to three degrees and beyond is disastrous.</span>

There is severe food and water shortage and people are eating grass to survive. In this moment of severe vulnerability, Israel has accused UNRWA of terrorism without providing any proof. UNRWA is the last aid provider which is standing between Palestinian people and a famine. Our very own foreign minister Penny Wong admitted that Australia dont have any facts regarding the UNRWA allegations. But Australia was quick to disconnect funding to UNRWA based on just allegations. On the other hand, ICJ ruled that there is a plausible genocide being committed by Israel, based on court hearings and real, hard evidence. But Australia remains silent in supporting the ICJ of the oppressed side.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As our lives become increasingly dependent upon online interactions and communication, so too increases our risk of online abuse and illegal activity stemming from predatory behaviour. Areas that commonly receive attention and action are fraudulent online activity and phishing scams. However of particular concern is the rise in people using online platforms to perpetrate domestic violence including abuse, control and stalking behaviour. Additionally, predatory child exploitation and abuse crimes are occurring with increasing frequency. There are many loopholes within our state and national frameworks that render current laws essentially non-enforceable, and it is near-impossible for criminals to be successfully charged with their cyber crimes. The issues are multifaceted but it is pertinent that we address them to prevent an exponential rise in these effectively unpunishable crimes, and the damage caused to victims as a result.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to create a national framework and revise current laws, in order to hold criminals accountable, and ensure that online platforms co-operate with law enforcement. Circumstantial evidence needs to be held in higher regard for cybercrime, including DV related cybercrime and online crimes involving children. The reality is that people commit these crimes in private, and even when the IP address is traceable, the respondent can avoid prosecution by saying they weren't in possession of that device at that time. We ask that Australia takes this stand to improve online safety for our citizens, and protect victims, instead of encouraging this new uprising in safeguarded criminals.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">With a user's nicotine addiction gone, the habit may remain as a source of comfort and a way to alleviate stress without relapsing with nicotine. The government's plan to unilaterally ban nicotine free liquids will ultimately hurt those who used vapes the right way, not kids, not illegal users, but legal adults making a choice to use a product that doesn't harm them.</span>

The vapes supplied by pharmacies are also ludicrously high in nicotine, and will directly funnel those who have successfully kicked nicotine back into the arms of addiction.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Regional South Australia is currently facing a significant lack of public transport options, particularly in the realm of passenger rail services. With the cessation of Australian National Railways Commission operations in 1998, South Australia's regional rail network has suffered, leading to decreased connectivity, economic stagnation, and environmental concerns. The absence of viable rail services has placed undue burdens on residents, hindering access to essential services, limiting employment opportunities, and impeding regional growth.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to acknowledge the vital role of regional passenger rail in fostering economic prosperity, enhancing social cohesion, and mitigating environmental impacts. We urge the Federal Government to collaborate with the South Australian Government to facilitate the repair and revitalisation of regional passenger rail infrastructure. This includes providing financial assistance, technical expertise, and policy support to re-establish and modernise regional rail services, ensuring sustainable and equitable transportation options for all Australians. By prioritising the restoration of regional passenger rail, the Federal Government can demonstrate its commitment to fostering inclusive development, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting the prosperity of regional communities. Furthermore, we urge the House to conduct a comprehensive review of national rail policies and funding mechanisms to address systemic challenges hindering the viability of regional passenger rail services across Australia. By implementing supportive regulatory frameworks and investing in innovative solutions, the Federal Government can ensure the long-term sustainability and accessibility of regional rail networks, fulfilling its duty to facilitate equitable transportation infrastructure for all Australians.</span>

They made the decisions and you pay the price. Allowing people to access their super to pay off or pay down their mortgage will slash their interest payments (if not eliminate them), bring much need funds back into the household budget, while also giving back a sense of control to peoples lives. When household ownership is a key indicator to the quality of one's retirement, it makes zero sense to pay 10s of thousands in interest now, when you won't see those returns by retirement and may even be in the situation where you still need to use your super to pay off the house. This would only apply to the first home owners. Investors or those with multiple properties would not be able to access their super, even if they reside in the house that still has a mortgage over it. If the government of the day was serious about helping people now this would be a common sense and immediate impact they can make without having to print money and further fuel inflation—super is your money you worked for! </span>

The current laws suppress the rights of australians who seek to quite smoking for a safer alternative that research shows is not nearly as damaging to the body as smoking.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source, presenting a viable solution to combatting climate change by significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Embracing nuclear power enhances our energy security by providing a stable and reliable energy supply, thus reducing our dependence on volatile global energy markets. The economic benefits are substantial, with the potential for job creation, technological innovation, and increased investments in the nuclear energy sector contributing to overall economic growth. Additionally, the adoption of nuclear power positions Australia as a leader in nuclear science and engineering, fostering technological advancements with applications across various industries. Stringent safety standards and regulations ensure the secure operation of modern nuclear power plants, addressing concerns about safety. I urge a comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility of nuclear power in Australia, emphasizing the potential environmental, economic, and technological advantages that this energy source could bring to our nation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Children in Australian libraries face exposure to explicit content, featuring graphic depictions of sexual acts in both text and enticing illustrations. Alarming is the absence of age restrictions and bypassing of the Classification Review Board's scrutiny, violating the Classification Act of 1995. Public Service Commissioner Peter Woolcott's October 25th, 2022, Child Safety Statement underscores a zero-tolerance stance on child abuse. The pervasive explicit materials can be seen as a form of child grooming, jeopardizing children's safety. Unlike adults, children lack the developed filter to discern inappropriate content and may succumb to peer pressure. The petition calls for these explicit publications to be confined to restricted areas, safeguarding children from unrestricted access.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to to take immediate action, proposing comprehensive measures for handling sexually explicit publications in public and school libraries. Firstly, explicit materials should be removed from open display, accessible only upon request and confined to restricted areas. Minors seeking such content must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. The definition of sexually explicit publications is detailed, encompassing various forms of explicit content. Additionally, legally restricted publications should be entirely removed from library catalogs. A thorough audit of libraries for "Submittable Publications" is recommended, with any meeting the criteria sent for classification review. Emphasizing consistent classification across formats, the petition calls for a proactive approach to protect children from explicit content.</span>

Founded in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, this group claims that Lee is the one true pastor prophesied to appear at end times.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Workforce planning anticipates a future nursing workforce deficit of 123,000 nurses by 2030. Under current clinical placement arrangements, students complete between 800 and 1200 hours of unpaid clinical placement as a mandatory component in the Bachelor of Nursing. Although unpaid work experience is illegal in Australia, students are required to complete upwards of 800 hours of unpaid work for educational purposes. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Students completing clinical placement experience significant financial hardship, as they either need to complete paid work outside of full time clinical placement and risk patient safety, or not earn an income for several weeks. Healthcare students struggle to afford rent, travel, and food costs during unpaid clinical placement and there is an increased reliance on emergency and food relief organisations. Financial hardships including increased cost of living, slow wage growth, and HECS debt indexing at 7.1% additionally impact students, and is another barrier impacting healthcare students during unpaid clinical placements. This barrier is preventing students from completing healthcare qualifications, and causing students to enter the workforce in significant debt. </span>

We kindly request for the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) debt reduction program to be expanded to include all health workers completing unpaid clinical placements. Waiving the HECS debts of healthcare workers recognises the unpaid morning, afternoon, and night shift contributions made by healthcare students, and ensures that the system that enables unpaid clinical placement is retired. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The role of plan management is under threat. Plan managers are a legislated role supporting National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Participants by reducing their administrative burden. Almost 400,000 Participants (62%) choose to use a plan manager to handle the payment of $19.2b/yr (50%) for their supports. Of that amount, plan managers only receive $511mil/yr, but the work they do is priceless.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Plan management provides an additional level of independent accountability and visibility for taxpayers' funds for a low fixed fee (&lt;2.0%). This essential financial oversight is subject to registration standards, pricing limits, and audits, with the highest scrutiny of all fund management methods.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS Review recommends the removal of plan management and plan managers. Instead, recommending the introduction of a digital payments platform, and combining multiple support roles into one 'system navigator' role. This decision will directly affect Participants as well as their nominees and carers, forcing them to take on the additional administrative burden and reducing their support, regardless of their choice or capabilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Plan Management is about so much more than paying the bills. Ironically, even the NDIS Review Final Report says "Plan Managers still have an important role to play in supporting prevention, detection, and response to non-compliance, sharp practice, and fraud."</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned, advocate for the inclusion of Belzutifan on the PBS to provide hope and improved outcomes for VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) patients. VHL is a rare, predominantly inherited cancer caused by a genetic mutation, affecting 1 in 36,000 individuals in Australia. The mutation leads to various cancers, including pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer, haemangioblastoma, phaechromocytomas, renal cell carcinoma, and endolymphatic sac tumors.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">VHL falls under Neuroendocrine Cancers, with over 5,500 Australians diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Tumours (NETs) annually. NETs collectively rank as the 7th most diagnosed cancer in Australia. Presently, surgery or radiation therapy are the only available treatments for VHL, focusing on tumour removal without controlling growth.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Belzutifan, a proven effective medication available in the US and parts of the UK, is NOT accessible in Australia through the PBS, despite TGA approval and orphan drug classification. Affordability issues arise as Belzutifan costs $12,000 per month out of pocket.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

However, my joy is turning into sorrow as one of my rabbits has been infected with myxomatosis and the other is likely to follow suit.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Myxomatosis is a lethal virus that affects rabbits, causing severe suffering before leading to death. In Australia, despite the availability of a vaccine overseas, it remains illegal due to fears it could interfere with population control measures for wild rabbits—an invasive species here.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">It's time we revisited these regulations and found a balanced solution that values both environmental concerns and animal welfare. Let's give domestic rabbits in Australia a fighting chance against myxomatosis by legalising its vaccine.</span>

The facility has been used to spy on global citizens, and organise criminal bombings on countries such as Cambodia. The US has interfered with our sovereignty by dismissing Gough Whitlam for threatening to close Pine Gap, thus showcasing a complete lack of respect for our sovereignty. Pine Gap is a threat to global privacy, world peace, and Australian sovereignty. Australia is a sovereign country of its own right, and is not simply an empty plot of land for the US to use to further its own agenda. It does not protect Australia, but rather makes it more vulnerable, and it is not in our sovereign interests to continue to maintain such a facility.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Dept of Ageing has advised that the Seniors Village Hub program under the Seniors Connected Program will cease from 30th June 2024. The current 12 locations have created safe and inclusive hubs of activities for Seniors who may have otherwise been socially isolated. The current sites have shown that with minimal core operating expenses that a large amount of Seniors have reconnected with their communities and peers, have demonstrated a reduction in mental health (therefore decreasing costs to Dept of Health by way of presentation to GP surgeries and Hospitals), increased capacity to engage in their communities (increased participation within local economics), attend social support independently (reduce costs to Aged Care packages).</span>

The current model has shown a reduction on Aged Care Funding for Social Support and has empowered Seniors across the Country.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The supposed $12-$18,000 tax for new 4wd Utes will cause some vehicle manufacturers to leave Australia. Isuzu has already suggested that they may leave due to this new tax. This new tax is to push people to drive electric vehicles, these aren't for everyone and don't suit the needs of many, if not most, Australian. Australia has a very large 4wd community and almost every second car on the road is a 4wd vehicle. Not only that, but the secondhand market for electric vehicles is almost non-existent due to the cost of replacing the lithium batteries used to power these cars. Most electric cars go to scrap yards after 5-10 years due to the cost of replacing those batteries. 4wds are used in Australia for many things including recreational, farm work, holiday travel and even search and rescue missions by police. A lot of families purchase 4wd vehicles to be able to access remote locations to see the beautiful hidden gems this country has to offer, those sites will simply not be accessible with electric vehicles. Some trails to access these locations include things like water crossings and rock climbs. Lithium batteries will not survived the impact of rocks or being submerged under water and will cause a lot more damage to the environment.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike many countries around the world, Australia does not have free University education, welfare payments, or even living cost loans for students. Students are studying full-time 40 hours a week, and yet we are still somehow supposed to make a living wage? </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Unless your parents earn below the poverty line, you cannot get any money from Centrelink if you are under 22. You can only get full payments if they together earn less than $62,000, and you receive nothing if they earn around $110,000 (well below the federal average wage).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And so, what happens to those students who receive no Centrelink or parental support, and need to leave home to study? We are forced to work near to full-time, while studying full time. How are students supposed to study while also having the time commitments and stress of supporting themselves financially? </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia paints itself as a society where anyone can achieve anything. But keeping up full-time work and study is not remotely sustainable. A lot of people have to make the choice, and so many are forced to give up on higher education. A massive barrier to education exists. This barrier applies to people of all backgrounds, whose parents do not want to and cannot contribute to the costs of them living while studying.</span>

The potential for AI to perpetuate and exacerbate violations of human rights and dignity underscores this urgency. AI-generated content, including deepfakes and AI-model/talent images, are being used in increasingly harmful ways—from spreading misinformation and manipulating public opinion to infringing on personal rights and exploiting images for illegal activities.

              <span class="HPS-Small">It is well established that children generally don't understand the gravity of their behaviour. Those facing the justice system in Australia are the most disadvantaged. Incarcerating them perpetuates harm and trauma, and may lead to ongoing criminalisation. Evidence shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are disproportionately targeted and harmed due to systemic and institutional racism. State and Territory Governments in Australia are are 26 times more likely to imprison these children than their non-Indigenous peers. The global minimum standard of 14 is based on neurotypical kids, but many who come into contact with the legal system have disabilities and impairments which require additional healthcare, support and understanding. Impaired children are being held in solitary confinement across the country, breaching UN Conventions on Torture and the Rights of the Child. The Australian Government must commit to funding therapeutic and non-punitive programs that keep children away from the legal system and out of prison. In place of the institutional failure we need community-driven solutions, intensive family support programs, trauma-informed mentorship and on-country learning that supports children so that they learn from their mistakes. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A permanent ceasefire is urgently needed in Gaza in order to bring an end to the terrible suffering and loss of life there, and enable a peaceful resolution in the region. We condemn both the terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians by armed Palestinian groups, and the Israeli Defence Force's attacks on Palestinian civilians and blockade of the Gaza strip which has prevented water, food, electricity and urgent medical supplies from entering. The Geneva Conventions and other instruments of the international human rights framework were introduced to ensure that such atrocities do not occur. It is essential that governments call on both sides of the conflict to adhere to these principles, cease all attacks on civilians, release all hostages and ensure the protection of human rights throughout the region. It will be necessary for Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and to lift its blockade. A comprehensive arms embargo should be imposed on all parties to the conflict, and the International Criminal Court's ongoing investigation into the situation should receive full support. The root cause of the conflict needs to to be addressed, including through dismantling Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a well-known and widely recognized fact that President Vladimir Putin has committed numerous crimes against his own people and the people of other nations. These crimes include politically motivated murders, such as the recent assassination of Alexei Navalny, repression against Putin's political opponents and against ordinary citizens who do not agree with his policies, torture of political prisoners, suppression of freedom of speech, usurpation of power, election rigging, unlawful alteration of the Russian Constitution, initiation of aggressive wars, and spreading aggressive propaganda among both Russians and the international community. This March, Russian authorities are holding so called presidential elections, which are organised with brutal violations of democratic principles and the rule of law. This procedure is also being conducted in the territories of Ukraine which are currently occupied by Russia. There is no doubt that Putin will proclaim himself the winner of these elections. We firmly believe that Australia must respond to Putin's blatant attempts to usurp power. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. Millions of Falun Gong practitioners in China have been fired, jailed, tortured or killed by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999. There have been persistent reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in China, primarily practitioners of Falun Gong. The Independent China Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, concluded in its Final Judgement in 2019: "Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one—and probably the main—source of organ supply" and that crimes against humanity against Falun Gong have been proved "beyond reasonable doubt". </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to request the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Australian Government to: 1. Pass a motion or make a statement to openly request an immediate end to the 20-year persecution of Falun Gong in China and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience; 2. Urge China to immediately end the practice of organ harvesting from all prisoners of conscience and conduct a thorough public education campaign to ensure Australians do not unknowingly participate in forced organ harvesting in China; 3. Deny visas and bar entry to Chinese officials and policemen who are involved in the persecution of Falun Gong.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, prior to COVID-19 international travel restrictions which came into effect in March 2020, individuals were generally limited to just one subclass 485 visa in a lifetime as a primary holder.

The actions in the Migration Strategy deliver a better managed migration system and are expected to help return migration to near pre-pandemic levels. The Government is recalibrating student and graduate visa settings to support both the education sector and Australia's migration needs and have decided the Replacement Stream and will be abolished, expected to happen mid-2024.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst I acknowledge the petitioners' concerns and the proposals outlined in the petition, it is important to note that Australia's migration legislation, which prescribes the eligibility criteria to apply for and be granted a visa (generally) does not provide for the grant of a visa without an application and undergoing the associated assessment processes to determine eligibility for that visa.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 11 September 2023 regarding petition number EN5265 calling for the Australian Government to denounce Israel and impose sanctions because of the current conflict in Gaza. I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player. I regularly raise Australia's view and press for progress towards peace in my engagements with counterparts in the Middle East, with partners including in Europe, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our region, as well as in multilateral forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my visit to the region earlier this year, I made clear Australia's view that achieving peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians requires a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The status quo is failing everyone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express Australia's serious concern about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have consistently emphasised that international law must be upheld—and that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas, and to condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. I have expressed our concern for hostages directly to families when I met with them in Australia and in Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express our grave concern at indications Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. About 1.7 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from a major military operation would be catastrophic. Our message to Israel is: do not go down this path.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I was in the West Bank, I met with Palestinian victims of violence by Israeli settlers. I made clear to my counterparts that this violence must cease and perpetrators must be held accountable. We consistently affirm that settlements are illegal under international law and a major impediment to peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is using our voice to advocate for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate need, and to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region. While in Jordan, I announced an additional $21.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March, we announced that Australia will also support efforts by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster will deliver a supply of 140 Australian Defence Force aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also providing an additional $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children, and $2 million to the new mechanism of the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These announcements bring Australia's total humanitarian contribution since this conflict began to $52.5 million and is in addition to Australia's core funding of $20.6 million for UNRWA, which has already been provided for this financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The humanitarian crisis and the catastrophic consequences of regional escalation underlines why we are using our voice to advocate for parties to avoid the conflict spreading.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My engagements in the region underlined how heavily this conflict weighs on the peoples of this region.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and New Zealand made clear in a recent joint statement that we respect the independence of the International Court of Justice and the critical role it plays in upholding international law and the rules-based order. Decisions of the ICJ are binding on the parties to the case. Our shared expectation is that Israel act in accordance with the ICJ's ruling, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">My engagements in the region underlined how heavily this conflict weighs on the peoples of this region. We mourn every Israeli and Palestinian innocent life which has been lost in this conflict and will continue to use our voice to support steps to peace in the region.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email regarding petition number <span style="font-style:italic;">EN5629, </span>regarding Australia's presence in Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Two years on since Russia's full-scale invasion, the Australian Government continues to unequivocally support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have committed approximately $960 million in support to Ukraine, including $780 million in military assistance and $75 million in humanitarian funding to help meet the urgent needs of the Ukrainian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have repeatedly condemned Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, and we will continue to work with partners to maintain pressure on Russia. Australia has imposed a comprehensive suite of measures to hold Russia to account, including through 1,200+ sanctions, import and export bans and multilateral pressure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Embassy to Ukraine continues to manage Australia's interests effectively from Warsaw. Australia's Embassy to Ukraine plays a vital role in supporting the provision of of Australian assistance to Ukraine. This is supported by active and close coordination between the Australian Government and Ukraine's Ambassador in Canberra.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the reopening of the Australian Embassy in Kyiv, the situation in Ukraine remains complex and challenging. Each country must work through its own safety and security considerations when it comes to managing its interests in Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is keeping the location of the Embassy under regular review. Consistent with usual practice for operations in challenging security environments, DFAT continues to undertake thorough security, and work health and safety risk assessments to ensure appropriate measures can be put in place to support operations in Kyiv.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has limited its bilateral engagement with Russia since its illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Australia maintains channels of communication with Russia in order to convey our strong opposition to the war as well as to communicate measures we have taken to ensure Russia pays a heavy price for its invasion. Our Embassy in Moscow also continues to provide consular assistance to Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I hope this information has been of assistance.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 regarding petition number EN5632 concerning the Israel-Hamas conflict. I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player. I regularly raise Australia's view and press for progress towards peace in my engagements with counterparts in the Middle East, with partners including in Europe, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our region, as well as in multilateral forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my visit to the region earlier this year, I made clear Australia's view that achieving peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians requires a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The status quo is failing everyone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express Australia's serious concern about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have consistently emphasised that international law must be upheld—and that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas, and to condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. I have expressed our concern for hostages directly to families when I met with them in Australia and in Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express our grave concern at indications Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. About 1.7 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from a major military operation would be catastrophic. Our message to Israel is: do not go down this path.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I was in the West Bank, I met with Palestinian victims of violence by Israeli settlers. I made clear to my counterparts that this violence must cease and perpetrators must be held accountable. We consistently affirm that settlements are illegal under international law and a major impediment to peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is using our voice to advocate for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate need, and to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region. While in Jordan, I announced an additional $21.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March, we announced that Australia will also support efforts by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster will deliver a supply of 140 Australian Defence Force aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also providing an additional $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children, and $2 million to the new mechanism of the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These announcements bring Australia's total humanitarian contribution since this conflict began to $52.5 million and is in addition to Australia's core funding of $20.6 million for UNRWA, which has already been provided for this financial year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 regarding petition number EN5654 calling on the Government to advocate for an immediate ceasefire in all wars. I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player. I regularly raise Australia's view and press for progress towards peace in my engagements with counterparts in the Middle East, with partners including in Europe, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our region, as well as in multilateral forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my visit to the region earlier this year, I made clear Australia's view that achieving peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians requires a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The status quo is failing everyone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express Australia's serious concern about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have consistently emphasised that international law must be upheld—and that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas, and to condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. I have expressed our concern for hostages directly to families when I met with them in Australia and in Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express our grave concern at indications Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. About 1.7 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from a major military operation would be catastrophic. Our message to Israel is: do not go down this path.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I was in the West Bank, I met with Palestinian victims of violence by Israeli settlers. I made clear to my counterparts that this violence must cease and perpetrators must be held accountable. We consistently affirm that settlements are illegal under international law and a major impediment to peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is using our voice to advocate for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate need, and to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region. While in Jordan, I announced an additional $21.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March, we announced that Australia will also support efforts by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster will deliver a supply of 140 Australian Defence Force aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also providing an additional $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children, and $2 million to the new mechanism of the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These announcements bring Australia's total humanitarian contribution since this conflict began to $52.5 million and is in addition to Australia's core funding of $20.6 million for UNRWA, which has already been provided for this financial year.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 regarding petition number EN5694 concerning the Israel-Hamas conflict. I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player. I regularly raise Australia's view and press for progress towards peace in my engagements with counterparts in the Middle East, with partners including in Europe, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our region, as well as in multilateral forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my visit to the region earlier this year, I made clear Australia's view that achieving peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians requires a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The status quo is failing everyone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express Australia's serious concern about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have consistently emphasised that international law must be upheld—and that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas, and to condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. I have expressed our concern for hostages directly to families when I met with them in Australia and in Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express our grave concern at indications Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. About 1.7 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from a major military operation would be catastrophic. Our message to Israel is: do not go down this path.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I was in the West Bank, I met with Palestinian victims of violence by Israeli settlers. I made clear to my counterparts that this violence must cease and perpetrators must be held accountable. We consistently affirm that settlements are illegal under international law and a major impediment to peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is using our voice to advocate for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate need, and to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region. While in Jordan, I announced an additional $21.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March, we announced that Australia will also support efforts by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster will deliver a supply of 140 Australian Defence Force aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also providing an additional $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children, and $2 million to the new mechanism of the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These announcements bring Australia's total humanitarian contribution since this conflict began to $52.5 million and is in addition to Australia's core funding of $20.6 million for UNRWA, which has already been provided for this financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The humanitarian crisis and the catastrophic consequences of regional escalation underlines why we are using our voice to advocate for parties to avoid the conflict spreading.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My engagements in the region underlined how heavily this conflict weighs on the peoples of this region. We mourn every Israeli and Palestinian innocent life which has been lost in this conflict and will continue to use our voice to support steps to peace in the region. Israelis and Palestinians want and deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Seeing the impacts of the conflict close up underscored to me the importance of remembering our common humanity, and how important it is that we safeguard peaceful dialogue in our community in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of2 6 February 2024 regarding petition EN5709, which requests changes to the Assessing Fitness to Drive standard (AFTD).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition expresses concerns about how the AFTD affects people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I would like to provide information about the AFTD in relation to the concerns raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary responsibility for driver licensing in Australia. The Australian Government works with these governments to bring a harmonised approach to driver licensing regimes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AFTD is a joint publication of Austroads and the National Transport Commission (NTC) that details the medical standards for driver licensing for use by health professionals and state and te1Titory driver licensing authorities. The publication is intended for use by any health professional who is involved in assessing a person's fitness to drive or providing information to support fitness to drive. The publication is also a primary source of requirements for driver licensing authorities in making determinations about medical fitness to hold a driver licence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The AFTD has been produced through an extensive consultation process involving medical, research and health experts, consumer groups, driver licensing authorities, and the transport industry. The NTC is responsible for developing the content ofthe guidelines and Austroads is responsible for publishing the guidelines and working with organisations who use them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Austroads recently published a statement to clarify how neurodevelopmental conditions such as ASD are intended to be managed according to the AFTD.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">They advise that the licensing criteria for a person with autism did not change in the 2022 edition of the AFTD, however additional guidance for health professionals on the management of neurodevelopmental disorders was included. This material was subject to expert review and public consultation during the development of the standards. The Austroads statement is available online at www.austroads.com.au/latest- news/assessing-fitness-to-drive-2022-no-changes-to-fitness-to-drive-requirements-for- people-diagnosed-with-autism.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Austroads notes the range and severity of ASD symptoms vary considerably and that people with an ASD diagnosis may not have symptoms impacting their ability to drive. As such, a diagnosis of ASD or another neurodevelopmental disorder does not compel a person to report their condition if their condition is not likely to affect their capacity to drive safely.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Austroads is accepting feedback on the AFTD through the page on the Austroads website listed above. The petitioners may wish to raise their concerns with Austroads directly via this process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 February 2024 regarding petition EN5756 concerning the conflict between Israel and Hamas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 February 2024 enclosing Petition EN5774, with 808 signatures, concerning the reduction of the maximum age from 50 to 35 years for the Temporary Graduate visa (TGV).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns raised regarding recent announcements by myself and the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP on the age limitation adjustment for the TGV program outlined in the Migration Strategy. The Migration Strategy repositions the TGV to support early career professionals develop the relevant work history they will need to progress to permanent residence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lowering the age eligibility for the TGV is part of broader structural reforms aimed to ensure that our most highly skilled international graduates drive long-term prosperity by transitioning to permanent visas as soon as possible. Key objectives of the Migration Strategy are to build stronger communities and reduce migrant worker exploitation by reducing the number of migrants who are permanently temporary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently TGV applicants are required to be under the age of 50 when they apply for their visa, while the age cut off for permanent resident applicants is 45, which leaves many older graduates permanently temporary. Reducing the maximum eligible age for a TGV to 35 will benefit applicants by repositioning the visa as a product for early career professionals who can contribute to the Australian economy over a longer period, while setting boundaries for others with low prospects of becoming permanent residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Department of Home Affairs data indicates over the past five years, 94 per cent of TGV applicants are aged 35 years or younger at the time of grant, with the average aged 25. Once implemented, the Department will not be able to consider TGV applications from international graduates who are over the age of 35; however, these graduates may have access to other migration pathways, which have been enhanced as a part of the visa reforms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International graduates who stay in Australia at the completion of their studies and pursue work opportunities help alleviate national skills shortages while making a valuable contribution to the Australian community. I want students to receive a high quality education in Australia, and to either choose to use their qualifications to join the global workforce or progress their career in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More specific details on implementation of TGV arrangements will be communicated ahead of a mid-2024 implementation. I encourage international students to continue to monitor the Department's website for updates.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of petition EN5832 concerning the clarity and consistency of advice on consular support to Australian citizens and permanent residents who have family members in Gaza. I know that this is an incredibly distressing time for Australians with extended family members in Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has now successfully assisted the vast majority of Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members wanting to leave Gaza to do so. As a result, the government is seeking to help more parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents to depart Gaza and is advocating for all parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents with relevant authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, not the Australian Government. They continue to put tight restrictions on who can cross. While we are doing all we can the Australian Government must work within this system, as do other countries with nationals in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in ongoing communication with Israeli and Egyptian authorities as well as likeminded countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, there are a number of people who have valid Australian visas but do not meet the criteria for crossing the border out of Gaza. An Australian visa is an entry document for use upon arrival into Australia, it is not an exit permit for the country where a holder resides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government will continue to do all it can to advocate for Australians, permanent residents and their immediate family members and parents who wish to leave Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity. Australia will be guided by the principle of advancing the cause of peace and progress toward a just and enduring two-state solution. I will continue to engage like-minded partners on how Australia can best contribute to achieving that goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 26 February 2024 regarding petition number EN5838 concerning Australian Government funding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency {UNRWA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government made a decision to pause disbursement of $6 million in funding to UNRWA after serious allegations were made, resulting in UNRWA's dismissal of staff alleged to have been involved in the Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October. The nature of the allegations warranted an immediate and appropriate response. The pause did not affect Australia's annual core funding of $20.6 million, which had already been provided for this financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has been working with a group of donor countries and with UNRWA on the shared objective of ensuring the integrity of UNRWA's operations, rebuilding confidence and ensuring aid flows to Gazans in desperate need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 16 March, I announced that Australia would lift this temporary pause following steps to strengthen the integrity of UNRWA operations. Australia and our partners welcome the decisive actions from UNRWA and the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to strengthen the integrity of operations. This includes the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services' investigation of the allegations, and the independent review into UNRWA and the principle of neutrality, led by former French Foreign Minister, Catherine Colonna.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We also welcome UNRWA's immediate work to deliver an action plan for donors, including Australia. The plan includes strengthened internal controls to ensure its neutrality, including rigorous requirements of staff. We see this as an ongoing process of diligence and vigilance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In disbursing the $6 million to UNRWA's flash appeal, Australia is finalising an updated funding agreement that will include stringent conditions such as guarantees of staff neutrality, and confidence in supply chains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These steps provide the necessary confidence that the $6 million in urgent humanitarian funding to be released will go directly to those in need, satisfying Australia's rigorous humanitarian controls, sanctions and legal requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's decision is in line with steps taken by Canada, Sweden and the EU. It is expected that more countries that have paused will take a similar approach.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">UNRWA must continue to do all it can to ensure the highest standards of governance and accountability are met, as its work is vital. There can be no tolerance for members of terrorist organisations working for UNRWA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Only UNRWA has the infrastructure to receive and distribute aid on the scale needed right now in Gaza. We urge Israel to recognise its mandate and work transparently to support its integrity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Successive Australian governments have funded the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, since 1951. After taking office, the Albanese Government doubled Australia's annual funding to UNRWA to $20 million each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In resuming funding, the Government is responding to a humanitarian situation in Gaza which is dire, and only worsening. Since the beginning of this conflict Australia has committed $52.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email referring petition number EN5846, regarding Australia's relationship with Syria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia recognises Syria as a nation state, but limits bilateral contact with the Syrian regime, and engages only when necessary. We stand resolutely against normalisation of relations with the Syrian regime, in line with other likeminded partners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia supports a peaceful resolution to the Syria conflict, and we continue to urge all parties to the conflict to engage meaningfully with the political process established by UN Security Council Resolution 2254.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition's request that the Australian Government suspend sanctions on Syria. Sanctions are targeted measures designed to respond to specific situations of international concern. Australia has implemented an autonomous sanctions framework in relation to Syria since 2011 to reflect our grave concern at the Syrian regime's deeply disturbing and unacceptable use of violence against its people. These do not impede our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note the petition's request to establish a Parliamentary Friends of Syria Group. Country Friendship Groups are coordinated by the International and Parliamentary Relations Office; enquiries should be directed to ipro@aph.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Refugee and Humanitarian Program: Gaza</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of petition EN5847 regarding a request to re-establish direct support to Palestinians evacuating from Gaza. I know that this is an incredibly distressing time for Australians with extended family members in Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has now successfully assisted the vast majority of Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members wanting to leave Gaza to do so. As a result, the government is seeking to help more parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents to depart Gaza and is advocating for all parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents with relevant authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, not the Australian Government. They continue to put tight restrictions on who can cross. While we are doing all we can the Australian Government must work within this system, as do other countries with nationals in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in ongoing communication with Israeli and Egyptian authorities as well as likeminded countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, there are a number of people who have valid Australian visas but do not meet the criteria for crossing the border out of Gaza. An Australian visa is an entry document for use upon arrival into Australia, it is not an exit permit for the country where a holder resides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will continue to do all we can to advocate for Australians, permanent residents and their immediate family members and parents who wish to leave Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity. Australia will be guided by the principle of advancing the cause of peace and progress toward a just and enduring two-state solution. I will continue to engage like-minded partners on how Australia can best contribute to achieving that goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to present this petition.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 26 February 2024, concerning petition number EN5849 relating to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Review (The Review).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns raised in this petition and thank those who participated for raising these with me and the Australian Government. This letter is my response to the petition, as required under standing order 209(a).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under current arrangements, regulation in the NDIS market has not been sufficiently proportionate to the risk of supports. This has led to gaps in regulatory oversight for some supports, as well as excessive burdens for lower-risk supports. As the NDIS market matures, the Government must ensure its regulatory settings continue to operate effectively and safeguard participants from unnecessary risks of harm, while also ensuring choice and control for participants over the way supports are delivered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Review outlined that further work will be required to design and implement this model, including consultation with people with disability, providers and other regulators, to determine how and where proportionality should be applied through a Provider Risk Framework. I appreciate that this reform would be a significant shift from the existing regulatory model, but it does not seek to limit choice and control which remains central to the NDIS. The Government understands that many participants have existing arrangements with providers and workers which they do not wish to change.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In January 2024, I established a Taskforce to commence this work.

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">National Disability Insurance Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 18 March 2024, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral (EN5855)—Access to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for people living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to confirm that all people with disability are able to access the NDIS if they meet the requirements set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 </span>(NDIS Act). Access to supports under the NDIS is not based on types of disability or on the presence of an underlying condition, illness or injury. People with ADHD can become NDIS participants if they meet the requirements set out in the NDIS Act, including providing evidence of the functional impact of their disability on activities of daily living. However, not all people with ADHD will meet the requirements in the NDIS Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly though, the Australian Government is committed to progressing real change for the 4.5 million people with disability in Australia, including people with ADHD, whether they are participants of the NDIS or not. As I made clear during my address to the National Press Club on 7 December 2023, the Government's focus is on creating a unified, connected system of support with support levels matched to need. This approach is about making sure all people living with disability in Australia have the best chance at life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your referral of this petition. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Susan</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 March 2024 in relation to Ministerial Petition EN5878.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to strengthening national and global pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and working with the Australian and international communities to be better prepared for the next pandemic. As referred to in this Ministerial Petition, one such reform under consideration through the World Health Organization (WHO) is the development of a new international instrument on pandemic preparedness, prevention and response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The intent of this new instrument is to strengthen the international community's efforts in preventing, preparing for and responding to future pandemics. It provides an opportunity to reduce the risk and impact of health threats, such as that posed by COVID-19, by strengthening global health systems and disease surveillance, while enhancing equity and future pandemic response. Australia is actively engaged in the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), which is drafting and negotiating proposed text for the new instrument. For further information about the work of the INB, please see https://apps.who.int/gb/inb.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this stage, none of the instrument provisions are agreed. Any new instrument that is negotiated will be subject to consideration by the Australian Parliament. This will include scrutiny by Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT), which reviews and reports to the Parliament on all treaty actions proposed by the Government. JSCOT undertakes consultation on proposed treaties by inviting public submissions. Any proposed changes to Australian law to implement the new instrument will have to be considered and passed by Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The WHO is, and remains, a Member State led organisation. Under international <span style="font-weight:bold;">law, </span>Member States such as Australia retain sovereignty regarding their public health policies and responses. The WHO has no legal authority to force countries to accept any of its recommendations and can only provide aid an.d assistance at Member States' request. These arrangements will not be changed should a new instrument on pandemic preparedness, prevention and response be agreed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 March 2024 regarding petition number EN5890 concerning the conflict between Israel and Hamas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email regarding Australian Government support for people seeking to leave Gaza. I know that this is an incredibly distressing time for Australians with extended family members in Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has now successfully assisted the vast majority of Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members wanting to leave Gaza to do so. As a result, the government is seeking to help more parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents to depart Gaza and is advocating for all parents of Australian citizens and permanent residents with relevant authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Egyptian and Israeli authorities, not the Australian Government. They continue to put tight restrictions on who can cross. While we are doing all we can the Australian Government must work within this system, as do other countries with nationals in Gaza. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is in ongoing communication with Israeli and Egyptian authorities as well as likeminded countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, there are a number of people who have valid Australian visas but do not meet the criteria for crossing the border out of Gaza. An Australian visa is an entry document for use upon arrival into Australia, it is not an exit permit for the country where a holder resides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We will continue to do all we can to advocate for Australians, permanent residents and their immediate family members and parents who wish to leave Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity. Australia will be guided by the principle of advancing the cause of peace and progress toward a just and enduring two-state solution. I will continue to engage like-minded partners on how Australia can best contribute to achieving that goal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you very much for your correspondence on this important matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 March 2024 regarding petition number EN5899 concerning funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know the conflict in the Middle East is deeply distressing for many Australians, particularly those with a connection to the region and loved ones directly impacted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear from the Government's engagements Australia has a respected voice in the Middle East, even if we are not a central player. I regularly raise Australia's view and press for progress towards peace in my engagements with counterparts in the Middle East, with partners including in Europe, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our region, as well as in multilateral forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using Australia's voice to advocate for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and a pathway out of this conflict. As demonstrated by our vote at the United Nations, Australia is part of the international diplomatic effort urging an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. We see that as a critical, urgent step on the path to a permanent ceasefire. Like any ceasefire, this can't be one-sided. Hamas must cease its attacks, lay down its arms and release all hostages immediately.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In my visit to the region earlier this year, I made clear Australia's view that achieving peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians requires a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state. The status quo is failing everyone.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express Australia's serious concern about the civilian death toll and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have consistently emphasised that international law must be upheld—and that civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages by Hamas, and to condemn the October 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas. I have expressed our concern for hostages directly to families when I met with them in Australia and in Israel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are using our voice to express our grave concern at indications Israel is planning a ground offensive into Rafah. About 1.7 million Palestinians are taking refuge in the area. With the humanitarian situation in Gaza already dire, the impacts on Palestinian civilians from a major military operation would be catastrophic. Our message to Israel is: do not go down this path.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I was in the West Bank, I met with Palestinian victims of violence by Israeli settlers. I made clear to my counterparts that this violence must cease and perpetrators must be held accountable. We consistently affirm that settlements are illegal under international law and a major impediment to peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is using our voice to advocate for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate need, and to address the protracted refugee crisis in the region. While in Jordan, I announced an additional $21.5 million in humanitarian assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In March, we announced that Australia will also support efforts by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster will deliver a supply of 140 Australian Defence Force aerial delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is also providing an additional $4 million to UNICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children, and $2 million to the new mechanism of the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These announcements bring Australia's total humanitarian contribution since this conflict began to $52.5 million and is in addition to Australia's core funding of $20.6 million for UNRWA, which has already been provided for this financial year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The humanitarian crisis and the catastrophic consequences of regional escalation underlines why we are using our voice to advocate for parties to avoid the conflict spreading.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is lifting its temporary pause on funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) following steps to strengthen the integrity of UNRWA operations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to pause an additional $6 million in funding was taken after serious allegations were made, resulting in UNRWA's dismissal of staff alleged to have been involved in the Hamas terrorist attacks of 7 October.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The nature of the allegations warranted an immediate and appropriate response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has been working with a group of donor countries and with UNRWA on the shared objective of ensuring the integrity of UNRWA's operations, rebuilding confidence and ensuring aid flows to Gazans in desperate need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and our partners welcome the decisive actions from UNRWA and the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to strengthen the integrity of operations. This includes the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services' investigation of the allegations, and the independent review into UNRWA and the principle of neutrality, led by former French Foreign Minister, Catherine Colonna.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We welcome UNRWA's immediate work to deliver an action plan for donors, including Australia. The plan includes strengthened internal controls to ensure its neutrality, including rigorous requirements of staff.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We see this as an ongoing process of diligence and vigilance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In disbursing the $6 million to UNRWA's flash appeal, Australia is finalising an updated funding agreement that will include stringent conditions such as guarantees of staff neutrality, and confidence in supply chains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These steps provide the necessary confidence that the $6 million in urgent humanitarian funding to be released will go directly to those in need, satisfying Australia's rigorous humanitarian controls, sanctions and legal requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's decision is in line with steps taken by Canada, Sweden and the EU. It is expected that more countries that have paused will take a similar approach.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">UNRWA must continue to do all it can to ensure the highest standards of governance and accountability are met, as its work is vital. There can be no tolerance for members of terrorist organisations working for UNRWA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Only UNRWA has the infrastructure to receive and distribute aid on the scale needed right now in Gaza. We urge Israel to recognise its mandate and work transparently to support its integrity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Successive Australian governments have funded the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, since 1951. After taking office, the Albanese Government doubled Australia's annual funding to UNRWA to $20 million each year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In resuming funding, the Government is responding to a humanitarian situation in Gaza which is dire, and only worsening.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My engagements in the region underlined how heavily this conflict weighs on the peoples of this region. We mourn every Israeli and Palestinian innocent life which has been lost in this conflict and will continue to use our voice to support steps to peace in the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Israelis and Palestinians want and deserve to live their lives in peace, security and dignity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Seeing the impacts of the conflict close up underscored to me the importance of remembering our common humanity, and how important it is that we safeguard peaceful dialogue in our community in Australia.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Child Support Scheme</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 18 March 2024 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning petition number EN5915, which relates to the Child Support Scheme. The Minister has asked me to respond to you on her behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All forms of family and domestic violence are unacceptable. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring single parents and their children receive the financial support they are entitled to, and that government systems don't exacerbate any abuse, including financial abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns raised in the petition about the interaction between care arrangements and the child support formula. Child support assessments are generally calculated on the actual care of the children, as this helps to ensure they are financially supported, regardless of with whom they reside.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that while the Government encourages involvement of both parents in their children's lives, the Child Support Scheme does not play any role in establishing or enforcing care arrangements for children. Disputes around parenting matters are best dealt with through mediation or dispute resolution or pursued through the family law system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General, the Hon Mark Dreyfus KC MP is responsible for leading the Government's commitment to improving the family law system so that it is accessible, safer, simpler to use, and delivers justice and fairness for all Australian families. In particular, that the best interests of children are prioritised and placed at the centre of the family law system. This commitment is reflected in the recent passage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Amendment Act 2023 </span>which amended the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family Law Act 1975 </span>to implement a streamlined parenting framework and simplify compliance and enforcement provisions for child-related orders.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under child support legislation, where there is a care dispute between parents, an interim period may sometimes be available to recognise the court ordered care, but under current legislation an interim period can only apply at the start of a new child support assessment, where the breach of the care arrangement occurs at that point. This was confirmed by the Federal Court of Australia in February 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is taking action to address the uncertainty associated with interim care arrangements. The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support and Family Assistance Technical Amendments) Bill 2024, which recently passed the Parliament, will enable an interim period to apply for disputed care changes that occur on or after the date the Bill commences. These provisions will commence after the Bill receives Royal Assent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition requests a review of the child support legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the 2023-24 Budget, the Government committed $5.1 million to implement key child support recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System (the Committee).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Government's response to the Committee's recommendations, the Government agreed to a range of recommendations to improve the Child Support Scheme over the longer term. The Government will be undertaking a number of reviews of the Child Support Scheme, including a review of compliance, private collection arrangements, and the interaction between Child Support and Family Tax Benefit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also commission new research into the costs facing separated parents and has established a Child Support Expert Panel to ensure the child support formula reflects the current costs of raising children in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister appreciates you bringing this matter to her attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Environmental Management: Dingoes</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 March 2024 concerning the petition to place moratoriums on lethal dingo control and possession of 1080.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the concerns about the use of 1080 in Australia. Protecting Australian's health and our environment, including unintended impacts on pets and other wildlife, is the Australian Government's priority in regulating agricultural and veterinary (agvet) chemicals such as 1080. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) rigorously assesses vertebrate poisons, such as 1080, before they are approved for use to ensure the safety of humans, animals and the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns about the impact of 1080 on non-target animals, such as pets and dingoes. The APVMA 2008 review found that, while poisoning of non-target animals can occur, when appropriate attention is paid to 1080 bait density, placement, timing, substrate and other matters, impacts can be minimised. Although alternatives do exist, they may not be suitable in all circumstances. Having a range of pest management tools ensures appropriate measures are available to respond to specific needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will bring the potential for human health impact through the cultural practices and diets of our First Nation Peoples to the attention of the APVMA as a factor for their future prioritisation of chemical reconsideration activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, agvet chemicals are managed under a cooperative regulatory scheme between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments, with a shared division of responsibilities. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth is responsible for regulating agvet chemicals up to the point of supply, while the states and territories are responsible for controlling the use of chemicals after supply (commonly called control of use).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The potential misuse of agvet chemicals falls within the responsibility of the state and territory governments. I would encourage anyone to report specific instances of suspected non- compliance in the use of products such as 1080, such as the deliberate targeting of dingoes or other protected species, to the appropriate state or territory government agency, these details can be found at this website address: apvma.gov.au/node/3190.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing your concerns to my attention.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 31 March 2022 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, enclosing Petition EN3877, with five signatures, seeking the provision of permanent residency to international students who studied onshore during the COVID-19 pandemic. I apologise for the delay in responding. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">International students are an invaluable part of Australian communities, bringing new ideas and skills to enrich the fabric of our society, and a diversity of perspectives and experiences that are highly valued in our classrooms, and in the community. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The primary purpose of the student visa program is to facilitate the arrival of international students to live and study in Australia temporarily, in order to obtain a high quality education, and to either choose to use their qualifications to join the global workforce or apply the skills we need to a career in Australia. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that on 11 December 2023 the government released the Migration Strategy, which was developed to deliver a better managed and more targeted migration system. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the Migration Strategy, the Government is recalibrating student and graduate visa settings to support both the education sector and Australia's migration needs, and create clearer pathways for student visa holders. These changes will help students to have a positive educational experience in Australia and support students with the skills Australia needs to transition to the workforce and help drive economic productivity. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following their studies, student visa holders may seek to apply for a further stay in Australia, either temporarily or permanently, subject to meeting eligibility criteria. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The temporary graduate (subclass 485) visa provides recently graduated international students the opportunity to live and work in Australia following completion of their studies. This visa allows recently graduated students to gain temporary access to the Australian Labour market, and obtain practical work experience to accompany their qualification.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The skilled visa program also recognises the value of an Australian education. International students who have completed a bachelor's degree or higher, a diploma, an advanced diploma, or a trade qualification undertaken at an Australian educational institution are awarded additional points towards meeting the criteria for certain permanent skilled visas.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN5021 presented to the House of Representatives on 22 May 2023, regarding changes to the solar feed-in rate. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention and apologise for the delayed response. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The unprecedented wave of investment in rooftop solar over recent years has enabled more than one in three Australian households to access the benefits of rooftop solar, the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world. The main benefit of installing rooftop solar is using what consumers generate during that day in their homes and avoiding the cost of purchasing electricity at the retail price. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The retail electricity tariff customers receive and the solar tariff consumers receive for exporting solar differs due to a range of reasons. The electricity tariff retailers charge consumers is made up of a broader range of costs: the wholesale price (the costs of generating electricity); network costs (the cost to maintain and operate the poles and wires that deliver energy to and from their home); environmental costs and retailer costs. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each state and territory has different solar feed-in tariff rates and rules relating to solar tariffs. In jurisdictions where retail competition exists, retailers set solar feed-in tariffs to reflect a range of factors including their underlying cost base, their customers solar panel take-up rate and competitive considerations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the best ways consumers can save money on energy prices is by shopping around for a better deal. There is a range of offers in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland which customers can compare at www.energymadeeasy.gov.au. Consumers living in Victoria can compare offers at www.compare.energy.vic.gov.au. Both websites are free to use and will provide consumers with information on offers available in the market, making it easier for them to find the best deal. It is important to note the deal with the best feed-in-tariff may not be the best deal for customers overall. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, in November 2023 Energy and Climate Change Ministers agreed to develop a National Consumer Energy Resources (CER) Roadmap—Powering Decarbonised Homes and Communities, to unlock consumer benefits for locally generated and stored power, deliver national reforms for efficient and effective CER integration, deliver on emissions and renewable energy commitments, and drive positive outcomes for all consumers, regardless of income, and the system as a whole.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 16 October 2023 to the Hon Mark Dreyfus KC MP, Attorney-General, regarding a petition to request the House of Representatives to consider supporting a program to educate the public on the structure and function of Executive Government (reference EN5409).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Your email was referred to me for a response. Civics education and awareness is an essential part of the democratic process and supports public participation in our society and democracy. I understand this petition was brought about so that the public could understand what is meant by the 'Executive Government' in the context of the Referendum to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice which may make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government. Ahead of the 2023 referendum to recognise the First Peoples of Australia in the Constitution through a Voice, the Government took steps to ensure all Australians were provided with the necessary information to make an informed choice, including through delivery of a civics education program. The referendum did not pass, and the Government respects the decision of the Australian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, I am pleased to refer to existing public educational materials of various lengths and detail on the subject of the Executive Government. The Parliament of Australia website contains a range of publicly available materials and factsheets. 'Infosheet 20—The Australian system of government' contains a section on the Executive Government (https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government). Furthermore, Chapter 2 of the 2018 seventh edition of the House of Representatives Practice contains a detailed subsection called 'The Constitution and Executive Government' (https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Parliamentary Education Office webpage titled the 'Separation of powers: Parliament, Executive and Judiciary' is a short webpage on the principle of the separation of powers and is targeted at a younger audience (https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/how-parliament-works/system-of-government/separation-of-powers-parliament-executive-and-judiciary).</span>

This includes introducing economy-wide measures; measures to address scams, harmful apps, fake reviews and dispute resolution pathways on digital platforms; and a new digital competition regime. In its review, the ACCC identified issues such as security, privacy and billing concerns on apps and user accounts.</span>

The Government tasked Treasury and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to improve the dispute resolution processes available to users of digital platforms; and for Treasury to consult on the design of a potential new digital competition regime. Government will consider the outcomes of these processes and take a harms-based approach to prioritising and addressing issues in digital platform markets.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5599. The Government welcomes the public's views and appreciates the consideration that has been given to this matter.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In today's evolving banking landscape, there has been a noticeable shift towards telephone, online, and mobile app banking. These changes have resulted in a decrease in over-the-counter transactions, with more people turning to online banking options. This shift reflects changing consumer preferences and the influence of new technologies, but it has also led to banks reducing their branch networks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is concerned about the impact these changes have on communities in need of face-to-face banking services, as well as small businesses that rely on access to deposit and withdraw cash.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 June 2023, the Government released its the 'Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System', which details the policy priorities and objectives of the Government in relation to payments. One of the initiatives in the plan was 'Maintaining adequate access to cash'. As part of this, the Government will work with relevant agencies across the public sector and with industry to ensure that Australia has a sustainable cash distribution network that maintains adequate access to cash.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Government understands that some Australians still rely on cheques as a form of payment and the intention to wind down the cheques system by the end of2030 may impact individual's ability to. make payments for everyday transactions. In announcing an end-date for the cheques system, the Government is taking a leading role in ensuring this transition is managed in an orderly manner that limits adverse impacts on the community.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the transition, on 8 December 2023, the Government released a consultation paper on the winding down of the cheques system to understand the opportunities and challenges it needs to prepare for in transitioning away from the cheques system. The paper explores current uses of cheques and options for transitioning to alternative payment methods.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 February 2024 regarding support for a national skin check program. I recognise the contribution of Skin Check Champions and commend their work improving the early detection of skin cancer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government does not fund a national skin cancer screening program, Australians can receive a skin check as part of a consultation with their general practitioner or specialist, which is supported through a range of Medicare Benefits Schedule Items.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's screening policy is informed by the Population-based Screening Framework (Framework), which provides guidance for decision makers on issues to consider when introducing screening programs. While there is insufficient evidence to support a population-wide screening program for skin cancer in line with the Framework, evidence is emerging on the value of a targeted skin cancer screening program. However, more research is needed to test critical aspects of such a program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue considering the evidence for skin cancer screening, including alternative approaches to skin cancer detection and the role of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be interested to know that I will soon host a roundtable with the sector to discuss skin cancer across the cancer continuum, in line with implementation of the Australian Cancer Plan. Planning is underway, and details will be confirmed shortly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and Sri Lanka share a strong and enduring relationship based on our aspirations for a peaceful, stable and prosperous lndo-Pacific. The Australian Government responded swiftly to Sri Lanka's unprecedented economic crisis in 2022 by providing $75 million to support the country's economic recovery. Through our development program, Australia is supporting the Sri Lankan government, non-profit institutions, and civil society to improve evidence-based policy and decision-making, deliver better services for communities, and increase the voice and agency of marginalised groups, including women.</span>

This includes regularly raising human rights issues with Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council, through our High Commission in Colombo, and with the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government considers a humane approach to irregular migration is required, it must also ensure that new people smuggling ventures do not reach our shores. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining strong border protection measures, including regional processing and boat turn backs where it is safe to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is upholding the policy setting that individuals who attempt to travel to Australia irregularly by boat, including transitory persons, will not settle in Australia. These policy settings have successfully stemmed the flow of irregular maritime ventures to Australia, disrupted people smuggling operations in the region and prevented loss of life at sea.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government of Nauru (GoN) is responsible for the implementation of regional processing arrangements in Nauru, including the management of individuals under those arrangements. Australia supports Nauru to implement arrangements through the provision of contracted service providers. Individuals in Nauru have access to health and welfare services and are provided support to engage with durable migration options.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is party to the various international human rights treaties, including 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Australia takes its international obligations seriously and is committed to upholding them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since regional processing re-commenced in 2012, the Australian Parliament has undertaken several reviews of regional processing arrangements and circumstances arising from these arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Independent organisations, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have conducted monitoring visits in Nauru. Transitory persons are free to communicate any concerns they may have. The Australian Government continues to support the monitoring role of non-government organisations. Noting that monitoring visits to Nauru require the permission of the GoN, responses to issues raised following such visits are matters for the GoN. The Australian Government will support the GoN to address any concerns.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee (the Committee) scrutinises regional processing arrangements via Senate Estimates hearings a minimum of three times a year (in May, October and February). The Committee examines past and planned spending during public hearings, which are attended by officials from the Portfolio.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 to the Hon Chris Bowen MP, Minister for Climate Change and Energy, regarding Petition EN5647, which requests the House of Representatives to enact legislation for the adoption of European-equivalent emissions standards for all vehicles sold in Australia. Your email was referred to me, as this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia currently mandates Euro 5 noxious emission standards for new light vehicles. During previous consultations held over the last decade, key stakeholders advised that improvements to fuel quality standards must commence before Euro 6 can be mandated for light vehicles in Australia. This is because the higher levels of sulfur and aromatics currently permitted in petrol sold in Australia can affect the operability of Euro 6 vehicles, which are engineered to operate on cleaner fuels.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 21 December 2023, the Australian Government announced it would mandate Euro 6 noxious emission standards for new light vehicle models, in conjunction with improved fuel quality standards from December 2025. New units of existing models supplied from</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">July 2028 will also need to comply. This timeline strikes a balance between maximising health and environmental benefits and ensuring manufacturers and refineries have sufficient time to implement the required changes, without disrupting the supply of fuel and new cars to Australian motorists. Equivalent standards have already been implemented for new trucks and buses supplied from 1 November 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 4 February 2024, Minister Bowen and I announced the Government's preferred model for the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (the Standard), and released the Cleaner, Cheaper to Run Cars: The Australian New vehicle Efficiency Standard Consultation Impact Analysis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's preferred model would provide around $143 billion in net benefits for Australians by 2050, including around $108 billion in fuel cost savings and $5 billion in health benefits. Without intervention, transport is projected to be Australia's largest source of emissions by 2030 and the Government's preferred model for the Standard is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by around 370 million tonnes by 2050.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Designing the best possible Standard to suit Australia's circumstances is complex, and we are committed to getting it right. Foundational work to introduce the Standard has included a substantial program of indust1y and public consultation, detailed economic modelling and consideration of the unique standards designed for other jurisdictions like New Zealand, the European Union and the United States. New legislation to support the introduction of the Standard will be introduced in Parliament in due course.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 February 2024 to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Mark Butler MP, concerning petition number EN5699 regarding Medicare funding of GP Referred Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is focused on delivering its priorities for the health and wellbeing of all Australians. Key among these priorities is strengthening Medicare to make it easier for Australians to see a doctor, cutting the cost of healthcare, and ensuring all Australians are treated with the respect they deserve and receive quality services to support them as they age.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises MRI scans are an important diagnostic tool for medical practitioners in diagnosing, managing and treating illness. In 2022-23, the Government supported patient access to MRI scans through Medicare at a total cost of $545 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 November 2022, the limitations on where an MRI machine could operate were removed in regional, rural and remote {Modified Monash Model 2 to 7) areas. This means MRI machines located in these areas are Medicare eligible when they satisfy the MRI requirements to deliver Medicare-eligible MRI services. This has significantly increased the number of Medicare eligible MRI machines available. Locations of Medicare-eligible MRI machines around Australia is available from the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au using the search term 'MRI locations'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of specific concerns about GP requests for MRI services, there are instances where services, including diagnostic imaging services, listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), may have restrictions. These are based on clinical considerations such as gender, age, frequency of services, and requester requirements.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Most MRI scans on the MBS must be requested by a specialist doctor. This is because the specialist is usually managing the conditions for which MRI scans can help with clinical decisions with the patient. There are however a limited number of MRI scans available on the MBS that may be requested by a· GP.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The MRI scans that can be requested by a GP were developed in consultation with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists. The scans available were based on the appropriate scope of practice for GPs and based on clinical guidelines for the managing of patients. The RACGP has issued clinical guidance for MRI requesting which is available on the RACGP website at www.racgp.gov.au by using the search term 'MRI'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Aged Care Act 1997 </span>requires aged care providers to provide safe and quality aged care at all times, in accordance with the Aged Care Quality Standards (Standards). The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Commission) regulates the sector using these Standards (among other legal provisions) to fulfil its role to protect and improve the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of life of people receiving Australian Government funded aged care.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am advised that the Commission undertook a comprehensive unannounced reaccreditation site audit at the service from 26 to 28 September 2023 to assess the service's performance against all 42 requirements of the Standards. Following the audit, the Commission found the service compliant with the Standards. A performance assessment report detailing the Commission's findings from the audit can be found on its website at www.agedcareguality.gov.au/service-and-reports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The service is currently accredited until 14 March 2027. Throughout an accreditation period, the Commission will continue to monitor a service using the full range of information available to it. If the Commission identifies risks to the health, safety and/or wellbeing of residents at a service, it will take appropriate action to ensure that they are safe. More information about how the Commission assesses and monitors aged care services is available on its website at www.agedcarequality.gov.au/providers/assessment-monitoring.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's third report for 2024. This report considers a proposal referred in November last year from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation for its nuclear medicine facility project. The total cost of the proposed ANSTO project is $619.23 million. Since the late 1970s, ANSTO has produced a variety of nuclear medicines, supported scientific nuclear research and advised the government on matters relating to nuclear medicine. ANSTO produces nuclear medicines for diagnosis and treatment of many illnesses and currently supplies 75 to 80 per cent of all nuclear medicine used in Australia. This is between 10,000 and 12,000 procedures each week—time-bound, time-sensitive material shipped all around Australia overnight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average, every Australian is likely to benefit from nuclear medicine and will require at least two doses or two procedures during their lifetime. This project will secure Australia's access to a long-term study of vital nuclear medicines by replacing an existing, nearly half-century-old manufacturing facility at the Lucas Heights campus, which has reached the end of its useful life. The replacement facility will be a two-storey building with a site footprint of approximately 6½ thousand square metres. The new facility will be able to produce the nuclear medicines—technetium, lutetium and iodine—at a greater capacity than the existing facility, ensuring an Australian supply of nuclear medicine, even in the event of increasing demand. The facility will also support the export of nuclear medicine to our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment in the nuclear medicine sector has a range of economic benefits for the Australian public, especially given projected shortages in imaging and medicine capability worldwide. Socioeconomic benefits will flow to industry, healthcare professionals, the nuclear medicine research sector and, obviously, patients. Australia's ability to manufacture nuclear medicine products for domestic use is dependent on ANSTO's facilities at Lucas Heights. It is clear these treatments are continually evolving as new medical technologies develop. The new facility will continue to provide research facilities into emerging nuclear medicine technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes the ongoing question of nuclear waste and reiterates the importance of Australia obtaining a purpose-built facility for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would like to extend its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of this inquiry. The committee—members of which I'm surrounded by at the moment—would also like to thank personnel from ANSTO for the tour, provided to the committee, of the Lucas Heights campus. It was very impressive. The committee was struck by the passion and commitment that staff have for their important roles, knowing that they are often involved in life or death situation for patients at the end of the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that it is expedient the proposed work be carried out. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  We in this House all know that we are living in a changing world, and with that change have come security challenges. We know that authoritarian powers are on the move, and the last two ASIO directors-general, Duncan Lewis and Mike Burgess, have both said that espionage and foreign interference are occurring in Australia at unprecedented levels. I think that last night ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>, which documented the intelligence activities undertaken by China's Ministry of Public Security, underscored that very point. So it's important that we make sure our legislative framework for our intelligence agencies is fit for purpose. We've got to make sure that our intelligence agencies, our intelligence officers and supporting personnel can do their jobs, on behalf of Australia, to protect us, maintain our security and defend our interests. That means we have to adapt our framework to make sure that it's fit for purpose as we see shifts in threats, technology and modes of statecraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Richardson review was commissioned in 2018, the same year that the former Turnbull government passed landmark, historic espionage and foreign interference legislation. The Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the National Intelligence Community, also known as the Richardson review, was the most significant review of Australia's intelligence legislation since the Hope royal commissions in 1974 and in 1983. The majority of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023 deals with the 12 recommendations of the Richardson review, all of which the former coalition government agreed to in 2020, so we support this on a bipartisan basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes additional elements that the current government has identified in consultation with national security agencies. The bill contains a number of provisions to amend the ASIO Act, the Intelligence Services Act, the TIA Act and the Archives Act to support and provide increased oversight of our intelligence agencies. These reforms address those 12 recommendations. Separate to the recommendations, the bill clarifies the operation of existing provisions in the ASIO Act and the Intelligence Services Act and updates the publication offence in the ASIO Act. Very generally—for the Australian public—the measures in this bill will support Australia's national security agencies by strengthening identity protections for employees, particularly against the backdrop of increased espionage and foreign interference in this country; increasing operational flexibility and sharing of information; clarifying some authorities to provide greater certainty for our intelligence agencies; and supporting quicker processing of security clearance suitability assessments. This is actually really important. Our whole national security enterprise, from Defence through to the national intelligence community, is undergoing greater recruitment efforts, and, as people are onboarded into Defence or our intelligence community, they need to have security clearance. So speeding that process up is vital for our national security, particularly when you add in AUKUS and the need for defence industry, which supports AUKUS, to have people who have the highest clearances. This bill will also promote increased oversight of national security agencies by introducing additional safeguards to provide oversight of ASIO's work on security assessments and vetting and by limiting who can exercise certain powers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House, the coalition, will always support sensible changes to ensure that Australian men and women serving in our intelligence agencies can do their jobs effectively—that they can gather the intelligence, on behalf of us, to keep us safe. That's why they do what they do. We need to ensure that they are subject to appropriate oversight, and that's why we support these amendments. As such, we support the passage of the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  The previous speaker, the member for Canning, is also a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I thank him and other colleagues for their work on that committee. We did a fair bit of work on this bill when it was referred to the committee, as part of our work in making recommendations to government to always try and improve national security legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say at the outset that this government's primary commitment is to keeping Australians safe and protecting Australians' way of life, and this legislation is part of that effort. It's part of the effort to ensure that we have all the necessary resources and frameworks in place for our intelligence agencies. Of course, many of the elements of this legislation, the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023, flow from the intelligence comprehensive review. The key part of this bill is the enhancement of transparency, and the frameworks for transparency around our intelligence agencies and the work that they do, in what we call the NSLAB. We've done a lot of work in this space to ensure that our intelligence and security agencies have the tools and resources they need to do their job efficiently and effectively. That's been part of the work of the PJCIS in reviewing the bill. We've worked towards finding a bipartisan consensus within the committee to ensure that the bill is passed in the best possible way, which is in the national interest and will get the best possible result for our intelligence agencies. It is about a continual improvement of our national security laws to ensure that our agencies are well equipped to continue their work to keep Australians safe and, as I said, protect our way of life. The introduction of this bill is very much part of that framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the PJCIS released its report in relation to this bill, the NSLAB. As you have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill covers 12 recommendations of the 2019 Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the National Intelligence Community. This is actually the third in a series of bills that directly respond to the recommendations of that comprehensive review. As I said, its primary purpose is to ensure our intelligence agencies remain able to undertake their important functions efficiently, effectively and, of course, with the appropriate oversight. In many respects this bill consolidates the secrecy offences in the Intelligence Services Act and creates stronger protection of the identities of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO. That is a central element of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to emphasise today are the amendments this act creates in relation to part IV of the ASIO Act, which relates to the agency's security assessment functions. These include improvements in the transparency and accountability of our intelligence agencies, a core objective of this bill. The comprehensive review that was released publicly in 2020 was the most significant independent review of Australia's collective intelligence legislation since the Hope royal commissions in 1974 and in 1983. That comprehensive review found that the legislative framework governing our intelligence agencies has been well maintained and largely fit for purpose but that targeted reforms are required to ensure our laws continue to keep pace with the ever-changing technological and security landscape. That has clearly been accelerated, particularly over the last decade and certainly over the last couple of years. The technological advances, the changes and the impacts and implications they have on our intelligence agencies and the work they do are profound, so it's critically important that we deliver these targeted reforms to keep pace with that increasingly complex environment—best described as our symmetric security landscape. That is critical to this bill because of the use of more and more complex technology in various attacks—cyberattacks, cybertargeting and throughout the cybersecurity space—but also more broadly in the way that adversaries tend to use technology in much more sophisticated ways to diminish our democratic institutions and our governance structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill continues that government reform agenda in response to the comprehensive review, with a very clear line of sight on these challenges. The Albanese Labor government take these reforms extremely seriously and we are intent on implementing them as efficiently as possible. So far, we as a government have enacted a series of targeted amendments to our national security laws to implement the recommendations of the comprehensive review. These include the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 1) Act 2022, which implemented 12 recommendations, the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 2) Act 2023, which implemented a further 10 recommendations, and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Modernisation) Act 2023, which implemented two recommendations. With this bill, we will be implementing another 12 outstanding recommendations of the comprehensive review. The bill supports Australia's national security agencies through the implementing of those recommendations with a couple of important elements: strengthening identity protections for those security agencies' employees; improving operational flexibility and the ability of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to communicate information; providing greater certainty as to who can provide authorisations for various activities; and supporting quicker processing of security clearance suitability assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National security legislation inevitably—and, in most cases, importantly—grants security agencies very critical functions that can be quite powerful as they're wielded in the day-to-day operations and investigations that these agencies undertake. That is why it's so important that we are enhancing the transparency and accountability of ASIO's security assessments, because we believe that more checks and balances are actually a good thing. That transparency in the work of our agencies, and those checks and balances, are important elements in our responsibility as a government to ensure that the powers that are being used by those agencies are used in the best possible way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government are broadening the definition of a prescribed administrative action to include decisions relating to parole, firearms licences and security guard licences. That means any advice provided to a state or Commonwealth body relating to parole, firearms licences and security licences in relation to an individual will now be regarded as a formal security assessment made by ASIO. This, in turn, means that individuals now have expanded rights of review and notification in relation to any advice ASIO gives in relation to the topics I just mentioned. This can sound quite complex, but I want to make this point: the reform just shows and demonstrates how committed the Albanese Labor government is to taking a transparent, accountability based approach to our security arrangements. This is an approach which balances every individual's right of review and transparency with the collective security needs of Australians and of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We always take a consultative approach when doing this work. I noted earlier the good work of my colleagues on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. When we were looking at it as a committee, we engaged in a consultative and consensus based way to seek to find answers and recommendations on the bill that could lead us to the best possible result for the national interest and for our national security. We did this in relation to many of the submissions to the PJCIS recommending making and supporting these changes in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also implementing new reporting requirements for ASIO in relation to any security assessments that the agency makes which are overly delayed. Currently, individuals undergoing security assessments by ASIO have no recourse other than complaining to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS, if there's an unreasonable delay in receiving their assessment. Our amendments will now require ASIO to notify the IGIS if there is a delay of more than 12 months in finalising a security assessment. A written protocol will be established to specify when ASIO is considered to have started preparing an assessment, the time frame for notifying delayed assessments and the information to be included in notifications. The protocol will also outline steps for ASIO to take after notifying the IGIS about delays. Again, we as a government are proud of the work in furthering the accountability of our highly competent but powerful agencies and making sure that they can do their work most efficiently and effectively. Each of the agencies that would be impacted by these changes supports this change, emphasising the importance of notifying the IGIS about these delays.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this legislation, we're also giving ASIO increased powers to introduce new classifications of prescribed administrative action. We know that the security landscape is fast-moving and complex. We know it's moving at such a clip that it's often hard for regulatory and legislative frameworks to keep up the pace. We think that these changes will allow ASIO to become more agile in the way it conducts its security assessments. At the same time, the regulations would grant greater transparency and rights of review to those individuals affected by the assessments. We're trying to get that balance right. Given our robust parliamentary processes via many different parliamentary committees in the House and the Senate, and joint committees like the PJCIS, we think these powers of regulation balance the interests of ASIO to be an agile and strong security agency able to undertake the very important and critical work it does with giving this place, the parliament, sufficient checks and balances over its activities, all while enhancing the agency's accountability and making its processes more transparent for any of its decisions which affect individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Security threats are becoming more and more asymmetric, as I noted earlier. They're becoming more and more complex. They're becoming more and more difficult to combat and to defend against. Last year alone, a cybersecurity incident was reported every six minutes. That's a remarkable statistic. Hostile cyberactivities are driving disinformation, which has destabilising effects on our social cohesion. This is not just at the Commonwealth level but at the state level, where such threats affect state infrastructure and social services. This includes cyberthreats to hospitals that are operated by states. Our healthcare system, our education system, our academia, our democratic institutions and our corporations and their systems and are all subject to significant targeting, cyberthreats and cyberattacks. Attempts to enhance that cybersecurity are critically important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just one part of a much bigger piece of legislative work necessary to ensure that we give the tools and the resources particularly to our agencies to ensure that we can defend against these threats that are emanating not just from state actors but also from criminal syndicates and non-state actors. These cyberattacks no longer just compromise military capabilities; they have real whole-of-government and whole-of-population effects—implications for the entire population—so it's essential that state governments are also able to act based on urgent advice provided by ASIO, which is what this act does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing to provide all the tools our agencies need to get on with the job. ASIO will now be able to make preliminary communications to state governments or other state based agencies. State based agencies can now act on security advice that is not necessarily a formal security assessment if the agency is satisfied that the action is necessary for security reasons, and that's a significant step. We need to break down those barriers between our different levels of government. We are all seeking to protect our democracy and our democratic institutions, whether they be at the state, local or federal level of government. That requires a much more agile approach, which I'm pleased to say is part of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the work we do in the PJCIS—and I note that my deputy chair is here—is critically important. We take it very seriously, because we have a critical and I think sacrosanct obligation to the people we represent across this great country to protect their way of life, to protect our way of life, to protect the democratic institutions, to protect our democracy and to defend against those who would seek to sow discord and division and disrupt those institutions and our society. In the work that we do we don't always agree, but that's part of the democratic process, and I know from all my colleagues on the committee that we always strive to reach consensus on what we think is the best possible result for the national interest and the national security of Australia. That is where, in good faith, everyone steps into those PJCIS meetings and the work that we do. I want to thank the deputy chair and my colleagues on the other side for their contributions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will reiterate that the changes that were made in this bill based on the advice provided to us by the comprehensive review are quite an important part of that process. Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for being able to articulate the important work that we've undertaken.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I thank the chair of the PJCIS for his warm and generous remarks about the bipartisan nature we try to strive for on the PJCIS, because he's right. On this I agree with him—that we really do try to leave our political guns at the door when we walk into those meeting rooms, because there is no greater responsibility that anybody has in this place, whether in opposition or in government, than to protect the Australian people and our homeland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the privilege of being the deputy chair of the PJCIS for two years, and in that time we've undertaken 22 inquiries. I believe we still have nine inquiries underway, although that seems a somewhat small list compared with what we've had in recent times. I chaired many committees when we were in government, and by far this committee has the highest-tempo work rate of any committee I have worked on. That is an indication of the nature of the fast pace at which our intelligence agencies continuously have to operate. That very fast pace means that the committee that oversees our intelligence agencies therefore also has to work at that pace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In those two years that I've been on the intelligence and security committee I've come to appreciate more than ever the vital role that our intelligence agencies and our intelligence personnel play in protecting Australians and securing their future. On 25 April we as a nation rightly stop to recognise and commemorate our ADF veterans, more than 103,000 of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice. But rarely do we hear about our intelligence agencies and their personnel and the work they do both domestically and internationally to keep us safe. I think it behoves us all to stop, pause and reflect on the sacrifices our intelligence agencies make, as well as our DFAT staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the privilege of visiting quite a number of our missions overseas. Let me tell you, they're not all like what you might see in Washington DC or in the movies. Some of the conditions in which our DFAT staff operate are very, very austere and, dare I say, very, very dangerous. We cannot thank those personnel—our foreign intelligence services and our domestic intelligence services—enough. I think it really is important that we don't just recognise our veterans who pull on our military uniforms, but we should be recognising them as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023 goes some way to supporting our intelligence agencies and their personnel in response to some of the recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Comprehensive </span><span style="font-style:italic;">review </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">legal framework </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">national intelligence community</span> report—which was an absolutely huge body of work that was done by Dennis Richardson. It aims to protect the identities of staff of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It further strengthens Australia's security assessment framework. It addresses issues related to security vetting and security clearance related activities, particularly around the protection of intelligence information and documents, and it delineates clear authorisation processes for certain intelligence activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our intelligence and law enforcement personnel are among the bravest and most patriotic Australians. They put themselves in harm's way to protect Australians and our interests. As I remarked earlier, they apply themselves to challenging and critical work, often in the most dangerous and high-tempo environments. They're linguists, they're translators, they're cryptographers, they're cybersecurity professionals, they're<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>operatives, they're operational staff, they're analysts and they're accountants. They're ordinary men and women who love their country and want to safeguard it long into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are people like James Arnold, whose 34 years in the intelligence field saw him become a subject matter expert in counterterrorism intelligence; like Ellen Grace, Ailsa Hale and Coral Hinds—members of the 'Garage Girls'—who worked with the Australian Women's Army Service and the Central Bureau in Brisbane deciphering and communicating vital intelligence signals in support of Allied forces across the Pacific; and like Dr John Moss, whose three decades of service in financial and criminal intelligence has allowed Commonwealth law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent and disrupt the financing of terror, money laundering and serious crime. These five courageous and talented Australians are recent recipients of Australian Intelligence Medals and have been honoured for their distinguished service to the national intelligence community and to the security of our country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of so many of our intelligence personnel goes unnoticed, unrecognised and unreported, and the fact is that the vast bulk of our intelligence agency personnel wouldn't have it any other way. Every day their work goes unreported is another day that Australians have been kept safe from the threats beyond our waters and within our borders. Every day that we enjoy our freedom, democracy and security is a testament to their hard work and their bravery. </span>

When you swim at the Currimundi Lake, you can thank our intelligence and defence personnel and our first responders. When you bike through Beerwah, meander through Maleny and Montville, and play with the kids at the playground in Palm View, you can thank our intelligence and defence personnel and our first responders. We would not be the safe, strong and secure nation that we are without them. On behalf of the people of Fisher, I want to thank the men and women of the national intelligence community for their continued service to the Commonwealth of Australia. We can never say thank you enough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to improve employment arrangements and associated protections for current and former employees of ASIO, ASIO affiliates, ASIS and the Australian Signals Directorate. The bill will also consolidate several existing secrecy offences as they relate to ASIO, ASIS, the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation and the Defence Intelligence Organisation. Importantly, records which identify ASIO or ASIS agents, employees, affiliates and other operatives will be made exempt under the Archives Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also aims to respond to the rapidly advancing digital and media landscape by modernising the publication offence under the ASIO Act which criminalises the publication of the identity of any current or former ASIO employee or affiliate. At present, the legislation explicitly identifies newspaper, print publications, radio broadcast and television as methods which are outlawed. This amendment will remove those listed publication methods to accommodate shifting digital media and social media platforms. This would make section 92 of the ASIO Act reflective of the changes made to section 41 of the Intelligence Services Act, consistent with the other publication offences related to intelligence offences. By imposing a blanket ban rather than designated methods of publication, the amendment avoids any potential gap arising in the law which could see digital publication or some future method of publication exempted from prosecution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will also enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence to authorise ASIS, ASD and AGO, the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, to undertake activities relating to an Australian person who is likely to be involved in activities that are likely to be a threat to security before the Attorney-General gives his or her agreement to the authorisation. The authorisation will not take effect until the Attorney-General's agreement has been obtained, however. This comes after recommendation 2 of the comprehensive review, which recommended that the sequencing of steps required in the Intelligence Services Act's ministerial authorisation process be adjusted to enable the responsible minister to authorise a certain intelligence activity. The aim is to streamline ministerial processes to respond to the security threats more quickly. Intelligence must be accountable and agile. A more efficient process, which still meets the requisite checks and balances, is crucial as Australia combats growing threats to our national security and sovereignty, as we saw on<span style="font-style:italic;"> Four Corners</span> just last night. The legislation will remove the ability for a junior minister to exercise a power under the ASIO Act or the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, reflecting the standard practice in authorising intelligence activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also aims to support quicker processing of non-prejudicial security clearance suitability assessments by permitting the Director-General of Security to delegate their power or function to furnish non-prejudicial security clearance suitability assessments. This amendment would maintain that the Director-General of Security could delegate a power or function under section 82D(1) to an ASIO employee or affiliate serving at an executive level or in a more senior role, so long as the application was for a prejudicial security clearance suitability assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill then allows the director-general to delegate the power or function for non-prejudicial security clearance suitability assessments to an ASIO employee or affiliate who isn't necessarily in an executive level 1 position. This should allow ASIO to expeditiously complete those non-prejudicial security clearance assessments which have contributed to the significant backlog and delays that we've seen over the last several years. In 2022-23 alone, ASIO finalised 35,055 personnel security assessment referrals. Requiring an executive level officer or someone more senior to approve all of those inquiries only makes that process more complex and time-consuming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For accountability purposes, the legislation requires that ASIO notify the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security where certain security clearance decisions and security clearance suitability assessments are not made or furnished within 12 months. This is not just a matter of meeting KPIs; it's about ensuring that our workforce across defence, intelligence, security, government and various areas of public administration is not unnecessarily delayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, this third tranche of measures in response to the comprehensive review aims to modernise and streamline Australia's national intelligence capabilities. The reality is, of course, that our country has not been in a more challenging and precarious position since the end of World War II. The geopolitical pressures are significant, and they are complex. The aggressive and deep rooted nature of foreign interference, influence and espionage is becoming increasingly apparent, and Australia's ability to respond with defence, security and technological capabilities is simply not where it needs to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, I want to acknowledge the remarks of the chair when he talked about the importance of this bill and our whole national intelligence community legislative architecture working in concert with each other to protect and keep safe Australia and our homeland. This is where the government, when it recently announced the National Defence Strategy a couple of weeks ago, is missing the point. I want to send a big shout-out to Senator Jim Molan, who led the charge for a national security strategy, because a national defence strategy is only one aspect of what should be a national security strategy. It's all well and good to have a defence strategy. It's all well and good to have some of the best kit for our ADF personnel. But what we need in this country is an all-encompassing, whole-of-government and, in fact, whole-of-society approach to the security of this nation, and Jim Molan led the charge for that when he was a senator in this place. The late great Senator Molan was an exponent of the importance of a national security strategy, one that encompassed not just government of all three tiers but industry, our critical infrastructure. Every element—communications, defence industry, all elements of our community—needs to be brought together to operate as one under a national security strategy to keep our country safe, and I implore the government to investigate it and implement it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to the continual improvement of our national security laws to ensure our agencies are best equipped to continue their work to do exactly that—to keep Australia safe and to protect our way of life. To ensure these laws are keeping pace with an evolving security landscape, our government is introducing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023. This bill is the latest in a series of targeted reforms to ensure intelligence agencies remain able to undertake their important work and undertake their functions efficiently, effectively and with appropriate oversight. This bill also addresses 12 of the recommendations of the 2019 Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the NIC, the national intelligence community. The bill supports Australia's national security agencies by: strengthening identity protections for their employees; improving operational flexibility and the ability of ASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, to communicate information; providing greater certainty as to who can provide authorisations for various activities; and supporting quicker processing of security clearance suitability assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also promotes increased oversight, through supporting the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS, with the oversight of ASIO, by requiring ASIO to provide notifications to IGIS in certain circumstances relating to their security assessment and security clearance activities and making it clear that only the Attorney-General can exercise certain powers. The bill amends a number of pieces of legislation to address operational challenges facing the NIC, the National Intelligence Community, by refining the framework for ASIO security assessments; amending the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to ensure the efficient and effective operation of ASIO security vetting and clearance related functions; enhancing protections for the identities of ASIO employees, affiliates and agents of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, and the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD; and amending authorisation frameworks for certain intelligence activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the 2019 comprehensive review, led by Dennis Richardson AC, as quickly as possible, with the bill addressing 12 of these recommendations. The comprehensive review found that the legislative framework governing our intelligence agencies has been well maintained and is largely fit for purpose but that targeted reforms are required to ensure that our laws continue to keep pace with the ever-changing technological and security landscape of the times in which we live. The comprehensive review made a total of 203 recommendations. Given the total number of legislative measures arising out of the government response to that comprehensive review, implementation is being pursued progressively and seriously by our government.</span>

Again, I say thank you to all those who are working so diligently, putting their lives on the line, and doing so with at times great sacrifice for their families, in order to keep us a safe and free people under the Southern Cross.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023. As has been pointed out by previous speakers, every day and often in the dark of night there are people working to protect Australians. Their work is often secret, unseen and, by a large part of the community, unacknowledged. The first and most important responsibility of any government is to keep Australians safe, and I want to start this address by acknowledging those men and women in the intelligence services who serve the interests of our nation and the safety of all Australians. Your work is appreciated and you are appreciated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As, I think, the member for Fisher was saying, on Anzac Day we think about those men and women in uniform and the decisive battles that have been won in the name of freedom in the past and the kit, as he put it. We can think of the Spitfire, the frigate, the submarine and all of those sorts of things and of some of the big battles that we talk about. Also, in the history of conflicts such as World War II, we can look back at some of the intelligence victories that weren't acknowledged at the time, because they couldn't be, but were decisive in turning the nature of that conflict towards righteousness and freedom. An example of that is Operation Mincemeat, which I recommend people read about. It's a fascinating story. There was also the cracking of the Enigma code. In recent times there's also been some incredible work by our intelligence services which has resulted in the protection of Australians and the saving of Australian lives, and I want to acknowledge that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023 contains a number of provisions to amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, the ASIO Act; the Intelligence Services Act 2001; the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979; and the Archives Act 1983. Those changes support our intelligence agencies by strengthening the protections around the identity of employees, improving the ability of ASIO to communicate information and providing additional protections for individuals by making the communication of certain information a prescribed administrative action. It increases the operational flexibility through updated approval processes for certain activities, and it clarifies the provisions relating to certain intelligence activities and can allow for quicker processing of non-prejudicial security clearance suitability assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of these changes come from the recommendations of the Richardson review. The Richardson review was a comprehensive review of the legal framework of our national intelligence community, commissioned by the former coalition government. Former Secretary of the Department of Defence Dennis Richardson AC released the unclassified version of his report in 2020. In its response, the coalition government agreed with the 12 recommendations that are addressed in this bill, but this bill, I acknowledge, goes further. It includes issues that were not addressed in the Richardson review, and these are clarifying amendments that support the review recommendations. On the face of it they are sensible measures that align with the broad intent of the bill. Any legislation relating to our intelligence services tries to balance the necessary transparency that we have in a democratic system of government with security operations that, by their very nature, are not always transparent. I think this bill does a good job, as previous speakers have said, of trying to ensure that balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the PJCIS for their work in making some recommendations in relation to this legislation. I think it's very heartening to see that, on an issue such as this, we come into this place and debate issues, as we need to—that's the nature of democracy. When it comes to the security of Australia and how we structure our intelligence arrangements, it is essential that the parties of government in particular work together in the common interest, and I think we saw that with the chair and deputy chair—the member for Wills and the member for Fisher—and the other members of that committee. I'd just emphasise that, whilst crossbench members can make positive contributions to the debate in this country, these critical activities need to be agreed on and worked on by parties of government, because those are the people who are going to be responsible for this at some point. I just make that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are actors in the world who would do us harm. I think it's critically important that we work together as a parliament to make sure that we have arrangements, particularly in relation to intelligence gathering, counterterrorism and all the other important work that goes on within the intelligence communities and the intelligence agencies, that are supported by this place. If we support those who work in those industries, we are supporting our fellow Australian citizens to feel and be safe in a world that is increasingly not safe. On that note, I commend this bill to the House and, again, thank the PJCIS for their work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I thank the member for Nicholls and the other members who have participated in a really constructive debate about the legislation that's before the parliament this afternoon. The National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 3) Bill 2023 is the latest tranche of legislative amendments implementing recommendations from the 2019 Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the National Intelligence Community. Additionally, the bill contains other targeted amendments identified as necessary by the intelligence community. The bill introduces amendments that will clarify and enhance the scope of the security assessment framework in part IV of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, strengthen protection for the identities and records containing identity information of certain intelligence personnel, clarify and enhance the authorisation processes for certain intelligence activities, and refine ASIO's functions regarding the security vetting and security clearance related activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note that we're having a debate about this bill, which principally relates to the roles and responsibilities of and laws governing ASIO, in the context of what has been a really difficult time for national security in our country, with some recent events that have shocked the community. I want to briefly speak about the role that ASIO in particular has played in protecting the community so well over previous years. Probably not many Australians are aware of the work of this organisation, but ASIO and security organisations within the Commonwealth have assisted in thwarting 22 terrorist attacks that would otherwise have occurred in our country in the last decade. They do that because we've got a really mature system here, a system where state and federal authorities work really well together. The people who work in these amazing organisations are deep, thoughtful people who think a lot about the problems that they face and the manner in which they undertake their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our organisations are excellent, in part because of their ability to change consistently according to the shape and the scope of the threat that they face. This is particularly relevant, because some of the attacks that we've seen over the last little period have actually been quite different to the type of terrorist incident that ASIO and other organisations were focused on, if we roll back, perhaps, for a decade. One of the things that has changed quite dramatically about the shape of our terrorist threat in this country is the way in which people are targeting terrorist attacks today. If we think back to the 9/11 tragedy and the extent of elaborate planning, financing and work that went into setting up that attack, we see something quite different today—for example, in a recent incident in Australia where a teenager used a knife at very short notice allegedly to attack someone violently. Something else that we see that's very challenging for our national security agencies is a much faster time of what they call 'from clash to bang'. What that means is the process that someone goes through from radicalisation, to thinking about violence and then to actually committing an act of violence is getting narrower and narrower. This, of course, creates really significant challenges for our law enforcement officials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that I want to mention is the very obvious presentation of young people as part of the issue here. This is a very significant transformation in the way that this problem has presented itself to our country. When I talk to the ASIO staff about some of what they've seen over previous years, they talk about seeing a very significant uptick of young people in the alleged and potential terrorist cohort when we came out of COVID. They say to me that this is about young people who are being removed from their community, who are not doing things like going to school and playing sport but who are, instead, spending inordinate amounts of time on the internet and looking at materials that are a negative influence on those young people. I make this point because I know a lot of parents around the country are looking at this. It's not the only instance which is making parents really worried about the way in which young people in this country are being influenced, the way in which they are being raised and the way that we, as a parliament and as a community, can make sure there are strong, positive influences in the lives of young people around our country. This is something I talk to ASIO staff about a lot. These are security and intelligence professionals, but they will be the first to tell you that by the time a matter lands in the lap of ASIO it's already gone too far. We've got to think much more, as a community and as a parliament, about how we're going to make sure that we intervene as early as possible to make sure that we keep our community safe. There aren't many countries in the world where the intelligence organisations are respected to the degree that they are here in Australia. I want to use this opportunity to thank ASIO and to thank our other security and intelligence agencies, on behalf of the federal parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the bill: the government accepts recommendation 1 made by the PJCIS. I note that reporting will remain consistent with ASIO's approach to releasing information about its activities through its annual report. This approach balances the need for transparency against the risk of compromising national security through the inclusion of classified appendices which are provided to the Minister for Home Affairs, the Leader of the Opposition, the PJCIS, the IGIS and the INSLM.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  John Barounis is a Maryborough champion and, like me, is committed to making our homes, streets and public spaces safer; improving health services; building safer roads; and supporting real action to combat Queensland's youth crime crisis. Both in business and through his work in the community, John has a proven track record of working to advance the Maryborough community. When John and his wife Tricia's son, Yanni, died by suicide in 2019, they channelled their grief into action, honouring Yanni's legacy by championing youth mental health awareness and by working with me to establish Maryborough's headspace service. John is now offering his talent, skills and experience to the community by putting his hand up to represent Maryborough in the Queensland parliament as part of David Crisafulli's LNP team.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all seen the multiple failures of the Miles Labor government on youth crime, integrity, health and the Olympics, cost-of-living pressures and their abysmal failure to get going on the four-lane Tiaro bypass. Maryborough needs a strong and passionate voice in the Queensland parliament to turn our state around. John Barounis will be that voice and will continue to do great things for the Maryborough community.</span>

The association was formed in 1972, over 50 years ago, and has been providing outreach and support to the community ever since. The organisation has gone from strength to strength over that time because of so many volunteers who have taken time away from their families to make significant differences and donations so the charitable works of the organisation can continue.</span>

I acknowledge the work of the president, Mr Hermiz Shahen, and the deputy president, David David, for their guidance of the council over many years. A blessing was also provided by the Reverend Father Ramen Youkhanis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  I rise to speak about community radio in Millicent. Community radio stations across the country play an important role, providing a voice for communities, particularly in rural, regional and remote areas where access to commercial radio stations and genuinely local news may be sparse. One such radio station is 5THE FM in Millicent, which broadcasts to the surrounding areas, including Beachport, Southend, Furner and Hatherleigh, just to name a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From humble beginnings in the mid-1980s, when $25,000 was raised from cake stalls over a four-year period to purchase the equipment needed to broadcast, the first test transmission was conducted in May 1987. The old Millicent railway station was transformed into a different sort of station and now broadcasts contemporary and specialist music, multicultural programs and community information 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the station has recently experienced some difficult times. Those difficult times led to the transmitter being turned off in late 2022 due to a loss of its broadcasting licence. With a brand-new skill based board, chaired by Mr David Walshaw, a temporary 12-month licence was granted in July last year. I visited the station over the weekend to congratulate the committee and volunteers for being recently awarded a five-year community radio broadcasting licence by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. This is a testament to the new board and presenters—their dedication, their professionalism—and I wish them all the very best for the future.</span>

Bob was a media man—he had his own media company—but he was also chairman of the Rotary District 9685 polio committee, the Rotary International End Polio coordinator for the zone and chairman of the history and archives committee that put together the centenary of Rotary in Australia book alongside the late Paul Henningham. I was very pleased to provide a copy of that book to the Parliamentary Library in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Bob's funeral at St Finbar's in Glenbrook, we heard of his early life in Parkes and his sporting achievements. We also heard about his love for his local community, no matter where he lived, first in Parkes and then for many decades in Lapstone in the lower mountains. He was a cadet journalist at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parkes Champion Post</span>, becoming the editor and then going on to be managing editor before moving towards Sydney and taking up the role at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rotary Down Under</span> magazine. He was an extraordinary man, and we will all miss him very much. The community is really going to feel his loss.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Recently, Orange was transformed into a boogie wonderland thanks to the 2024 Stars of Orange fundraiser. The event pairs local business and community leaders with a local dance school. Over 10 weeks participants raise money for Cancer Council New South Wales before raising the roof at a gala evening as they jive like Ginger Rogers or nae nae like Napoleon Dynamite. This year more than 630 people gathered to watch this year's stars shimmy, shake and cha-cha slide their way towards a record $315,000. Congratulations to this year's movers and shakers and the talented dance studios that help the stars shine. There were Will Miller and Maggie Morris with United Dance; Peita and Rob Mages with Colour City Dance; Dannielle Ford with Dance HQ; Johanna Scott with United Dance; Jack Churchill with EmDance; and Dr Andrew Parry and a team of teachers from Kinross Wolaroi School, taught by students, including Tilly Quigley, Niamh Webster, Emily Clunas and Georgia Williams. There were also Kylie Duncan with Revolution Aerial; Jessica Hickman with New Generation Dance; Sally Dowling, Julia Homard and Parlour O hairdressers with Dance HQ; and Danica Bunch with Millthorpe Ballet and Performance Studio. Great work, Danica.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Recently I had the great pleasure of hosting the Minister for Social Services in my electorate of Bennelong for a visit to one of our great local volunteer-run organisations. The minister and I headed over to the Riding for the Disabled Association in Ryde, one of the 26 organisations that received over $66,000 in funding through the latest round of federal government volunteer grants. Riding for the Disabled is an extraordinary organisation run by extraordinary volunteers. It helps kids and adults through therapeutic horse-related activities. Each week, they run 10 therapy classes, serving approximately five to six riders per session. This includes individual riders and groups from our four local special-needs units in our public primary schools. They've used these grants for a new computer system, a more efficient fridge and now the acquisition of some battery powered garden tools to help manage their property and, of course, to help lower their emissions. The minister and I also got to meet the horses, who do plenty of the work at Ryde RDA. They've got seven horses on site. Maybe one was called Gertrude! But their newest horse was in training. It's called 'Bendigo' and is sponsored by the local Bendigo Bank in Epping.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all volunteer organisations that received these important grants. From power tools to defibrillators, fuel vouchers and laptops to break down the digital divide, these grants recognise the importance of volunteering in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Anzac Day rightfully honours those who have fought and given their lives for our nation since World War I, and this anniversary has always been important to me, but, as a member of the North Sydney community, I've also learned to honour the day before Anzac Day, 24 April, as a day that marks a horrendous unanswered crime against humanity. Many of the Anzacs who returned to Australia in 1915 brought with them harrowing tales of the attempted annihilation of the Armenian population by the Ottoman Empire. Those diggers spoke of Armenian men being rounded up and killed, and of Armenian women and children being displaced from their homes and deported, enslaved or forcibly integrated into Turkish households. And yet, 109 years since the world witnessed the mass murder of more than 1½ million Armenians, and over a million Assyrians and Greeks, at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, our government—regardless of which major political party was running it—is yet to recognise these events as an act of genocide.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As painful as it is, the world must acknowledge the horrors that were committed under the guise of World War I as genocide so that we can unite against such atrocities ever happening again. I'm standing with the Armenian community in North Sydney and once again call on the Australian government to recognise the Armenian genocide so we can move forward towards reconciliation and healing.</span>

I recently had the privilege of meeting Caroline upon a visit to the Ettalong Baptist Church, where I was meeting with the church pastor, David Gilchrist, and office manager, Lynette Tilden. During my visit I was informed about the 'Ministry of Leftovers'. The Ministry of Leftovers supports people in my community with affordable second-hand items. It is also a place for the community to drop in for friendship, care and a listening ear. There is also a free cafe for the community to enjoy, as well as a range of activities to get involved in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Caroline started the Ministry of Leftovers seven years ago. At first, it only operated for a few days every month. Fast forward to today, and it operates four times a week and is supported by up to 20 volunteers—an absolutely mammoth effort. Caroline began the initiative because of her deep faith in Jesus Christ and his love for all in our community. She demonstrates this love through the Ministry of Leftovers. Caroline is also passionate about reducing waste, and she's also passionate about reusing otherwise good items again for use in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I'm pleased to inform the House that King Island has now secured a regional study hub. In my maiden speech to this parliament in 2019, I said that where you live should not be a barrier to the education that you receive. But for our region, which covers the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania, and King Island, access to education past high school has been difficult. It was a priority of mine and was a priority of the former Liberal-National government to close that gap. During my first term, and thanks to the federal government's investment, the redevelopment of the University of Tasmania's Cradle Coast campus in Burnie became a reality. It has given local kids the opportunity to gain a university education without leaving our region. Again, it was the Liberal-National government which began to invest in remote higher education through our Regional Study Hub program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we had the study hub at the West Coast, followed by the University of Tasmania's Burnie campus. Next was the study centre at Circular Head and now we have the last piece in the puzzle: the study hub on King Island. These are four facilities that signal a new era in higher education across the north-west, West Coast and King Island. For local people, accessing tertiary education locally is exactly the way it should be no matter where you live.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Many of us spend a great deal of time with our constituents, discussing what we can deliver for them as their members of parliament. This Sunday, I will be out doorknocking in Virginia and speaking to residents about what others can deliver instead: convincing Australia Post to deliver mail to their homes, after many unsuccessful attempts over the years. Close to 150 concerned locals in Virginia have approached my office, expressing frustration with Australia Post placing the street-side delivery of their mail in the too-hard basket. This changed after raising their concerns with the CEO of Australia Post. As a result, many in Virginia may have noticed a letter being delivered directly to their homes earlier this month. But, unless they act, it may be the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That letter contained their household's voting form as part of a mail delivery poll of the local area by Australia Post. At 5 pm on 31 May, if more than half the area polled have stamped their approval, this proposal will no longer need to push the envelope but instead be signed, sealed and delivered. Over the remaining fortnight, I encourage everyone in Virginia who received a ballot to think outside of the PO Box so Australia Post receives the message loud and clear. Cast your vote together as a community and win together as one, too. And here's just a reminder that if you don't vote that's classified as a 'no' vote. We need to get this over the line. Please vote yes, and get your vote in ASAP.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Why has the Bureau of Statistics been so coy about its new official method of estimating excess deaths? In July 2023, the ABS released a new model to calculate excess deaths, created retrospectively and reporting six monthly, not monthly. How can timely action be taken on excess deaths with such infrequent reporting? This change is very disturbing, given we had excess deaths in the range of 6.9 to 15.9 per cent above the historical average during 2021, 2022 and 2023. The ABS twice changed the way it calculates excess deaths during the pandemic years, and both times it made changes which show fewer excess deaths are estimated. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the new method for excess deaths shows 24,351 excess deaths between January 2020 and 27 August 2023. This is in stark contrast to the previous method, which would have shown 56,058 excess deaths to the end of 2023. This is more than twice the number being reported under the new model. The new model is a complicated mathematical equation, and the ABS have not been transparent about how they chose this new model, which rewrites the history of the pandemic. Is it possible that the model was chosen to minimise excess deaths or to make it appear that all excess deaths were due to COVID? Australians can handle the truth and they deserve to know.</span>

A Commonwealth budget is the culmination of many months of hard work by many people.

They are hurting under the cost-of-living pressures that have been made worse by the mismanagement of this government. The Reserve Bank sent a strong message last week that action is needed on inflation.

Born out of a disappointing performance at the Montreal Olympics, the AIS quickly became a centre of cutting-edge sports training, coaching and science, bringing together expertise and athletes across disciplines at a modern campus.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the AIS has been the envy of the world in the past, it's clear that underinvestment in the facilities and programs led to uncertainty about its ongoing future. The NBA understood its value, locating one of its few global academies at the Bruce campus—with almost immediate success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's taken a Labor government to get the AIS back on track. After a decade of neglect from those opposite, we are investing in the AIS to ensure that our athletes have world-class training and sports science facilities ahead of the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Albanese government will provide $249.7 million for the Australian Sports Commission to revitalise the AIS—the largest investment in the AIS since its establishment. It will allow our world-class athletes, coaches and sports scientists to be the best they can, while inspiring generations of Australians to follow in their footsteps. We're getting on with delivering a better future for all Australians—one that's made in Australia and builds opportunity and thriving communities.</span>

It's time to shine a spotlight on the Treasurer. I'm told that this morning the Treasurer almost quoted the Little River Band—'Hang on, help is on its way,' apparently—but, unfortunately, I don't think that's the case. When the Treasurer strides up to the dispatch box, the music that leads him in should be Kenny Rogers's 'The Gambler':</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately for the Australian people, this Labor Treasurer will roll them. He's going to roll the dice on the Australian people's wealth. He's going to roll the dice on their income. He's going to roll the dice on the Australian balance sheet. And I think that is a disgrace, because it will drive inflation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this to the Treasurer: this is not a game of Monopoly. You are not playing with Monopoly money; you are playing with the wealth of the nation. And the nation deserves better than putting fuel on the inflation fire that is homemade, and is homemade by this Labor government. This Labor government has increased spending by $209 billion in the last two years. Real wages have gone backwards by 7½ per cent; that is a direct impact on the individuals who need help and assistance. As we know from Kenny Rogers and his song 'The Gambler', the gambler broke even, and what a tragedy it is for the Australian people that that's the best they can hope for from this Treasurer and this Labor government.</span>

Like 45 per cent of my electorate of Holt, English is not my first language. Over 165 languages are spoken across Holt, from Punjabi and Hazaraghi to Serbian and Samoan. Languages are vital for people to engage in their culture, traditions and community. Community language schools, often run by volunteers, are essential in teaching children these languages. This is why I am proud to be part of a government committed to supporting these vital community assets.</span>

In 2021, the Pilbara community was promised $12.8 million for a new hospital. Three years on, this hardworking community has been let down. Unbelievably, the recent WA state budget has allocated a mere $77,000 for the new hospital for the next financial year. The current hospital is 57 years old and should be condemned. Even the mice and frogs have now taken up residency. Patients confined to their beds tell me that they've seen the rodents scurrying above their heads as they lie waiting for medical assistance. Staff and patients are subjected to out-of-date and dangerous equipment. But all credit is due to the amazing staff, who continue to deliver under these conditions.</span>

Clearly, it's not about money; it's all about priorities. With the<span style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  "></span><span style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">state government's</span> $2.6 billion surplus, there is no excuse for ignoring Tom Price's critical need for adequate health care. So to the health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson: please, Minister, do your job and stop attacking hardworking shire president Audra Smith, who is doing nothing but supporting her community. Together, Audra and I will continue to fight for this community.</span>

The coalition, whose economic and legislative mess we are still cleaning up, are continually trying to tell Australians that they are somehow the better economic managers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Treasury figures show that the Abbott government added $48 billion to government debt, the Turnbull government added $31 billion to debt and the Morrison government added $50 billion to debt. Meanwhile, the Albanese government has paid down debt, having back-to-back surpluses. What about taxation? Do Labor governments tax more, as Senator Hume was excitedly claiming today? No. Statistics show that the two highest governments for tax over the last 30 years were the Howard and Turnbull governments. The three lowest were Labor governments. What about international recognition? Did a Liberal Treasurer ever get a 'world's greatest Treasurer' award from <span style="font-style:italic;">Euromoney</span> magazine? No. But Paul Keating did, followed by Wayne Swan in 2011 in recognition of Labor's excellent handling of the economy during the global financial crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we will see a budget, delivered by the Treasurer, where all Australians will share in $107 billion worth of tax cuts, where we will have turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus and where we will have halved inflation since 2022. Australians can trust Labor with the economy. The facts speak for themselves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  One thing we know about tonight's budget is that there's absolutely no new money for housing. There's nothing to address Labor's housing crisis: no new money, no new homes, no new ideas, no new thinking—just the same old Labor housing crisis. We saw the Labor Party try to rebadge and rehash funding that has been ongoing for 15 years now and somehow claim that it as new. The truth is that under this government we've seen the number of first home buyers go down and we've seen the number of homes go down. Most worryingly, if Australians think there's a housing crisis now, it is just going to get worse, because the number of approvals has gone down even further. That means that over the next 12 months, 18 months or two years fewer homes will be built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time when fewer homes were being built and fewer Australians were able to afford to own their own home, this government ramped up migration and brought in four times as many migrants as the number of houses being built. Where on earth does the government think they will live? What this is doing is putting pressure on our rental market. It's putting pressure on every single Australian family. And, sadly, tonight we see no recognition from this government that it has created a housing crisis and that it has an obligation to address it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I've heard from so many in my community—students, parents and grandparents—about how student loan debt is too high and how change is needed. Our government has listened to these concerns and has changed the way these debts are indexed. As well, it has wiped the costs of last year's spike in the CPI indexation rate. Three million people across our country, including 22,264 people in Jagajaga, will receive a cut in their student debt. A person with an average debt of $26,500 can expect $1,200 to be wiped from their outstanding loans this year. We know times are tough and these changes will provide significant relief for all Australians with a student debt. Last Monday, I met with La Trobe University students in my electorate who are going to benefit from this change. They told me about how these changes will reduce their fears about what taking on a university debt might mean for their future; how it will make them feel more stable about getting a foot in the door in homeownership, establishing themselves with a secure footing.</span>

Thank you to all in my community who advocated for this important change. We have listened to you. We are making lives easier for Australian students, putting them on the best pathway to the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the deaths on 13 April 2024 of Yixuan Cheng, Pikria Darchia, Ash Good, Dawn Singleton, Faraz Tahir and Jade Young, place on record its acknowledgement of their contributions to their communities, and tender its sympathy to their families in their bereavement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A month on from the shocking events at Bondi Junction Westfield, the distress has barely faded. The grief never will. It should have been just another Saturday, the unremarkable happiness of people going about their lives, shopping. That's so familiar, I think, to just about every Australian. Everything changed in just a few minutes that day—just a handful of minutes that changed so much forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mourn all those whose lives were wrenched from them so brutally and so pointlessly: Yixuan Cheng, an economics student; Pikria Darchia, an artist; Ash Good, an osteopath and new mum, whose final thoughts were for the safety of her baby, Harriet; Dawn Singleton, who was looking forward to her wedding; Faraz Tahir, the Westfield security guard whose funeral I attended, where I got such a poignant sense of the new life he was creating for himself here in Australia; and Jade Young, an architect and loving mother. We mourn for all the wonderful, rich possibility of life that was taken from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we mourn for all those whose lives will always feel the weight of loss, their every heartbeat tempered by a sorrow for what might have been, the parents who lost a son or daughter, a baby who will grow up knowing her mum only through photographs and the stories from her family, who are now holding her tight in love. I had the privilege of meeting her father, her grandfather and other members of the family at a private occasion recently, and it's beyond comprehension, the grief that they are dealing with. We mourn for those who lost their partners, their soulmates—love torn apart, plans shattered, futures robbed. As Elizabeth Young said in her eulogy for her daughter, Jade: 'Our lives have been fractured; there will be no back to normal. There is no normal for us now.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think of the wounded. That Saturday in Bondi was a hinge on which their whole lives turned. We want them to know they are in our hearts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As are the shop workers. Amid the fear and the horror of what was unfolding, they somehow found within themselves a strength to be a source of calm to others. Many are still hurting, and I want them to know that they too are in the nation's hearts. They stepped up, as did others, like Faraz Tahir, who ran towards danger; Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot, armed with just chairs and a bollard; and, of course, New South Wales police inspector Amy Scott, who so decisively and so courageously ran towards danger. Not knowing what she was going to confront there at Westfield, she ran by herself towards danger and brought this devastation to a final end. It was moving to see how many people at the vigil lined up to share a moment with her and express their gratitude and their admiration to the paramedics, ambulance people, police officers and emergency service workers who rushed to the scene as well to provide support to people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day after this tragedy, on the Sunday, when I travelled to Sydney to be there, along with the member for Wentworth, the New South Wales Premier and police ministers, the New South Wales member for Vaucluse, and others who were there to lay a floral tribute, it was really noticeable how many people there were there with yellow bibs on so they could be easily identified to provide mental health support for people who were there. The swiftness of the response, given the circumstances which were there, should forever give praise to the actions of our New South Wales Police, emergency service workers, health workers and others—those people who were called back onto shift to look after people at St Vincent's Hospital and other hospitals as well, and the security agencies who provided to me, here in this building, very swift and clear and accurate information about what had occurred, which, under the circumstances, was really quite remarkable. We can be proud of everyone who played a role that day and that, at the worst of times, we once again saw the best of the Australian character: remarkable acts of courage, remarkable acts of compassion, remarkable acts of love. I spoke with the member for Wentworth that night. It was a very difficult time, and I praise her for the work of a local member that no local member wants to engage with. It was very fine representation indeed of her local community at what was a very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we have any small solace—and it's impossible, of course, to think that anything good comes from something like that—it is that humanity really stood tall on those days—and since, it must be said. May the survivors heal. May the people who are dealing with trauma and loss recover to the extent that they can. They will never be the same, of course, and that's something that they need to come to terms with. The nature of this attack means that there were many thousands of people in that shopping centre. I am familiar with it—it's not my part of Sydney, but just about everyone who has lived in Sydney has had reason to call in to go to the movies or to engage on the way to the beach, or to pick something up. It is a very large shopping centre there at Bondi Junction; the mall and the community there in Bondi Junction were packed the day after, and the tributes continue to be made. Today, we add our voice from our national parliament to those tributes, to show our respect for those whose lives were so pointlessly taken away, for the families and for those who are still doing it really tough. We say that we hope that those who were lost that day are able to rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his heartfelt and very fitting words, and I join with him in expressing the coalition's condolences to the victims, and their families, of one man's murderous rampage at Westfield Bondi Junction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saturday 13 April will always be remembered as a day defined by contrast. There was panic, but there was also presence of mind. There was fear, but there was also fortitude. There was cruelty, but there was also compassion. There was hate, but there was also heroism. There was human tragedy, but there was also a triumph of the human spirit. Terrible events become etched in our national consciousness not only because they are tragic but also because the place and circumstances surrounding the tragedy are always chillingly familiar and relatable. We can all recall times when we've said to a loved one or a loved one has said to us: 'I'm just off to the shops. I'll be back in a couple of hours.' That's all the more reason why our hearts break for the victims. They were everyday Australians simply doing what we see Australians do every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I again pay my respects to the six people murdered on that terrible afternoon. Dawn Singleton was a young woman who was starting out her career. She had a smile that warmed hearts and was a bride-to-be to her partner, Ash. Jade Young was a splendid architect and soft-hearted mother of two girls. She married Noel, her school sweetheart. Ashlee Good was a talented athlete, skilled osteopath and beloved wife of Daniel. In her valiant last moments, she saved her baby girl, Harriet. Pikria Darchia was a designer and artist who migrated to Australia from Georgia and was described by her son, Irakli, as kind, calm, happy and extraordinary. Yixuan Cheng was an economics student from China whose fiance was planning to marry her when she finished her master's degree in Australia. And Faraz Tahir was a refugee from Pakistan whose heroic deeds on his first shift as a security guard saved others that he didn't even know. We remember the six victims today to acknowledge their lives' achievements, to recognise the joy that they brought to so many and to mourn all that they were to do and all that they would have become. Tragedy is not just the loss of what was; tragedy is the loss of what would and could have been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sentiment was palpable at the candlelight vigil held at Bondi Beach on 21 April in memory of the victims, which a number of us here attended. As the Prime Minister rightly pointed out, that included the local members, the mayors and others from the emergency services. We say thank you very much to the member for Wentworth and acknowledge her contribution and the way in which she stood proud as a local leader. She was looked to with great respect and admiration—similarly, the member for Vaucluse and others who were there on that day. The sentiment at the vigil was also palpable in many ways in that crowd that night, and the expressions from people in the crowd about their shock and how they were touched are something that will stay with all of us who had those conversations. But the sentiment was also palpable for those of us who laid floral tributes on Oxford Street in the days after the attack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One month may have passed since this tragedy rocked the nation, but six families have had their lives upended and forever altered. The wider circle of friends and colleagues of each victim will also be grieving or will stoically try to deal with their loss in their own way, but, as Australians, if you know the families, the friends and the colleagues of the six victims, please continue to extend the offer of companionship in our great national spirit. While time never heals loss in tragedy, it is our fellowship as Australians which helps us through tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Altogether, 18 people were stabbed during the rampage at Westfield Bondi Junction. I pay tribute to the brilliant paramedics, nurses, doctors and other healthcare specialists from around Sydney, especially those at St Vincent's Hospital, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, St George Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital and Sydney Children's Hospital. These professionals really are saints. They attended to wounds on the scene, resuscitated patients in emergency rooms, conducted lifesaving surgeries and provided first-class care. They continue to help the victims with their recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the 12 victims who survived the stabbing spree, the nation wishes you all a speedy recovery from your wounds, seen and unseen. I want to make special mention of security guard Muhammad Taha, who lost his colleague Faraz when both brave men ran towards danger and confronted the assailant. In those terrible and terrifying moments, everyday Australians did extraordinary things. There were the deeds of the shopkeepers and their staff. Some of these staff are young Australians, just teenagers working in casual jobs after finishing school or to finance their further studies. They showed courage and wisdom beyond their years in remaining calm and helping shoppers to shelter amid the chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were other everyday Australians just going about their business, just shopping, who helped get people to safety and provided comfort to those in distress. There were people like lifeguard Andrew Reid, who attended to help people with their wounds, or the father who escorted his two children out of the shopping centre, under his shoulders, wearing the eye masks he'd given them to protect their innocence. There were Joe and Rick Tomarchio, the brothers who used clothes from a store to try and stem the bleeding of Ash and Harriet Good and helped save the life of a nine-month-old baby. They are modest men who shun the title of hero, but of course they are heroes, as are the two French tradies—the 'bollard boys' as they've become known—Damien Guerot and Silas Despreaux.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Bondi, bystanders became good Samaritans, and good Samaritans became heroes. But there was no greater hero on that day than New South Wales Police Inspector Amy Scott. She ran towards danger, as the Prime Minister rightly pointed out. She didn't know whether this person had explosive devices or whether others were acting in concert with this individual at the time—all of those details were unknown—but she neutralised the assailant and saved countless lives. She embodied professionalism and poise. We know that we see that very regularly—perhaps way too regularly—as it's required in our men and women who wear that uniform. Inspector Scott deserves our nation's gratitude and praise; indeed, she deserves to join the pantheon of distinguished Australians in being recognised with the Order of Australia. I thank all of the police officers who responded to this knife attack and were part of the subsequent investigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude on this point: we will always remember this terrible incident. We will remember it for its tragedy, but tragedy is also revealing. Amidst the evil, horror and death caused by a murderous rampage, we saw other things too. We saw presence of mind, fortitude, compassion and heroism. We saw the triumph of the human spirit. We saw us, the Australian people. We saw the mettle of our character and the magnitude of our camaraderie. We saw exactly what we're made of and what we're capable of in our darkest hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's never ever forget it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:23</span>):  Thank you to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for your moving words and for coming to our community at one of our most horrible times. Thank you also to the local mayor and the members for Vaucluse and Coogee, who I was proud to work alongside during that terrible week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in my community knows where they were on the afternoon of Saturday 13 April: at home; at the beach, as it was a beautiful afternoon; maybe heading up the coast for school holidays; or in Bondi Junction, where so many of us find ourselves on any given weekend, going to the movies, doing the weekly shop, buying a birthday present or running an errand—just the normal Bondi Junction sort of thing. But the tragedy of that day was anything but normal, and we are still trying to come to terms with it. The grief and the trauma will sit with our community for a long time. Every one of us could have been there ourselves. Every one of us knows someone who was there. Every one of us had that chilling moment of not knowing if our loved ones were safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were many who witnessed terrible trauma and many who were injured on that awful afternoon. Six families are bearing the tragic, unbearable loss that any one of us could have faced. Their hearts are heavy with loss and grief—a burden that cannot be lifted with words or deeds. Their loved ones were like hundreds of other people at Westfield that day: a mum out with her little baby, an artist running an errand, an architect buying a birthday present, a recent migrant to Australia trying to earn money to support his family back home, a student celebrating the end of exams and a bride-to-be preparing for a very special day. All Australians see ourselves or someone we love in that snapshot. Those brief descriptions don't do justice to those we have lost. They cannot be reduced to a phrase. Simple words can't capture their souls, their lives, their complexities and their joys. They were loved; they were cherished. These people were their loved ones' whole world, and that will not change. They were Ashlee Good, Dawn Singleton, Faraz Tahir, Jade Young, Pikria Darchia and Yixuan Cheng, and we are desperately sorry for their loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word I heard most often in the days that passed was 'senseless'. It was an act without sense, without reason; purely destructive of life and love. But, as a community, we cannot let that word 'senseless' be the last word. In the words of Ash Good's family, 'As her loved ones come to terms with her immeasurable loss, they celebrate the positive legacy of her 38 years—her practice of gratitude, her diligence and discipline, but, most of all, her selfless dedication and care for her loved ones, as demonstrated in her final act as a mother.' We must celebrate the positive legacies of those we have lost: the difference in the world that they created, the joy and the love, the people they cared for and the memories that will be cherished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also hold on to the heroism and kindness that so many showed on the day, which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have articulated so beautifully. There was one person who sought to do terrible harm, but there were hundreds who did everything they could to protect others and to provide comfort and care in the darkest hour—like Inspector Amy Scott, who is a local and national hero; like the bollard men, Damien Guerot and Silas Despreaux; like others in the shopping centre who risked their lives; like the retail workers who sheltered and comforted the public; like the first responders; and like the healthcare workers, at St Vincent's Hospital and others, who turned up not on their shift but just because they thought they might be needed and they wanted to be there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must hold on to the care and support our community gave each other in the days and weeks after that tragedy: in the solemn coming together for the laying of flowers, in the candlelight vigil—in just the support and care that each person showed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we must heed the words of Jade Young's mum. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On a personal level, I want Jade's girls to grow up believing there is security, goodness and love in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But also, on another level, I want politicians, both federal and state, to address the gaps in mental healthcare to make it a safer world, for our girls and all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that as parliamentarians we can't always stop the awful things that happen in our wonderful country, even though I believe every one of us wants to. Nothing we can do will bring those beautiful people back. But we can use our heads and our hearts to honour Jade Young's mum's words. We can and we must. There were six people whose beautiful lives were cut short that day. They mattered, and it is up to all of us to honour their memories. The whole community, the whole country and everyone in this place is sorry for their loss.</span>

Prime Minister, 130 hostages still remain in tunnels after the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel last year in which 1,200 people were massacred. Violent antisemitism is on the rise here in Australia and indeed around the world. Why did the Prime Minister make a captain's call to Palestine's bid for United nations membership, breaching faith with our Jewish community and decades of bipartisanship and putting us at odds with allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada?</span>

Of course, this House, with the support of the Labor Party—the government members—as well as the members of the coalition passed a resolution expressing our unequivocal outrage at the events and horror at the terrorist act on October 7. We continue to call for Hamas to release hostages. We continue to express our concern at the loss of life—every life—that is innocent, whether that be an innocent Israeli life or an innocent Palestinian life. Contrary to the Leader of the Opposition's depiction, the Australian government has had a long-term position of support for a two-state solution, and, in this, I accept responsibility for government decisions as Prime Minister. We had a proper process to make that decision through all of our appropriate channels.</span>

That is something that is supported by the Australian Labor Party and has historically been supported by those opposite as well. The people who do not support a two-state solution include Hamas and has included, at times, some members of the current Israeli government, who make clear their opposition to that as well. </span>

In November 2023 Royal Australian Navy divers were injured by sonar pulses fired at them by a Chinese navy destroyer. Ten days ago a Chinese fighter jet fired flares in the flight path of an RAN Seahawk, risking the lives of our people. Why hasn't the Prime Minister called President Xi about these clear acts of intimidation?</span>

This mob were happy to have President Xi speak in this parliament but had no conversations with them the entire time.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  Thanks to the member for Blair, not just for the question but for being a big backer of Australian manufacturing. Creating secure, well-paid jobs doesn't just happen by accident. It requires learning the lessons of history and having absolute, unequivocal ambition for the future. It takes strong leadership, with a vision for what the country can look like, and governments that work for all Australians. We have a big job to do in making the transition to net zero. We're playing catch-up after 10 wasted years under the coalition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to urgently mobilise manufacturing, to make things here, to get us to net zero. In doing so we can cut emissions and grow blue-collar jobs. That's what a future made in Australia is all about, and it's at the heart of tonight's budget. Instead of shipping off our ideas to another country and importing their products, we can seize new ideas and create great jobs: groundbreaking new solar technology not made anywhere else on the planet, like what SunDrive reckons it can do in the Hunter; hydrogen electrolyser manufacturing by Fortescue in Gladstone; Hysata's work in the Illawarra, producing hydrogen that is crucial in manufacturing green metals and keeping steel manufacturing here in the country; and processing critical minerals and turning them into Aussie made batteries, like those made by Gelion in Sydney's west. Solar, hydrogen, green metals, critical minerals and batteries: we have the people, the know-how and the manufacturing muscle to get it done in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, time and again we've seen world-leading Australian know-how go offshore. We have know-how that's created jobs and opportunities and competitive edge for other countries. But this government said, 'Enough is enough.' Enough of the failed policies of the coalition, who sent our car makers packing. After the nasty negativity that poured scorn on manufacturers and cold water on their job creation, for all those years, all we've had from those opposite is constant negativity and no plan. At every opportunity they oppose the chance to back Australian manufacturing. They said no to tax cuts that would have helped manufacturing workers. They said no to the National Reconstruction Fund. They said no to energy price relief that would have helped Australian manufacturing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight's budget will be a budget for every Australian. It will show the difference between a government with a plan, and those in opposition, who oppose everything. We will invest responsibly in Australia's manufacturing future, as opposed to an opposition that mocks manufacturing and calls it a graveyard.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  When two young men died, the New South Wales government introduced mandatory sentences for one-punch attacks. When it was terrorism, laws were changed to jail people on the apprehended risk of crimes. But when Australian men kill Australian women the government's national plan is to take 10 years. In the gallery today are advocates here to hold a vigil for the 192 women killed by men since the 2021 March4Justice. We have a crisis of male violence and women's safety. Will you be tough on this domestic terrorism by leading an overhaul of national sentencing laws, including AVOs?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  I thank the member for Warringah for her question and for raising these issues with me when I visited her electorate of Warringah recently as well. Violence against women is indeed a national crisis. We know that, on average, once every four days a woman is murdered by someone they know, by an intimate partner or a former partner. That is a national crisis. It's a scourge and a stain on our nation, and we need to do better. Governments need to do better, but we as a community need to do better as well, because this is about more than just government action. This is about our whole society and how it functions and about respect for women. We can change it, and we must change it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our record investment in the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children from 2022—I do disagree with her depiction of the national plan—is a recognition that, tragically, you can't solve this overnight. You need to change behaviour across a whole range of ways. We need to change the way the education system works. One of the things that the royal commission in Victoria in 2016 found was that they needed to get that education about respectful relationships in school, and that has happened. One of the things about the national cabinet meeting I convened was that people talked about replicating best practice, and that included the issue of sentencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that New South Wales has made a significant announcement, and I support the stronger action for people who have AVOs—stronger action to make sure that people aren't just released into the community who are a threat to a woman. It's very strong action, indeed. I know that premiers of other states and chief ministers as well agreed at that meeting to look at all of their laws, including bail laws, and to return to the national cabinet. They are state laws; they're not national laws, but we can encourage best practice when it comes to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, through that national cabinet meeting, established permanently the leaving violence payment, and tonight's budget will see $925 million for that. Tonight's budget will also see a billion dollars directed towards crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, the Minister for Communications is doing important work to tackle extreme online misogyny, which is a real issue and something that will be a real focus as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the survivors and people who are working so strongly on this. Of course, a focus on prevention must mean a focus on perpetrators as well. We know the work will be hard. There are no overnight solutions, but we're absolutely committed to working—including with the member for Warringah and across this parliament—on all of these issues to make sure that the scourge which is there is dealt with in the best possible way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:53</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Higgins for the question. Family and domestic violence destroys lives and is absolutely unacceptable in a country like Australia. The safety of women and children experiencing family domestic and sexual violence has been and is a priority for our government. That is why the Prime Minister convened a dedicated national cabinet this month, where all governments committed to build on efforts under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. This plan was developed in partnership with victims-survivors and put victims-survivors at its heart. The national cabinet was clear that all governments will strengthen their efforts to address violence against women and the conditions that enable and promote it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following national cabinet, the Albanese Labor government announced we will establish a permanent Leaving Violence Program to replace the current trials underway. Victims-survivors will now have the certainty of knowing a safety net will be there, should they need it, where they can access up to $5,000 in financial support, safety planning, risk assessment and referral pathways for support. Importantly, the payment will also be indexed annually to ensure it maintains its current value and complements other financial support, like crisis payment. The Leaving Violence Program builds on the improvements we've made to the Escaping Violence Payment Program since we came to government. It became clear in the trial that the trial had not been resourced appropriately to allow for the necessary safety planning and referral support needed by many clients who had never engaged with specialist services before. This investment that we have made complements numerous other investments we've made under the national plan, with more than $3 billion of investment now in safety, which not only responds to the needs of women and children experiencing violence but also, critically, supports the work of preventing violence, intervening before it escalates, and the recovery of victims-survivors.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government legislated 10 days of paid family domestic violence leave for all employees. We've boosted funding to frontline services, which includes restoring the funding under the former government that was due to cease in June last year. We have delivered more safe places for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence, which will assist more than 2,800 women and children each year, and there will be an additional 720 new places available under the next round. We are putting the focus on perpetrators by developing a national risk assessment framework for service providers to manage the risk posed by perpetrators, as well as trialling new perpetrator interventions in partnership with states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the actions our government is taking. We know there's more to do, and we all need to work together—government, civil society, businesses— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australians are poorer than they were two years ago. The cash rate, which this dismal Prime Minister couldn't even name during the campaign, has gone from 0.35 per cent to 4.35 per cent. Real disposable incomes have fallen, soaring energy prices are hurting families and businesses are being crippled by huge cost increases. Why are Australians paying the price for the weak economic leadership of this Prime Minister?</span>

She gets a bonus point for asking a question about the economy on budget day—I'll give that. The truth is that the member opposite raises a range of issues. One is inflation and interest rates. Now, inflation was twice what it is now when they were in office. Inflation peaked at 2.1 per cent in the March 2022 quarter—in just one quarter—whereas now inflation is at 3.6 per cent on an annual basis, which is lower than the 3.75 per cent that was predicted in MYEFO.</span>

They weren't going down; they were going up. Remember the $5½ billion on the French subcontract without delivering a single vessel, and destroying our relationship with our ally there. Remember blowing out the cost of the inferior copper NBN by $29 billion. Then there's the Inland Rail project. They said they were going to build it and finish it for $4.7 billion; it cost $31 billion without going anywhere. They spent $5 billion on contractors and consultants.

The big hike in HECS indexation last year hit a lot of Australians hard—in particular, a lot of young Australians. They made their voice heard, and we've heard it. The budget tonight will wipe about $3 billion of HECS debt for more than three million Australians. As members know, I asked the Universities Accord team to look at this issue, and they recommended that we set indexation at either inflation or wages, whatever is the lowest. We're doing that and we're going further than that. We're going to backdate this to last year. In other words, we're going to wipe out what happened last year and make sure it never happens again. For someone with an average HECS debt of about 26 grand, it means their HECS debt will be cut by about $1,200. For someone with a HECS debt of 45 grand, it will mean their HECS debt is cut by about $2,000. It's an important reform to make HECS fairer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget tonight, for the first time ever, the Commonwealth government will provide financial support to teaching, nursing and social work students to help them while they're doing their prac. These are people who have signed up to do some of the most important jobs in this country—people who are going to help educate our kids, look after us when we're sick or when we're old, support women in domestic violence refuges—and a big part of becoming a teacher or a nurse or a social worker is practical training. They sometimes have to give up their part-time job to do it. So this is a bit of practical help for people while they're doing their practical training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To tell you what it means, I got an email from a nursing student from the member for Bendigo's electorate last week. It said this: 'I just saw your announcement about paid placement for nurses, and I'm crying. You've given me faith that the Labor government really cares about the growth of the whole community. I cannot even explain how much this announcement has benefited me mentally, let alone financially. Thank you for listening to the community.'</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Paid pracs and making HECS fairer are just two parts of our response to the Universities Accord. They help with the cost of degrees and they help with the cost of living. But we've also got to do something about the cost of a lot of young people missing out on the chance to go to university altogether—in particular, young people from our outer suburbs and regional Australia. You'll see what we do there tonight. Ten years ago, the Liberals cut the guts out of education in their 2014 budget. We're building a better and fairer education system, and you'll see that in the budget tonight. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The question, in anyone's interpretation, was very broad, because the question was actually about the price of economic leadership over the last two years, and there was a whole range of issues in the question. So I think, on anyone's definition, this was a pretty broad question, and the Prime Minister now has been specific with his answer regarding the issues raised. So I think everyone can agree it's very relevant.</span>

                  </a>  They're embarrassed by their budget of 10 years ago, when we saw the coalition unplugged. We know that the inflation figure that we inherited was 2.1 per cent in just a quarter, and today annual inflation's at 3.6 per cent. On wages, of course, the biggest drop, outside of the pandemic, in real wages this century occurred in the March quarter of 2022—again, down 1.4 per cent. Our government has seen real wages rising for three consecutive quarters. There was a sluggish labour market under them. Under us, employment growth has doubled—780,000 new jobs created. Productivity under them was the worst in 40 years. Under us, it is up in the last three quarters. Business investment declined, under them, to the lowest levels since the early 2000s. Business investment has grown in every quarter under Labor—up 13 per cent in real terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, budget policy will be there for all to see tonight—something that would be familiar to them. They produced mugs saying that there was a surplus, but that's all it was. They treated Australians like mugs. They never produced a surplus in almost a decade in office. Tonight we will see the second surplus in a row, with a $9.3 billion projected surplus, following on from last year's $22 billion, which is better than the $78 billion deficit that we inherited from them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  Tonight's budget contains an increase in defence spending of $5.7 billion, which on its own terms is the single-largest increase in defence spending over a four-year cycle in decades. It far outstrips any increases that we saw over the lost decade when those opposite were in power. This is an inconvenient truth which sticks in their craw, because, from their perspective, this is just not how it's meant to be. This forms part of a $12.1 billion increase over 10 years, which is also in the budget. When you combine that with the decisions that were taken in last year's budget, over the next decade we will see an additional $50 billion spent on defence relative to what we inherited when we came to power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have refused to commit to that increase. The shadow minister, in his desperation, is literally saying anything, but, as recently as Sunday, the shadow Treasurer could not have been clearer that the Liberals are refusing to commit to this increase. All the while, the shadow shadow minister, Senator Paterson, is left to be the one who is out there making speeches about Liberal defence policy. They are a mess. They are falling back on their pathetic, tired whimpers that they'll always be the party which spends more on defence, just as they are always the party of lower taxation. But everyone in this chamber knows that it is precisely the opposite which is the case, because, when they last presided over the Treasury bench, they ran a government which grossly underfunded defence. Whether we are talking about guided weapons, increases in Defence Force personnel or more ships, every one of those announcements that they made was underfunded by billions and billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that it is the Albanese Labor government which is delivering a tax cut to every working Australian. It is the Albanese Labor government which has delivered two budget surpluses in a row, and it is the Albanese Labor government which is delivering historic increases in defence spending. The Liberals were big on defence marketing and defence politics, but it is the Albanese Labor government which has committed to doing what it takes to keep Australians safe.</span>

If he doesn't want to trust the member for Farrer, he could wander down to the member for La Trobe, because good old Jase down there was on board—not a lot of sheep in La Trobe.</span>

I thank her also for her tireless advocacy, particularly for the people of Western Sydney in making sure they get the infrastructure they need to ensure that the jobs and liveability of Western Sydney are at the forefront of this government's thinking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, tonight the Treasurer will deliver a budget for every Australian, including when it comes to infrastructure investment—as well as investment and training for our construction workers and retaining our important apprentices in construction. Tonight's budget delivers on the hard work we've undertaken since coming to office to clean up the mess of the decade of what those opposite left us when it came to the infrastructure investment pipeline—the Liberal and National legacy of billions and billions of dollars of underfunded projects and an infrastructure pipeline that would have seen no new infrastructure projects announced in any of their seats, any of our seats or any of the states and territories for at least a decade. That was the legacy left by those opposite when it came to the infrastructure investment pipeline. It's very similar to that left in the infrastructure investment pipeline in defence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been working hard with my state and territory colleagues to identify the priorities for this budget. For many states, that priority has been making sure that we are providing additional funding to actually deliver projects that are in the pipeline. That's why, in Victoria, I was proud to announce we're investing a further $3.25 billion for the North East Link, bringing our contribution up to $5 billion—a project that takes 15,000 trucks a day off suburban roads. I stood there with the Prime Minister. It's a terrific project. </span>

Where the Liberals and Nationals frankly left this important region behind, we are delivering the money that is required to actually deliver on these road projects—not just press releases.</span>

When the budget is handed down by the Treasurer this evening, it will include a budget line labelled 'decisions taken but not yet announced'—billions of dollars to be spent, but we won't know where or on what. As we approach the next election, can you guarantee that your government will not pork barrel these funds to win votes in marginal seats?</span>

If you look at the work that the minister for infrastructure, for example, has done, it's to put integrity back in the system. That's why she did the review and that's why we're out there making positive, constructive nation-building announcements on things that actually matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member refers to decisions taken but not announced. Some of those are, of course, for national security reasons. That's the reason why that's included, and they're often very good reasons why that is the case. And that should always remain the case. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My government is committed to transparency and committed to making sure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, which is why so many of the reforms that it has done are universal. They're not for some people in some seats; they are absolutely universal. An example of that is the doubling of Roads to Recovery funding. Roads to Recovery, in particular, helps councils which are in larger seats—so it tends to help people in regional seats more than urban communities. It's good policy, it makes a difference for local government and it makes a difference for road safety, and it's just one example of us getting the decision-making processes right.</span>

It's a timely question to ask about the decade of cuts and neglect, because yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the famous 2014 budget. I'm sure all of those opposite were out there celebrating—remembering, of course, that, once the thick plumes of smoke from Joe Hockey and Mathias Cormann's famous budget cigars had finally cleared the air around Parliament House, the scale of the cuts to basic government services became clear to every Australian. At its heart was the worst health budget in Australian history, delivered by the worst health minister in the Medicare era. That same health minister had said that there were 'too many free Medicare services', so he tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether. He tried to make every single Australian pay a fee every single time they visited the doctor. He tried to slash public hospital funding by $50 billion and to jack up the price of medicines by up to $5 a script.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to health budgets could not be more different. Our budgets have made medicines cheaper—not dearer but cheaper, saving Australians hundreds of millions of dollars already. We're going to put more funding into our crucial public hospitals, not less—not $50 billion less, like the Leader of the Opposition would have done. And, for Labor, bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare. That's why the centrepiece of last year's budget was a $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive for GP visits. In just the first five months, that has delivered more than 950,000 additional free visits to the doctor. In the member for Bendigo's electorate, the bulk-billing rate for GP visits has climbed by almost eight per cent in just five months, delivering 25,600 additional free visits to the doctor—one of the best results in the country and a reflection of the hard work by the member for Bendigo in trumpeting the benefits of our strengthening Medicare agenda in her electorate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We promised the Australian people that we would strengthen Medicare and we would make medicines cheaper, and we are doing that. In 2013, those opposite promised there would be no cuts to health, and the Leader of the Opposition delivered the exact opposite.</span>

The only people who've argued to stop or pause the live cattle trade in recent times are those opposite. When foot-and-mouth disease was an issue in Indonesia, those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, called for the trade to be stopped, and Murray Watt kept it open. I suggest, just like on live sheep, they should have a discussion in their shadow cabinet on this.</span>

                  </a>  Yes. We're going to have serious consequences if every time someone gets up and raises a point of order, which they're entitled to do under the standing orders, to stop the flow, to stop the answer, to stop the argument, which they're entitled to do, which is disrupting the parliament, to make a legitimate point of order—it is simply not acceptable to then add a remark or add a snide comment at the end. This is the first day back, and it's not going to happen anymore. You raise the point of order. You state specifically what it is without additional remarks or additional comments. I hope everyone's clear on that. On the point of order?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I appreciate your guidance. I would add, though, that the conduct of the House would be assisted if the Prime Minister were able to approach his answer to the questions in a genuine way. The question was very simple. It was put succinctly. It's without ambiguity, and the Prime Minister creates a dynamic in this parliament which is against the spirit that you're trying to enforce, through his obfuscation and his complete refusal to answer the questions as you direct, Mr Speaker.</span>

                  </a>  We have made it very clear. When it comes to the live cattle export trade, that is a trade that we support. That is a trade that we have gone out of our way to support, including personal contact between me and President Widodo and the work that we did with Indonesia to provide significant support to make sure that trade could continue at a time when those opposite were calling for it to be paused. That's what the members of the Liberal Party were doing at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think this is an important trade. It's important to have a big distinction between it and live sheep. When it comes to live sheep, I table the document, which is obviously still on the member for Farrer's website, 'Ending live sheep export can be a win for both animal welfare and business'. It's actually pretty good. It outlines exactly why we have taken the decision that we have, and that was something supported by senior frontbenchers across the board there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the live cattle export industry, it goes far shorter distances and has put in place significant reforms to make sure animal welfare is looked after. That is why we support this industry and will continue to do so. I suggest those opposite should back it in next time too, instead of, at the first opportunity—as they do with every single issue, whether its national security or anything else—always looking for product differentiation, as they did when that issue came up in Indonesia.</span>

The member for Robertson understands the housing challenges in his electorate and, indeed, around the country. He also knows that, after a wasted decade of those opposite, we haven't got enough homes in Australia, and we haven't had enough homes for quite some time. Indeed, we need to build more homes, more quickly, in more parts of the country. That's why we have an ambitious national target to build 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade, from 1 July, through our Homes for Australia plan. We want to slash the red tape, we want to train more tradies and we want to ensure that more Australians have a safe, affordable place to call home. That's why we're backing Homes for Australia with tens of billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been $32 billion in new housing initiatives since we've come to office. They include a new $9.3 billion five-year agreement with the states and territories to help combat homelessness, provide crisis support and build and repair social housing. This includes, importantly, a doubling of Commonwealth homelessness funding every year, to be matched by the states and territories. Homes for Australia also includes a billion dollars in new funding for the states and territories for additional social housing supply and, importantly, for infrastructure needed to deliver more homes, more quickly. We're targeting another billion dollars, of course, in crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children fleeing family violence and for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new funding comes on top of the announcement in the middle of last week, by the Minister for Skills and Training and me, of the $90 million to train more tradies. We need to boost the number of tradies in this country. We need more tradies to build more homes for Australia. This, of course, is part of our plan that includes our Housing Australia Future Fund, our National Housing Accord, our social housing accelerator, our new homes bonus and the Housing Support Program, all designed and targeted so that we can meet the ambitious target of 1.2 million homes right across Australia through our Homes for Australia plan.</span>

Those opposite wasted a decade when they were in government. They made the housing situation worse. They can keep saying no to more housing. We're going to get on with the job, we're going to keep building more homes for Australians that need them, and we're going to train the tradies to build the homes.</span>

She was stabbed by someone coming into the Centrelink office that day. I visited the staff the next day, and I caught up with her and her family by that Friday. Unfortunately, violence against our public servants is not as uncommon as it should be. Last financial year there were 9,000 assaults and acts of aggression. In the first six months of this year there were 6,000, 852 of them serious. There are 10 million Australian visits to Centrelink offices and Medicare offices. There are 6,000 people who work there, and governments have an obligation to keep both the users of the system and the workers safe.</span>

He gave me recommendations within three months. At MYEFO last year, we announced a down payment of $46 million to keep people safe. I'm pleased to advise that in tonight's budget there will be $314 million extra over the next two years. This will lead to 606 extra security guards. There will be improved features of security at the offices that Australians visit. There will be improved liaison capacity with local police if an incident does occur. We'll be establishing, for the first time, a centralised security operations centre, with better CCTV and real-time monitoring of the 318 offices. We're also overhauling 35 of the busiest centres to improve the safety features of those which have the highest traffic.</span>

These are people who are frequently, as we've seen in other situations in Australia, grappling with mental health and other matters. But we need to keep people safe. People have a right to go to work and come home safely.</span>

At the moment, if you assault a judge you receive higher maximum penalties than if you assault a frontline public servant. I'm pleased to say, with the legislation that we have in the House, that if you attack a public servant, an ATO staff member or, indeed, an electorate staff member, there will not be a second-class set of penalties for these people. All people who work for the Commonwealth on the front line will be treated as equally important. This is part of our ongoing system to keep Australians safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do reject plans for nuclear power stations in Australia because they're too slow, too expensive and too risky. We know they're too expensive because they're the most expensive form of power, as study after study has shown. We know they're too risky for Australia because it would put more pressure on ageing coal-fired power stations, which are ageing and less reliable as they break down more and more often, and that is risky for our power system. And we know they are too slow to build. They take decades to build, and almost every nuclear power plant under construction anywhere in the world over recent decades has experienced very significant blowouts in time as well as cost.</span>

The Leader of the Opposition was in Jamisontown on 21 March when he was asked when the opposition would announce their detailed plans for nuclear. He said, 'We'll have more to say about exact locations over the next couple of weeks.' He went on to say, 'We'll provide you with that detail over the next couple of weeks.' Now 'a couple' generally means two, but we'll give it a bit of leeway. That was nine weeks ago.</span>

He made it very clear: 'We are not going be bullied into putting this out on any timeline.' They are not going to be bullied into a time line that they announced. The shadow minister cleared it up. He said, 'People have got to know you're not trying to cover things up; you've just got to be really open.' I'm very glad to hear that.</span>

We've got 3½ hours to go. I'll be waiting, watching the television for the alerts to come out from the Leader of the Opposition as they announce their plan. But if they don't announce the detailed plan today, they have another opportunity on Thursday night.</span>

Thursday is the chance for the Leader of the Opposition to do what he hasn't done in any other budget reply or, to be fair, any other speech, press conference or interview, which is actually announce a detailed policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  The quote was made up. There are two issues here. One is, of course, the budget tonight. The RBA forecast was before the budget. The budget tonight will indicate Treasury forecasts on inflation based upon the policies that we have put in place. One of the things that I have made very clear is that when the Expenditure Review Committee is sat down—unlike what those opposite did in the lead-up to the 2022 budget of former Treasurer Frydenberg, when they just splashed money everywhere, and unlike the declarations about being back in black, when a bunch of mugs held some mugs but that was all that happened—we have made sure that we've put in place the strong measures to produce a budget surplus last year of $22 billion confirmed and a projected budget surplus this year of $9.3 billion. That is what we have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things we have done is to make sure that when we have considered cost-of-living relief we have done it in a way that provides support to people. That's why every single taxpayer will get a tax cut, not just some. That's why we've made sure that the measures that you'll see in tonight's budget are shaped in a way that will not put pressure on inflation—just as previous measures, all of them opposed by those opposite, like our energy price relief plan, have been found to put downward pressure on inflation, and like our cheaper childcare plan and our fee-free TAFE. They are some of the reasons inflation today is half of what we inherited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the test for the Leader of the Opposition is on Thursday night to produce an alternative budget with costings, with policies and with a time frame, saying not just where the expenditure is going to occur but also how they're going to pay for it. They have made a whole lot of comments, including about restoring some tax cuts for very high-income earners back to their old levels. They said they would reverse the measures that we've put in place. The Leader of the Opposition said we should go to an election on it. So Thursday night is his chance to get out of the policy-free zone that he's been in and announce fully costed policies.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his distinguished service. As an Australian, there are very few experiences that could be more humbling than to walk a part of the Kokoda Track, to be in the same place where Australians and Papua New Guineans fought desperately for the same thing at the time, which was home. Last month, in the lead-up to Anzac Day, I had the privilege of walking in the footsteps of giants. I was joined by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, James Marape, who became the first PNG prime minister to walk part of the Kokoda Track. I was joined by the governor of Oro Province, Gary Juffa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We started at Kokoda and we received welcomes at all of the villages that were just as warm as those people familiar with PNG would expect. This friendship between our two nations is about more than geographic proximity. It was cemented literally on the Kokoda Track all those decades ago—a friendship nurtured across generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout our journey, which was a relatively short one, I had the pleasure of meeting many Australians walking the Kokoda Track for the entire journey in what has become a pilgrimage in memory of and respect for those Australians who fought for our country. The landscape is beautiful, but it is challenging, as every member who's walked there knows so well. But at every step you reflect on those who were up against something unimaginably harder. In 1942, 625 Australians were killed along the track. The great artery of mud and suffering and perseverance holds such a special place of such power in Australia's shared memory and, indeed, the memory of PNG. So many Papua New Guineans helped Australians: troops, coastwatchers, shipping pilots, nurses and carers, villagers and stretcher bearers—angels, as they became known, walking tall through the hell of war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this was certainly on my mind when we reached Isurava, the scene of the battle that claimed 99 Australian lives and wounded another 111 Australians. It was a solemn privilege to be there on Anzac Day to utter those important words: lest we forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the ADF personnel and AFP and others who supported the trip. I want to acknowledge the porters who made the expedition possible, especially Bela. I couldn't have done it without him—that's for sure. PNG is our nearest of neighbours. It is an important relationship. We are the closest of friends, and spending that time with Prime Minister Marape was a part of demonstrating what a crucial element that relationship is in peace and stability in our region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I ask all members to note the usual arrangements in place for budget week and, importantly, the courtesies that will apply to the Treasurer's budget speech this evening and equally to the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply on Thursday evening. As with all proceedings of the House, the member with the call is entitled to speak without interruption. In accordance with the precedent, should I determine that a member be required to leave the House under standing order 94(a), the member will be advised by written note. I ask all members to ensure that their guests arrive at the galleries in good time to undertake the secondary security clearance and to be seated by 7.10 pm. I trust there will be cooperation from members and their invited guests in the galleries, for whom they are responsible. It should be the aim of all members that both nights proceed smoothly for the benefit of the House and those Australians watching and listening to proceedings. To finish off: for the information of members, the speech clock will be on, but only as a guide. Standing order 1 provides that there is no time limit for the Treasurer or the Leader of the Opposition for this debate. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The No. 1 priority of any government is to keep the Australian people safe, and what we have seen, time and time again, is the failure of this government to do so. Last week, on Friday, we got the latest data on the government's commitment to keep the Australian community safe after the release of 153 hardened criminals, following the NZYQ case. What that data showed—and it was snuck out under the guise of another decision by the High Court, the ASF17 decision—was that, of the 153 hardened criminals that were released, fewer than half had curfew conditions placed on them and fewer than half had been required to wear an ankle monitor. Do you think we could find out why? No, we could not. We could not find out why—even though there was a commitment given in this place that we would be watching and monitoring and making sure the Australian community were kept safe after those 153 hardened criminals were released into the community—fewer than half had those conditions placed on them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I was in Perth. I went and visited Ninette Simons, and Ninette Simons wanted two questions answered. She wanted to know why one of her alleged attackers was required to wear an ankle bracelet and then that requirement was removed. She also wanted to know why, when bail was given to one of her alleged attackers, it was not opposed by the government. They are two fairly simple, straightforward questions. The one thing that she would like is a response to those questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, as we know, there has been complete and utter radio silence when it comes to any of these questions and many, many more. As a matter of fact, as most members know on this side and as we read, to the frustration of those on the other side, the immigration minister went into hiding. Now the question is: Why did he go into hiding? Did he go into hiding because he has something to hide? I think that is another question that everyone in Australia would like answered, because it seems, whenever the going gets tough, whenever there is a requirement for ministers to front up, this minister just goes missing. There have been reports in the media that there is deep concern on the government side because this has interfered with their ability to get a clear budget message out. I understand their concerns with that, but it just shows you how misdirected their concerns are. Their concerns should be with the safety of the Australian people, not with their own budget message. It shows you once again that failure to keep the Australian community safe and to put the policies and procedures in place to do that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just in relation to the release of those 153 hardened criminals that the Australian community are also getting more and more deeply concerned; there is also the issue of boat arrivals. In the last week we have seen three boat arrivals. In the last six months we have seen six boat arrivals. There are reports today that ABF are holding at sea the people who are on two of those boats while they try to work out what they will do with them. Do we know why? Do we think that the home affairs minister or the immigration minister has been out today, explaining what's taking place at sea? There has been nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, what are the people smugglers thinking? The people smugglers are thinking that we've got a weak prime minister. Had it leaked out on Sunday that the immigration minister would not be in his position come the middle of the year, the people smugglers would have seen an opportunity. We have a weak immigration minister who won't be in his job in a couple of months and a weak prime minister who won't deal front-on with this issue. The Australian people want to know when the Prime Minister and his ministers will front up and start taking these issues seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In question time today we asked the Prime Minister some very simple questions, one of which was: Prime Minister, have you lost control of our borders? Did we get a response? No, we didn't. We followed that with two more questions, one of which was: How many people have drowned at sea since Labor took office? We know, sadly, that the last time Labor were in office we saw people drown at sea. We saw hundreds drown at sea. No-one wants to see that happen again. We don't know whether it's happening again or not. We also do not want to see, in particular, women and children in immigration detention again, and we asked a question of the Prime Minister about that today. Did we get a response from the Prime Minister to those three very simple questions? No, we did not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the problem that we have at the moment: the government is not taking border security seriously. It is not taking seriously keeping the Australian community safe, and the Australian people are worried. Everyone has seen that a growing issue is the concern in the Australian community about their safety on the street. Not in all cases and not in all areas can the federal government reassure the Australian people, but in certain ways it can, and in these two important ways the government is not doing its job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Prime Minister: please, take your No. 1 priority seriously. Please, let's see in the budget a recommitment to putting back the funds that you stripped from Operation Sovereign Borders to make sure that that surveillance on the sea and in the air can take place, because the Australian people want to feel safe again.</span>

If you want to see that, look no further than this headline: 'Libs set free man charged with assault'. This goes to the case, which has been raised by the shadow minister, of the shocking alleged assault of a Perth grandmother in her home. It is one of the NZYQ matters that the opposition has been raving on about for months and blaming the government for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the facts in this matter tell a very different story. The facts in this matter demonstrate the hypocrisy of this opposition when it comes to border security and safety. The person charged with this assault was sent to prison in 2018 for drug possession. These are the facts. In February 2019 his protection visa was cancelled. In June 2019 he was released from jail and transferred to immigration detention, but in January 2020, when the opposition leader was the Minister for Home Affairs, his visa was magically reinstated and he was released from immigration detention. Those opposite go on about the conditions of this person's release. But guess what? When the Leader of the Opposition released this person from immigration detention, do you think he put any conditions on that release? Not one. Do you think that there was any monitoring—ankle bracelets or anything like that? Not at all. Do you think there was any concern for community safety from the then home affairs minister and now Leader of the Opposition? Not at all. This person that was released by the Leader of the Opposition went on to commit further horrific crimes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for home affairs have been banging on about this case for a number of weeks now, seeking to blame the government and to whip up hysteria and fear within the community. Here are some of the quotes that have been used by the Leader of the Opposition to whip up that hysteria:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well, under a Coalition Government, that won't happen. Under a Government I lead, as I demonstrated when I was Minister for Home Affairs, we make the decisions to kick these people out when they've caused harm against Australian citizens. I won't tolerate these people being in our local community …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it turns out that he did tolerate these people being in the local community and he did allow these sorts of crimes to happen. The question that the Leader of the Opposition has to answer is why he released this individual that went on to commit this horrific crime—allegedly. On 3 May 2024, the Leader of the Opposition said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was negligent, reckless, hopeless …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Minister doesn't have responsibility here, I don't know who does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: why didn't you take responsibility when you released this person from immigration detention?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 April 2024—he wasn't done yet—he kept going: 'They're not Australian citizens and they should have been deported. This crime potentially could have been avoided. I don't for the life of me understand why these people are still on the street.' Well, you should know because you put them back on the street when you were the home affairs minister. On 11 May 2024, he went on: 'I don't think he should have been released without wearing an ankle bracelet. Now the minister has to take responsibility for that because they set up this process. We've said if this were us we would take responsibility for it.' It turns out that you didn't take responsibility for it, Leader of the Opposition, and you did release this person with no conditions and no monitoring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 May 2024—and this takes the cake in terms of comebacks—Senator Paterson said, 'Peter Dutton hasn't released hardened criminals into the community.' It turns out that he has and that that quote was not true. So don't come in here and seek to whip up this hysteria about safety in the community and about a threat to safety of Australians due to asylum seekers being released from immigration detention. That was done under your government and it was done by the Leader of the Opposition. That is hypocrisy at its highest order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They make a big thing about protecting borders and being tough on border protection, but the reality is very far from the truth. When it comes to the integrity of Australian borders, we know that the former governments—the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments—had a shocking record and were basically asleep at the wheel. When we came to government we made sure that we did a check of the integrity of our border protection system, in particular our immigration and visa system. There were a number of independent inquiries that were commissioned by the Albanese government. We got esteemed Australians, such as Christine Nixon and Martin Parkinson, to have a look at what was actually going on when it came to border protection, and the findings were shocking. What they found was that under the previous government there was serious and systemic abuse of our migration system that led to serious crimes, including sexual slavery and human trafficking, being committed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nixon inquiry found there was dysfunction and poor management of the immigration system by the former government; in particular, abuse of the visa system. Much of that was occurring when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Home Affairs. It was on his watch. He was the one who was asleep at the wheel and allowing these shocking conditions to persist. We saw abuse of offshore processing, a regime that was basically being used as a slush fund by suspected criminals. There was shocking abuse of contracts—in particular, contracts awarded to allegedly dodgy individuals—under their watch. It was complete abuse of the migration system. Martin Parkinson's review of the migration system found that 'almost a decade of wilful neglect' occurred under the watch of the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the record of the previous government when it comes to border protection and immigration. They ran a system that was dysfunctional and neglectful. They were basically asleep at the wheel. We are putting in place measures to ensure we restore integrity to our migration system and to the protection of our borders. That will take time, because it's a big job to fix the dysfunction of the previous government, but we are making those investments and making sure that we have integrity in our border system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making investments to ensure that we keep Australians safe here in their communities. A big focus of this government is ensuring safer communities for all Australians. We've made some big investments in a safer future for Central Australia, in the wake of some shocking examples of crime in the Northern Territory, with a $250 million investment in programs there. That comes on the back of a $109 million investment in justice reinvestment programs to reduce crime recidivism amongst particular individuals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also ensuring that Australians of all faiths have the opportunity to live and practise their religion free of violence and discrimination, with $50 million for the Securing Faith-Based Places grants program. In the wake of 7 October, those shocking attacks in Israel, we acted by providing $50 million worth of funding for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Muslim community to ensure that they were supporting their communities and running programs to reduce hate, violence and discrimination. Even in the online world many Australians are now being attacked and facing harassment and intimidation. The government are acting to ensure that we keep Australians safe in the online space as well by reviewing Australia's online safety laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a suite of policies aimed at restoring integrity to our migration system, protecting Australia's borders and keeping Australians safe, and ensuring that we keep Australians safe in our communities with all of these programs. We do this through policies, and many more of those will be outlined in the budget tonight. The question for the opposition is this: you talk tough, you come in here with your rhetoric, you seek to point fingers, but where are your policies? Where are the policies that will keep Australians safe in the future? You won't hear anything of that from any of their speakers today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  If Ninette Simons were able to watch this—and I don't know how her eyesight is after that terrible attack on her on 16 April—she'd be very upset. She'd be very disappointed, because what she would see is probably politics at its worst. She would see those on that side blaming us, saying, 'It was their fault.' Australians deserve better. They just deserve better, and they're not getting it at the moment, and Labor is in government. You can't explain it to a 73-year-old Perth grandmother who has cracked lips, who has a bruised forehead and whose face is purple from the bludgeoning that she took on that terrible night when three men arrived at her doorstep pretending to be police officers. They were pretending to be people who the community should be able to trust. That attack should not have been perpetrated. It's just beyond belief that, indeed, it was. People like Mrs Simons deserve better. Labor is in government, and Labor should be doing better. We all should be doing better. We all should bring about policies that protect people like this 73-year-old grandmother, who says that she doesn't feel safe in her own home. When you are in your own home and someone comes to the door and shows a badge and says they are a police officer, in Australia, in 2024, you should be able to believe them. Yet, she's been let down. She's been let down by all of us. She has. And it is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2023, the High Court overturned a 20-year-old precedent which had underpinned the migration policy of governments on both sides. It's just simply not good enough that the High Court—I know we have to separate court and parliament, but it's simply not good enough because we make the rules that they follow, and we should have been onto this earlier. As a parliament, we should have been making sure that detainees who have violent pasts should not have been allowed out into the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember this parliament at its best when we had a case of pins in strawberries. Some maniac was going around putting sharp objects into strawberries. We came together in a bipartisan way and introduced emergency legislation to stop that. Then, we had the situation—I've been here a while—where we had the Russians wanting to build an embassy within the parliamentary triangle, which was far too close to this building. Again, we were at our best when we came together in a bipartisan way to put in legislation which stopped that process and made sure that we put Australians and Australian interests—national security—at the forefront. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to be better than this. We've simply got to be better than this. We hear that we've got another illegal boat arrival. The other side say: 'Well, it's Howard's fault. We put in place measures.' I've got to say that under the Howard government the boats stopped. They started again in the Gillard-Rudd years. When you've got people being washed ashore on Christmas Island—drowned victims of failed policies—we've got to be better than that. As a parliament, we should have been better. We should have pre-empted what the High Court was going to do and come together and put in policies that would have prevented what we're seeing now, and that is detainees out, causing mayhem in our communities. It's simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first job of government is to keep Australians safe. Labor is in power. Labor is in office. Labor is in government, and it's on Labor's watch to do better. If there are good policies, we'll support them. If it means keeping Australians safe, we'll support it. Do better!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  Words spoken in this chamber ricochet around this country, and they tear at our social fabric. A few moments ago, I saw the shadow minister for immigration stand up and discuss a detainee who had been released on an order by the High Court of Australia and how he had breached his monitoring conditions. But that's not exactly what he said. What he chose to do—and it was a choice—was to add the prefix of this man's ethnicity. This man was a Sudanese man. There was no need to introduce this man's ethnicity into the mix, and let me tell you why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what racism looks like. From the moment my skin started to darken, which was when I was a baby—I was born white—racism has stalked me my whole life. But it is much worse for people who do not have the privilege of being in the House of Representatives. It is much worse for marginalised groups in this country, like the Sudanese community, a group of proud Australians who have come to this country to rebuild their lives, fleeing a war which has gone on for decades, which is now classified as a genocide. These people have made significant contributions to our country—people like Nyadol. These people have given back to this country and raised it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read something out to you:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">THIS week, another Sudanese youth was bashed in a racially motivated attack. Kevin Andrews could have been a force for good by appealing to the generosity of spirit within Australians towards the underdog. Instead he has stirred xenophobia and racism. As the Minister for Immigration, he should be building bridges between people, not further marginalising them. A politician in a moment can irreparably damage the reputation of a people and sour any goodwill between them and the broader community, but what recourse do they have against the crushing might of the Federal Government?</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Many African refugees have survived unspeakable suffering that most of us can never really understand only to come to a country and have a federal minister inflict another hell upon them for political gain. Mr Andrews you caused this mess, now fix it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who wrote that? I wrote that. I wrote that in 2007. It was published in a newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>. I've seen this movie before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate demeans this House, and it demeans this nation, which was built off the back of migrants—waves and waves of migrants who have come to this country fleeing wars and conflicts and unspeakable horror, like the Holocaust and genocides in Sudan. These people live and work and walk among us. In fact, one in two Australians were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. In Higgins, that number is 32 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are weaponising this issue, which you know full well was a decision made by the High Court. This parliament scrambled to try and put guardrails around the discharge of these people into the community. We did our level best, and we thank the opposition for working with us. But now you choose—and it is a choice—to weaponise this by demonising and dehumanising asylum seekers. They are people fleeing conflicts. People in my electorate care about that stuff, and so do most Australians. Why? Because we all know immigrants. We all know refugees. We all know people who have rebuilt their lives after fleeing elsewhere and coming here. The tone of who we are as a country is very much laid out in this building and in this chamber. You can choose what complexion that should be. Is it going to be the face of racism and xenophobia? Or is it going to be one of inclusion, warmth and care? That is what I experienced as a child migrant coming to this country. It is what enabled me to thrive, and it is what I see us Australians as.</span>

Over the weekend, it was reported that four more illegal boat arrivals had reached Broome. This marks the fourth time in just six months that illegal boat arrivals have reached the Western Australian coast covering my electorate.</span>

I regularly receive correspondence from constituents of mine saying that they are worried about the enormous risk these arrivals present to northern Western Australia, particularly in terms of safety, public health and biosecurity. I am concerned by the risk of serious diseases entering northern Western Australia through these unauthorised arrivals. If rabies, foot-and-mouth disease or lumpy skin disease was to reach Australia, it would have a devastating impact on our environment as well as our agricultural and pastoral industries. The Prime Minister needs to take this issue seriously before we are crippled with a serious incident, or a return to the large-scale illegal arrivals that occurred under the last Labor government. We simply cannot let that human tragedy happen again. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest arrival, along with others across Australia last week, means that there have now been 17 attempted people-smuggling ventures to reach Australia under the Albanese government. During our time in government, we stopped the boats. We had nine years of safe and secure borders. But now it appears we are in danger of returning to the full-scale people-smuggling operations that took place under the disastrous Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think those opposite would have learned their lesson from their last term in office, which saw 50,000 illegal boat arrivals in a 820 boats, and, tragically, 1,200 deaths at sea. Unfortunately, it is clear that those opposite have learned nothing. Just as Rudd dismantled the Howard government's policy, the Albanese government has undermined Operation Sovereign Borders, which cleaned up the mess they had left us when we came to office in 2013. They have abolished temporary protection visas and are planning a cut of some $400 million in border security funding over the next three years. Incredibly, just as illegal boats are arriving, patrols across north Australian waters are decreasing. Aerial patrol hours have reduced by 20.7 per cent, and maritime patrol days have decreased by 12.2 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you: I'll be paying very close attention to the Treasurer's speech tonight and to the budget papers, to see if their planned cuts will be reversed, and to see if they will be any more resources to defend and patrol northern Western Australia. That is what my constituents are crying out for. The people that I represent deserve nothing less. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government's immigration failures reach much further than reduced patrols or cuts to border security. Their response to the NZYQ ruling of the High Court has been one of the greatest examples of government incompetence on record. Late last year, the government released 152 hardened criminals into the community. This included seven murderers, 37 sex offenders, and 72 people who have committed very serious crimes. This was a mess from the start, with no plan from the government to protect the community from these criminals. There were simply plopped into hotels, right across Australia, and allowed to come and go as they pleased. The minister for immigration and the Minister for Home Affairs need stand up and both take responsibility for the numerous failures that they have overseen. Also front and centre, with regard to community safety, is a growing issue of radicalisation and antisemitism. In recent weeks we've seen two attacks motivated by religious extremism. We've seen the Minister for Education refusing to condemn the 'From the river to the sea' chant and we've seen the government reward international acts of terror at the UN. It is shameful. The foreign affairs minister and the Prime Minister should both hang their heads in shame. The government has made it crystal clear that only the coalition can be trusted to keep our borders secure. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Fact: facts matter. First, Defence officials have confirmed that Operation Sovereign Borders is operating identically to when it came into force in 2013. There's been no change. Every attack by those opposite on Operation Sovereign Borders is an attack on the men and women who are patrolling our borders, who are doing the work to keep this country safe. Fact: Border Force funding is at its highest since it was established, in 2015, and tonight's budget will confirm even more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister started this MPI by saying that a man had been charged for not complying with his monitoring device, and the member for Higgins made the very good point that his ethnicity was unnecessarily mentioned. The fact is: if a man has been charged for not complying with his monitoring device, that shows the system is working as intended. A person has been given a monitoring device. They've allegedly broken the rules and conditions of that monitoring device. Police have charged them with an offence, and they'll now go through the justice process. That's how the system is meant to work. What alternative do those opposite think there is to this? Somebody is given a monitoring device, and then what? The High Court has determined we can't place people in indeterminate detention. The High Court struck down the law that those opposite brought into being. I must say our side defended it and also had it in operation, but it was a law that those opposite brought into being, and the High Court determined the law to be unconstitutional. So the law is working as intended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Facts do matter. The shadow minister and the member for Durack have both referred to 153 'hardened criminals'. That's simply factually wrong, but it is repeated and repeated until people forget that it's wrong. It just gets repeated as if it's fact, and it's not right. Some of those people absolutely are hardened criminals, with very serious charges and very serious convictions, but some of them are not. Not all of those 153 people are hardened criminals, and you shouldn't call a person a hardened criminal if they're not one. Facts matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister says he met Ninette Simons and her husband, Philip, when he went to visit Western Australia. I can tell you: the heart of every member on this side of the House is with that couple. Nobody should have to face what they had to endure—no matter their age, frankly. Clearly an assault occurred. There's an allegation as to who committed the assault, but clearly the couple were attacked. It should not have happened, and our thoughts are with them. It was an appalling attack. But when the shadow minister was in Western Australia did he tell Ninette Simons that one of the men charged with assaulting her had been released into the community—without condition and without monitoring—by the government that he was a member of? The shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been all too happy to run to every microphone they can possibly find to try to pin that appalling alleged attack onto this government because one of the men who's been charged was released as a result of the High Court decision. Almost with glee they've been running to the media to try to do this. But, now that it's been discovered that the other man charged with that alleged assault is somebody they released, there's radio silence from those opposite. It's an appalling politicisation of a terrible incident that should never have occurred. I do agree with the member for Riverina that the couple have been failed by society generally—that in the comfort of their own home this could possibly occur to them.</span>

                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance that's been brought by the member for Wannon, on the government's failure to keep our streets safe and our borders secure, and I thank the honourable member for bringing it. The federal government's first priority must always be to keep its citizens, our community, safe; to keep our streets safe and our borders secure. This government, led by the Prime Minister, with home affairs minister, Minister O'Neil; and immigration minister, Minister Giles, has failed on this most important priority. They have failed Australians as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn particularly to the failure so far on Operation Sovereign Borders. This operation has been repeatedly undermined by this government since it came to power two years ago. It's all very well for members on the other side to be talking about what the coalition may or may not have done, but they have now been in power for two years, and there is the direct evidence we now have that asylum boats have started to return. We've had six boat arrivals now in as many months—six that we know of. This shows again Labor's chronic border failure. We had media reports yesterday that four unauthorised maritime arrivals were found in Broome on Friday. This represents yet another shocking failure of border protection under the Albanese Labor government. It follows recent reports of 33 illegal boat arrivals at Christmas Island and five in Far North Queensland in the last week alone. This is now the 17th—the 17th!—attempted people-smuggling venture to make the journey to Australia under the Albanese government. Again, this is the 17th that we know about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest attempt comes after the Labor government have demonstrably and repeatedly weakened Operation Sovereign Borders. This has happened in three ways: they've abolished temporary protection visas, they've cut funding to border security by over $400 million and they have reduced aerial monitoring and on-sea surveillance by 20 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. How can this be anything but a weakening of what was a solid Operation Sovereign Borders? It's the latest in a cascading set of failures under the current government that have left Australians feeling less safe, less secure and less certain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we turn to the immediate boat arrivals and those that have happened in the past, Labor has a history of weakness on border security. We just have to remember 2007 when, under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the government lost control of Australia's borders. Let us really hope that this Prime Minister is not following the example set by Prime Minister Rudd, because, back then, the Labor government was responsible for, arguably, the greatest humanitarian tragedy and policy failure in modern Australian history. We know that at least 1,200 people, including children, died at sea during that period and that 8,000 children were forcibly placed in detention. This is not something that we want to be returning to, but the asylum seekers are now seeing a weaker government—a government that's weaker on border security and two ministers that are weaker. That is a pull factor. We also have three previous immigration ministers who were part of that weakening: Chris Bowen, Tony Burke and Brendan O'Connor oversaw that humanitarian tragedy, and they're still sitting in cabinet—presumably with influence over the weakening of Operation Sovereign Borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's now turn to NZYQ. Of course Minister Giles has no control over a decision of the High Court. What Minister Giles does have control over is meeting with his department and receiving legal advice about important court cases that are coming up. That would have been far more important than running off to Labor conferences in the UK when the High Court back in June had given an indication that it was likely to find the way that it did. So the minister was on notice, but the minister wasn't responsible; he didn't meet with his bureaucrats and didn't take proper legal advice. A lot of these criminals that have now escaped should have been locked up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Let's just call out this shameful episode for what it is: this is an opposition that is, quite frankly, devoid of ideas, devoid of any kind of policy and devoid of direction. What they are doing is making a pitiful attempt to claw and draw attention to what is an incredibly serious situation. We know that no Australian should ever live in fear in their own home, whether it be from someone who is pretending to be an officer of the law or whether it be someone that they're in an intimate relationship with. It is awful to see a woman on the television with a face blackened and bruised. The only thing that is worse than that is watching an opposition make hay from it in the media. It is truly despicable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that it is again being brought up in parliament as a matter of public importance today, to try and make political points, really is the nub of this matter today. I only have to look across the chamber and see barely a handful of people here. If this opposition were so hell-bent on drawing attention to this matter of public importance they would all be here, but they aren't. The issue is this: they love nothing more than to light a flame under a pool of fear and watch the flames rise, because they know that when Australians are worried and nervous it somehow draws power to them. Let me say that the contributions of people like the member for Higgins, who spoke today, are in complete contrast to that argument. She gave calming words and said, 'Australia can be better and bigger than the xenophobic, paltry debate that we've heard from those opposite today.' It truly belittles us as a country when people try to score politically from things that aren't good but should be treated with so much more strength and dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the members newly elected on the other side: when they speak about our government and what we've done, know that we have been in government for two years and we have not abolished any of the Border Force protections they proclaim that we have. In their term of government, when boats arrived—and they did—we didn't hear about them; they were conveniently described as 'on-water matters' and never spoken of. Those opposite weren't transparent, and somehow, by the cover of darkness and deceit, they thought they were getting away with it. Well, they weren't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need to remember that when we came to government we had to deal with a backlog of one million immigration applications. There was so much work that had just been left undone or ignored. Quite frankly, they don't really care about keeping our borders secure. What they care about is their own positions of power. By setting off fear in the Australian public, they perceive that they can keep that power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're not fearmongering. We're over here responsibly and diligently setting the policy, doing the work and working within the parameters of the law. Incidentally, some of the laws those opposite put in place have been found wanting by the High Court. What we are doing here is providing sensible, stable government. We know there are challenges. We know there is difficulty. Many parts of the world are in a perilous state. People do seek asylum, and it is challenging and difficult. But, rather than just trying to create this smog of fear, we are diligently and responsibly working through the challenges that we face. We are doing our best, and our best is so much better than anything those opposite could ever offer. I say to the Australian people: it isn't easy, but we are working hard for you and we are keeping you safe. We want Australia to be a safe and secure nation.</span>

And I want to acknowledge the fine contributions made by members of the coalition on this matter today. It has been a long-held tradition that the MPI is a topic that the opposition brings to the House for debate and consideration. At the fundamental core of this debate is trust. It's the same trust a child has when looking for safety—that trust they have in their parent. It's the same trust that should exist with the Australian public in their government—that trust that exists when it comes to keeping their streets and borders safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But on too many unfortunate occasions we have seen this government, time and time and time again, erode that trust of the Australian public—that trust that should be lock fast, that trust that should allow them to sleep of a night without fear of their home being invaded. That trust is paramount to this debate. That trust was eroded on 200 occasions when this government indicated that they would give a $275 electricity cut. That's when the trust started to be chipped away. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUCHHOLZ:</span>
                  </a>  Can I just take that interjection? Those on the other side, since I've been in the chamber, were not interrupted once by a member of this coalition. And I'm talking about trust that the Australian public should have in those on the other side. I can understand why they take umbrage, the member who interrupted, that person on the other side—they are who they should least trust. We had a cost-of-living crisis whereby on 13 occasions the Australian public could not trust this government. Then we saw that we couldn't trust this government when there was a $450 million spend on a referendum where not one state responded positively to what the government were asking the public to put their faith in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, closer to this debate: trust was betrayed when the 300 detainees were let out. Rightly, there was a comment from those on the other side about not all of those detainees being hard-core criminals. But there were seven murderers, and there were 37 sex offenders, and there were 72 violent offenders, of the 149 that were released on that charter. Not all were hardened criminals, but we don't put our best and brightest into detention centres. That's the fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard those on the other side talk about—or feign indignation at—racism. This is not a debate about racism. This is a debate about whether the Australian public should feel safe, and they don't; they do not feel safe. There have been 17 boat arrivals since this government came into office. Each time one of those boats arrives the Australian public's trust in this government is eroded—and it should, rightly, be eroded. That's because this government has signalled to the people smugglers that the Australian Labor Party is open for business for them. The Australian public will have their opportunity to square it up on border security at the next election in terms of whose policies worked and whose failed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a comment from the other side, from the last speaker, that we are 'devoid of ideas'. Well, let me paint a policy position in the mindset of the Australian Labor Party—an idea that worked extremely well for us when we were in government, and that was a campaign to stop the boats. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  Well, we find those opposite doing what they do best, especially when it comes to their nine long years in government. We're seeing another attempt by those opposite at lulling themselves into a false sense of security when it comes to their record. Leading those opposite into this trance-like state of cognitive dissonance was, of course, the member for Wannon. Their constant demonstrations of historical revisionism in this place are effectively an ironclad guarantee that they are doomed to repeat each and every mistake—and I say the word 'mistake' quite charitably as an exercise in restraint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is curious that the member is leading the MPI for those opposite today. You would think the member for Dickson would use every opportunity to cosplay as a strongman. In the same way, his love of secrecy as a minister allowed him to spend many years at the cabinet table flying under the radar, cosplaying as competent during the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison Liberal governments—the grand architect of many small and large mistakes. Many of those have already been disinfected by the sunlight of a government that believes in transparency and accountability. I'm sure the best is yet to come! Watch this space! The moment he showed the Australian people he could smile when those pearly whites were out on display after he resigned from the final Turnbull cabinet must have all been an act. If this weren't the case, we wouldn't be continuing to uncover and correct the litany of mistakes made under the Dutton regime, particularly through his time as Minister for Home Affairs. I'm sure he will brush aside any and all kinds of criticism like this, but I know that deep down that glistening smile he has in his wheelhouse turns upside down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time limits placed on MPI debate speeches make it quite hard to provide granular detail on the worst of the worst or even to have enough time to put the member for Dickson's legacy into a BuzzFeed style list. But I will name just a few examples of the member for Dickson's direct contributions to national security and a safe and cohesive society. We will start with some of the more recent examples and, time permitting, move on to dessert.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first example was the review handed down by former Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police Christine Nixon AO, into the abuses of Australia's visa system. Another review was conducted by former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson, whose assessment of his and his government's job of protecting our borders is 'almost a decade of wilful neglect'. We also had the review conducted by former director-general of ASIO Dennis Richardson, whom those opposite probably describe as a big lefty as a result of the report. What the review found to have occurred on our borders under the Leader of the Opposition's watch borders on horrifying: giving contracts to companies whose leadership were involved in everything under the sun, from bribery to drug smuggling, arms trafficking, money laundering and even attempting to avoid US sanctions in place against the Iranian government. I can certainly sympathise with the latter. I'm sure all of us here try to avoid US sanctions on Iran, although this is mostly accomplished by not having any personal or business dealings with high-ranking Iranian officials. I'm sure those opposite believe that all these things make up the secret sauce of keeping Australia safe and secure. They believe that to defeat a criminal you have to think like one. The Department of Home Affairs under the Leader of the Opposition's watch certainly assembled the Avengers, paying them handsomely. I'm sure they all appreciated getting something close to, by their standards, an honest day's work. The Leader of the Opposition's record on border security is a lot like the TV show <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandal</span>: you can expect at least a scandal every episode. Sadly, that show ended years ago, but, thankfully, the opposition leader's time as a minister and a member of the National Security Committee of Cabinet did as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the Albanese Labor government has invested millions more into national security and protecting our borders compared to the time in government of those opposite, not that long ago. Those opposite will pretend to hear the Treasurer deliver his budget address later tonight, but they will still thump their chests and deny these self-evident facts. No wonder those opposite want to see a nuclear Australia. They need something to distract geiger counters stuck in the same room as the opposition leader.</span>

The amended subsection 92(1) provides a defence where the ASIO identities were published with the written consent of the minister or of the Director-General of Security. The burden of proof for this defence is considered to be reversed in the existing section and is now explicitly reversed in the proposed amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The publishing of ASIO identities has a very real prospect of resulting in harm to ASIO staff and affiliates, and it should only be done with the absolute greatest of care. In the 75-year history of ASIO it's only been done a handful of times. My view is that if an individual who has published ASIO identities has received the written required consent it is entirely reasonable to expect them to be able to produce that consent when required. I've provided to the scrutiny of bills committee my response, which contains additional information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill reflects the government's commitment to the security of our society and our country and to ensuring the legislation that underpins the actions of the national intelligence community is robust. I commend the bill to the chamber. I would like to provide to the parliament an addendum to the explanatory memorandum which I referred to in my second reading speech.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300124" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  The fabric of our society fundamentally shifted the day TCN9 in Sydney began testing their broadcast television transmissions, on 16 September 1956. It would take them just six weeks to begin officially broadcasting, on 27 October that same year. HSV7 in Melbourne followed quickly, broadcasting to viewers on 4 November 1956. That was followed by ABV2, and then GTV9 on 19 January 1957. For many years, however, ownership of a television set was rare, with a 23-inch black-and-white TV expected to cost around 6,000 pounds in the 1960s, or half of the then average income of 12,400 pounds. Regardless, by the time commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module <span style="font-style:italic;">Eagle</span> on the moon's surface on 20 July 1969, the world had become accustomed to gathering around the box both to be entertained and to see the news for themselves. It is not an understatement to say that, since then, many of the most important events of our times have been witnessed directly thanks to these free broadcasting services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have very personal memories of the transition from radio to television, with some of my earliest recollections being of hearing the show <span style="font-style:italic;">Dad and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Dave</span> on the radio as my parents listened to it in the morning. Whilst the radio stayed on over breakfast, our family routine quickly expanded to include a gathering around the old black-and-white TV to watch the rugby league on a Saturday afternoon. The quality of broadcast was not always universal, and I remember the time we spent with my Aunty Sis in Broken Hill and watching her television screen, which was covered in red cellophane in the hope that it would somehow make the grainy grey snowstorm image behind it decipherable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1975 something extraordinary happened. Those images, which had previously only been seen in black and white, exploded in colour. Many kids, including myself and my siblings, were hooked. In the 50-odd years since, the quality and style of broadcast has become unrecognisable from those early days, with my kids rarely sitting down in front of an actual television set to watch anything. Rather, their laptops, their phones, their iPads and other personal devices have become their key point of consumption, and that brings us to the legislation in front of the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The channels through which broadcasts are delivered have evolved, as have the players in the field of content provision. Where once geographical distances restricted what could be viewed and where, images and content now stream around our planet on a constant basis. In this context, I believe the Communications Legislation Amendment (Prominence and Anti-siphoning) Bill 2023 is an important piece of legislation as it protects the public interest and ensures Australians can continue to access free programming on their TVs. However, I would argue that it could be strengthened in a number of ways, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. These include retrospectively applying the prominence framework to existing TV sets; extending the prominence requirements to search functions; extending the protections afforded by the antisiphoning scheme to prevent not only subscription broadcast services but also subscription streaming services from acquiring rights ahead of free-to-air broadcasters; and reducing the time frame for this legislation to take effect to 12 months from the passing of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the interests, laws and players that govern what people see on their TVs and when they see it have not really drawn a lot of public attention. Rather, people have continued to consume their programming in a way that fits their lives with little regard to how that content is being dished up to them or who is responsible not only for its production but for putting it within their line of sight. Again, my experience here is personal. For me as a child, my time in front of the television was limited and it was dominated by Australian created content, which was mainly educational in purpose. It was <span style="font-style:italic;">Play Sc</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hool</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Romper Room</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr Squiggle</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Skippy</span>, with cartoons such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Scooby</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Doo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Looney Tunes</span> providing the animated content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast-forward to my own children, and kids' content had expanded to a deafening roar, streamed 24/7 and available on a multitude of devices. It was <span style="font-style:italic;">iCarly</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Teletubbies</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">In </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the Night Garden</span>, Thomas the Tank Engine, <span style="font-style:italic;">Brum</span>, and the difference was brought into stark contrast for me when I observed my beautiful four-year-old daughter making videos on my iPhone in which she spoke with an American accent. It seemed her consumption of Nickelodeon had taught her that the drawl that comes with being American was standard when it came to entertainment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As anyone who knows me will tell you, I'm a fierce defender of human rights. By respecting everyone's human rights, I believe we create a society that is fairer, where all are treated equally and all have a responsibility for their own actions. So it may seem at odds with who I am to be standing here and speaking in support of this legislation today, as some have criticised it as a veiled attempt by the government to control what the population consumes by way of broadcast content. But I see this legislation differently. I see it as a protection mechanism to ensure that, as the content-streaming world explodes globally, our Australian culture and our right to free-to-air content are not lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Free-to-air TV broadcasters provide services in the public interest, from news programs to local stories and children's shows which reflect Australia's evolving national personality. Why should an entertainment organisation not based in our country, nor committed to our values, be able to position itself ahead of our free-to-air channels? Why should people who purchase a new television made overseas be offered content that is only available behind a paywall as the first option when they start their new television? Surely it's only fair that the content already produced here and available free of charge should be front and centre, and easy to find. This bill seeks to implement a public policy of ensuring that Australians can access coverage of culturally significant news and events on television for free. It seeks to ensure widespread access to information regarding local issues and events, and thus enables Australians to participate in public debate and democratic decision-making. It introduces a prominence framework which sets minimum requirements that manufacturers of internet-connected televisions and television-like devices must meet regarding the accessibility of free-to-air television content, ensuring Australian television channels are prominently displayed on new devices. It also amends and modernises the existing antisiphoning scheme to address the risk of significant sporting events migrating behind paywalls on online streaming platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an era dominated by the rapid spread of mis- and disinformation, and at a time when the cost-of-living pressure on all Australians is evident, this is exactly the type of legislation our government should be introducing. In reviewing the legislation, I concur with others that the fact it increases the likelihood of events being broadcast for free is a really good thing. I understand the arguments that this benefit is at the cost of other media content providers—and, potentially, sporting organisations themselves—but I'm comfortable that the public benefit and public need outweigh these concerns. Even as an event is broadcast through free-to-air, the availability of that broadcast confers a financial benefit to the free-to-air channel which, in turn, can be sold by them to commercial partners. The circle of investment therefore should continue to flow. Giving free-to-air broadcasters the first shot does not give them the right to lowball a potential partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also do not shy away from saying that which is produced locally and costs nothing to consume should be given priority on all home screens for all viewing devices, both new and existing. I understand that the real estate on those devices is valuable to those who manufacture them, and I understand that these manufacturers want to reap these potential commercial benefits. But, from my perspective, the establishment of that market should not be the result of the incursion of ongoing and unnecessary expenses for Australian consumers, so I wholeheartedly support the prominence framework suggested in this bill. I also support calls for the onus of carrying local contents apps to be placed on the manufacturers, rather than on the free-to-air broadcast providers as, ultimately, if you wish to bring it to Australia then I believe you should meet our standards and our nation's needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a step in the right direction for Australia's prominence and antisiphoning framework, but I do believe it could be strengthened significantly to protect the public interest and to ensure that Australians can continue to access free programming on their televisions. Firstly, the government could consider expanding the prominence provisions of this legislation to cover existing sets. Sets are updated regularly over the air by the TV platforms and set manufacturers, making retrospective applications of these provisions technically possible. Without applying the prominence rules to existing sets retrospectively, it will take an excessively long time for these changes to have any real impact. In that time, literally thousands of Australians could end up paying for content that is in fact free elsewhere. As such, both existing devices and newly supplied devices that fall within the definition of 'regulated television device' should be subject to the new prominence regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I believe the scheme should also regulate prominence within search results. Right now, if you search for a program that is available on free-to-air TV by using your smart TV search function, the free version won't necessarily be the first search result you see. In fact, you might not even know the program is available for free because there is no requirement to feature free-to-air content prominently in the search function. This could be fixed by extending the prominence requirements to search functions, and I urge the government to consider this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, to ensure smart TV apps can access free Aussie sport, the antisiphoning provisions should be extended to cover both terrestrial broadcasts and free streaming rights. Anyone who has moved into an apartment built in the last five years in North Sydney will not have access to an aerial and so will need to watch free-to-air sport services via streaming, yet the bill currently only protects aerial-delivered broadcast rights. Changes in technology mean the antisiphoning scheme, which is long past due, should be expanded to ensure Australians are not required to pay for a plethora of subscriptions and services to watch iconic sporting events. To achieve this, free-to-air broadcasters should be afforded priority in acquiring not only the rights to broadcast listed sporting events on TV but also the rights to retransmit that content on their free on-demand broadcast services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would make one last appeal of the government, which I will be moving an amendment on—that is, to shorten the time for these provisions to come into effect. As it stands, manufacturers will have 18 months to implement this transition, after which they will be required to ensure the prominence obligations have been met. However, manufacturers have been aware this change was coming for some time now, and experts have suggested the prominence requirements for manufacturers could be implemented within six months. This is not a hardware issue, with much of the prominence cases controlled by software—and, as we all know, software updates happen frequently and seamlessly. During the Senate inquiry into this bill, experts may declare many of the changes required could be made effectively within days through a server update, and it should be possible for manufacturers to manage the software switch within six months and certainly within the 12-month time frame recommended by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this, I then asked, 'Why delay?' To leave it for 18 months is to see thousands of Australians potentially subscribe to a service they do not need, as the content they are searching for is already available for free on an existing Australian free-to-air network. In the next 18 months, there will be elections in the United States, in Canada and at home, and Australians should expect to have easy access to impartial, localised news coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those that argue against this legislation, saying it is anticompetitive or an attempt by our government to control what our population views, I say, 'Tell them they're dreaming.' Australians would be the first to yell, 'Not happy, Jan', if they realised they had been led to pay for something they could otherwise have seen for free. So let's get this legislation right and let's get it done now. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I thank honourable members who contributed to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Prominence and Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2023. This important legislation was introduced by the Albanese government because we want all Australians, regardless of where they live or what they earn, to be able to access free, high-quality and diverse media services and programs, including sports, that reflect our unique perspectives and identity as a nation, and we want our homegrown media entities to be able to compete on a level playing field. The measures contained in this bill support those outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly acknowledge and thank the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee members for their consideration of the bill, and the stakeholders that contributed to the process. The committee inquiry was comprehensive and provided the opportunity for all interested parties to outline their views on the bill along with the draft prominence regulations and the draft antisiphoning list, which were released to assist the inquiry. The Albanese government has carefully considered the views raised through the inquiry and the recommendations made by the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now provide the government's response to the recommendations and proposals raised through this process. The committee recommended that the antisiphoning provisions be passed and that the prominence provisions be passed subject to five specific recommendations. Its first recommendation was that the minister for communications and the Australian Communications and Media Authority consider options for a phased approach to the prominence framework and/or a reduction to a 12-month time frame. The government supports this recommendation and has carefully considered options for the phased introduction of the prominence framework and the potential to reduce the application time frame to 12 months but has not adopted this approach for a number of important reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The prominence framework is novel in Australia and remains a relatively novel intervention in overseas markets. This dictates a relatively prudent approach to the commencement of any new regulations. The television device market is global and involves long lead times for the design, development, manufacture and distribution of devices. In the interests of Australian consumers, elected representatives should avoid passing laws that may result in manufacturers withdrawing from the Australian market or offering a more limited range of devices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There also needs to be a period of time for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to establish the operative and detailed elements of the framework, including in relation to the devices to be regulated and the description and requirements of the primary user interface used on these devices. The 18-month application period specified in the bill seeks to accommodate these factors and to strike a balance, delivering a meaningful prominence outcome without unduly impacting on manufacturers or giving rise to unwanted outcomes. The government does not intend to make any amendments to this timing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its second recommendation, the committee recommended that the Minister for Communications and the department prioritise the implementation of radio prominence on devices such smart speakers. The government supports the committee's recommendation in principle. The principle that Australians should be able to easily access local services holds equally true for radio as it does for television. Radio services play a crucial and unique role in keeping Australians informed and entertained, particularly in remote and regional areas of the country. However, although there are some parallels between radio and television in relation to prominence, there are also a number of important differences in terms of technology interfaces and consumers' needs and expectations. It is important that we consult fully on any potential regulation for radio prominence and seek views from consumers and the sectors that may be affected. The government is preparing a consultation paper on radio prominence that will be released shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third recommendation of the committee's inquiry report focused on the regulation of online services provided by free-to-air broadcasters. The committee recommended that the Minister for Communications amend the bill to extend free-to-air codes of practice to online services. The government notes this recommendation but will not need to amend the bill as envisaged by the committee. However, the government recognises the need for reform in this area. There are clear gaps and imbalances in the regulatory framework applying to media content services in Australia. Traditional broadcasting services—television and radio—remain heavily regulated, while streaming video-on-demand services, including those provided by the broadcasters themselves, are subject to little if any regulation. This imbalance is something that the government intends to address as part of its broader media reform program, but this is not something that can be done easily or quickly through an amendment to this bill. Doing so would significantly delay the passage of the bill and withhold the benefits that the prominence and antisiphoning measures will deliver for Australian consumers and industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's fourth recommendation was that the Minister for Communications, on advice from the department, amend the bill to allow the review of the prominence framework to be conducted within two years of implementation, as necessitated by rapid technological change. The government supports this recommendation in principle. The Senate committee inquiry highlighted the rapid and accelerating rate of change in media markets. While we need to allow time for these new regulatory arrangements to be bedded down, it is also vital to assess their impacts and effectiveness when feasible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth recommendation of the committee was that the Minister for Communications consider, either before or as part of the prominence framework review, other related reforms in the industry to reflect the growing role of the internet, online service provision and consumer behaviour. The government supports this recommendation in principle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined earlier, the government is committed to a program of work to modernise media regulations and fulfil the legitimate expectations of consumers and industry for consistency, transparency and equity in our regulatory environment. A key focus of our media reform program will be to calibrate our regulatory and policy settings to harness the benefits of online media, while ensuring that consumers are adequately protected from potential harms and that key policy outcomes continue to be delivered. The government will be progressing various streams of work to support this outcome over the coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other notable issues were raised in the inquiry process and have been carefully considered by government. One such issue is the question of whether the prominence framework should explicitly exclude gaming consoles. The government is supportive of including a reference to gaming consoles in the revised explanatory memorandum as a type of device that is unlikely to be designed for the primary purpose of facilitating the viewing of audiovisual content. However, this shouldn't be codified in the bill, as the framework needs to retain the flexibility to accommodate changes in the role and intended purposes of devices over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another significant issue is the question of whether to extend the antisiphoning scheme to prevent the acquisition of any right until a free-to-air broadcaster has both a broadcast and a BVOD right. The government does not support extension in this manner and acknowledges the concern around this issue as well as the need to balance other considerations, such as the interests of other media services and the financial sustainability of Australia's sporting codes. The government is mindful that evidence of recent rights deals shows that where a free-to-air broadcaster has acquired a broadcast right they have also successfully secured online rights for their BVOD service in many instances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is a key component in the government's overall media reform program. These reforms will support a media sector that keeps us informed, reflects our diverse cultures and perspectives, upholds and respects community standards and provides equitable access to services for all Australians, irrespective of where they live or what they earn. I call on members to support the bill.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 17 (line 14), omit "18 months", substitute "12 months".</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Schedule 1, item 24, page 24 (line 7), omit "18 months", substitute "12 months".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments I'm moving today would shorten the timeframe for the prominence provisions to come into effect to 12 months after the bill passes. As the bill currently stands, manufacturers would have an 18-month transition period, after which they would be required to ensure that their prominence obligations have been met. Having reviewed the views of many stakeholders, the submissions made to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the recommendations of that committee, I believe it is both appropriate and feasible to fast-track the prominence provisions. Specifically, the Senate committee, after thoroughly examining this legislation, recommended:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Minister for Communications and the Australian Communications and Media Authority consider options for a phased approach to the proposed prominence framework and or a reduction to a 12-month timeframe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturers have been aware of the proposed prominence obligations for some time now, giving them time to consider necessary preparations. Additionally, many of the changes necessary to meet the prominence provisions are controlled by software rather than hardware. So, while many of the manufacturers will be meeting the needs of the global marketplace, the truth is that the software is tailored to where the device is landing. As we all know, software updates happen at a sometimes frightening and frequent pace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate inquiry into this bill, experts made it clear that many of the changes required could be made, effectively, overnight through a server update. In fact, some experts have suggested that the prominence requirements for manufacturers could be implemented within six months—six months sooner than the amendment that I am moving actually proposes. But, given the Senate committee's recommendation and given everything that I have heard, my amendments propose that the timeframe be shortened from 18 months to 12 months, because the truth is this: for every month that we delay, we risk Australians paying for content that is actually otherwise available to them free of charge because we simply don't have the prominence framework right in this nation.</span>

I note that the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee recommended that the government consider options for a phased approach to the proposed prominence framework and/or a reduction to a 12-month timeframe. I have given this recommendation close consideration. I remain of the view that the 18-month period in the bill strikes a balance between a range of factors. Firstly, the prominence framework is novel, and an 18-month implementation timeframe is a prudent approach to the commencement of any new regulations. Secondly, the bill interacts with global manufacturing and distribution supply chains, with long lead times involved in the design, development, manufacture and distribution of devices. Manufacturers need a reasonable timeframe to adjust to the new framework. Thirdly, there needs to be a realistic period of time for the regulator, the ACMA, to establish the operative and detailed elements of the framework. This market is evolving rapidly, and connected TV devices are not homogenous. For these reasons, the government will oppose this amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I noted during the second reading debate, this is an important piece of legislation, and it's important that we get it right. The inquiry conducted by the Senate committee has enabled the bill to be carefully considered. The government's amendments will address a number of issues raised through the inquiry process, clarify the operation of certain provisions, tighten definitions and bring forward the statutory reviews of the two regimes. The first three amendments relate to the prominence framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (1) will clarify the definition of a regulated television service to make it clear that broadcasting video on demand, or BVOD, applications that are afforded prominence under the framework are those that are provided by the free-to-air broadcasters or other entities specified by the minister. This amendment will ensure that prominence is not inadvertently given to applications that happen to provide access to a regulated BVOD service but are provided by another party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (2) will tighten the definition of the primary user interface, which is the part of a regulated television device on which free-to-air broadcasting services need to be made available. The bill as introduced provides a flexible definition of 'primary user interface' to accommodate the fact that these interfaces are not homogeneous and vary between devices. However, the current reference to BVOD services in the definition means that a manufacturer of a regulated television device would not be prevented from placing free-to-air BVOD services on a separate and lower tier of the primary user interface, compared to other audiovisual services such as paid subscription based streaming services. The proposed amendment would address this risk and ensure that free-to-air broadcasting services are treated no less favourably than comparable services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (3) will bring forward the timing of the review of the prominence framework to commence as soon as practicable after the end of two years from commencement and application of the new arrangements, rather than three years as in the bill as introduced. The committee inquiry process highlighted the rapid technological and consumer changes that are occurring in the television market, and this amendment will enable these developments and the operation of the new framework to be assessed at an earlier point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final two amendments relate to antisiphoning. Amendment (4) will reduce the time before events are automatically removed or delisted from the antisiphoning list from 12 to six months. The increase in this period from six to 12 months in the bill as introduced was intended to bring the delisting period in line with the commercial reality of media rights acquisition, where media rights deals are typically settled more than a year in advance of the event taking place. However, through the committee inquiry process, the concern was raised that extending the delisting period may lead to protracted rights negotiations and put at risk the ability of Australians to see sport for free. The amendment will address this risk and retain the current six-month delisting period as it is under the current scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (5) will bring forward the timing of the review of the antisiphoning regime to as soon as practicable after the end of two years from the commencement of the new arrangements, down from a five-year period in the bill as introduced. Expediting the time frame for the review will enable these developments to be considered at an earlier point, while affording sufficient time to assess the operation of the new arrangements and the impacts on industry and consumers.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—Australia is a leading participant in international trade. Continuing to trade with the world will be essential to generate new and diversified trade and investment opportunities for Australian businesses. An open approach to trade is fundamental to the success of many Australian industries, including supporting one in four Australian jobs. Our network of trade agreements breaks down the barriers, fostering secure and well-paying job. Trade contributes to 31 per cent of our economy, enhancing resilience and raising living standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In undertaking this inquiry, the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth observed that the Australian government's approach to negotiating trade and investment agreements has largely served Australians well over many decades. However, it was evident that we must continue to adapt and improve our approach so that we can ensure that our participation in international trade is of the greatest benefit to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry into the Australian government's approach to negotiating trade and investment agreements was adopted on 9 August 2023, following a referral from Minister Don Farrell, the Minister for Trade and Tourism, and the final report was completed on 29 April 2024. We had 54 written submissions, which were received from businesses, industry groups, unions, associations, government agencies, community groups and academics. Eight public hearings were held across the nation, in Canberra and Melbourne and virtually as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the inquiry, the committee was particularly drawn to evidence emphasising the need to better ensure that trade agreements are genuinely within the national interest—that is, providing an overall net benefit to Australia rather than benefits only to certain interests or particular sectors. While trade brings substantial benefits to many Australians, it has the potential to have widespread impacts, with some experiencing costs and being disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investor-state dispute settlement clauses are some of those things which were contained within our trade agreements, and we'll actively engage in processes to reform existing ISDS mechanisms. Our approach has been to include rules in trade agreements that maintain Australia's high labour standards and give Australian workers a fair go. We understand the importance of ensuring that trade commitments do not unduly weaken domestic policy objectives or the ability of the Australian government to make decisions in the interests of its citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is of the view that more robust processes to identify the potential impacts of trade agreements would be highly valuable. To this end, there should be comprehensive, in-depth and independent modelling and analysis as well as wider assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts to determine whether trade agreements are in the national interest overall. Such impact assessments should consider the implications of Australia's trade commitments in areas such as health, gender, labour and human rights, as well as for regional communities and First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, to facilitate enduring benefits of trade for Australia, it is also imperative that the national interest is not a one-off assessment. Rather, it must be re-examined using real-world experience as part of the practice for regular review or agreements. Robust processes for determining the national interest are vital to ensuring that public confidence is maintained. We want to work in Australia's best interests when following through our commitment to open international trade. This remains more important than ever in the face of significant challenges arising in the global trade environment over recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report makes eight recommendations to strengthen Australia's approach to negotiating trade and investment agreements, including by undertaking independent modelling and analysis of each proposed or under-review agreement; establishing a consistent approach to evaluating agreements, including conducting broader assessments of economic, social and environmental impacts; seeking to include human rights, labour and environmental chapters in agreements that, where appropriate, contain specific references to relevant international standards; seeking to not include provisions in agreements that waive labour-market and skills-testing requirements or investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, provisions; pursuing the inclusion of provisions in agreements that protect and promote First Nations intellectual property; and establishing a legislative framework to guide some elements of the negotiation of trade and investment agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's final report builds on its interim report, which was published earlier this year and made five recommendations, including transparency, accountability and oversight in the process for negotiating Australia's trade and investment agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all the businesses, union groups, industry bodies, government agencies including DFAT, community groups and academics that provided the written submissions and appeared at our public hearings throughout the inquiry. I'd also like to thank the secretariat for their hard work on this inquiry, and, of course, I'd like to thank my fellow committee members: the deputy chair, the member for Wright; the member for Lyne, who's here as well; and other members who participated. I'd also like to thank all the witnesses that appeared before the committee. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2024-25. I thank the member for Solomon for being so deeply interested in this topic that he has promised to stay for the entire statement, which is a credit to the House!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present this statement on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, or the PBO. The committee is required under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to consider the draft budget estimates of the ANAO and the PBO, respectively, and to make recommendations to both houses of parliament regarding these estimates. This required statement on behalf of the committee is in advance of the budget being handed down and is an important transparency measure that informs the parliament and the public on the adequacy of the ANAO's and the PBO's resourcing. The committee considers both offices vital in supporting the work of this parliament and in strengthening integrity and transparency in public administration. I was counting today: this is actually the ninth time I've delivered this statement, which is a testament to how well my parliamentary career is going! We'll aim for 10!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has carefully scrutinised the ANAO's and the PBO's draft budget estimates and has resolved to endorse them subject to further review of the costings and final estimates, which may be agreed with the Department of Finance. The ANAO received supplementations in both the 2021-22 and 2023-24 budgets to deal with acute cost pressures, but it is not requesting any additional funding in this budget. As outlined in its budget submission to the committee, however, the ANAO will require funding in future years if it is to meet both its legislative requirements and its other outputs under the present framework. This is due primarily to the cumulative impact of the efficiency dividend which currently applies to the ANAO. I would just say that the committee has resolved—and this will take a few minutes, but we have a few minutes—to fulfil our legislative requirement and make some detailed comments on this for the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years, over successive parliamentary terms, the committee has been grappling with the sustainability of the ANAO's long-term financial position and the risk arising to its operational independence and ability to perform its vital statutory roles at an appropriate level of output. In plain English: I'm a Victorian and I lived through the 1990s. I saw what happened when the then Kennett government effectively tried to nobble their then auditor-general by slashing the budget. That's what these mechanisms in the Commonwealth legislation aim to avoid. For the coming financial year, though, the ANAO can draw on accumulated reserves to meet its resourcing requirements. However, it has become clear to the committee, in discussions over many months regarding the ANAO's funding models and protections, that its current financing model is not sustainable over the long term. The ANAO is a relatively small agency and has a legislative mandate to undertake financial statement auditing—that's mandatory—alongside a set of other agreed outputs. Notable of those are performance audits, which are the things which attract the most public attention, and, more recently, a new third limb, if you like, in auditing the performance statement auditing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial statement auditing has to meet very strict Australian Accounting Standards and can involve unavoidable unforeseen costs. When the auditor finds something, they're obliged to go and spend money to dig into it. There is no discretion there and there is no discretion about the quality standards they have to meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  Uh-huh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HILL:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you for the noises there, member for Solomon—I feel validated! Although the ANAO has invested in technology and in-house capability to improve efficiency and to reduce costs, it has been demonstrated over multiple terms of parliament that it is simply not possible for the ANAO to bear the cumulative impact of the efficiency dividend without reducing outputs which can only occur in the performance audit program. Indeed, the impact of the efficiency dividend has been the key driver of prior supplementary funding requests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Conceptually, the committee considers that the efficiency dividend need not, and should not, apply to the ANAO. The efficiency dividend is a reasonable tool of executive government, both to free up resources in departments of state and similar entities for new priorities of the government of the day and also to send the management signal of fiscal discipline. Fair enough. But evidence gleaned over multiple terms of parliament demonstrates that it is simply not possible for the ANAO to accommodate the cumulative impact of the efficiency dividend without reducing its performance audit program below the number agreed to be optimal on a broadly bipartisan basis, which is 48 performance audits per annum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late in the last term we conducted the 10-year review of the Auditor-General Act. We went up hill and down dale and pulled apart that number, and it came back to 48. Everyone agrees that 48 is the right number, but, if the efficiency dividend keeps eroding the base, the Audit Office has no choice but to start reducing that number. Hence, for some decades now, an inevitable ritual dance has developed where every few years—we're getting there now—the ANAO moves into a budget deficit and then properly indicates that it has no choice but to start cutting the performance audit program. In response, as part of the dance, the government of the day eventually provide supplementary funding, sometimes with, and sometimes without, political drama.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The application of the efficiency dividend is predicted by the ANAO to have a cumulative budgetary impact of $10.9 million between 2024-25 and 2027-28. This is not a new issue. Back in 2008 the JCPAA commented in report No. 413 entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The efficiency dividend and small agencies: size does matter</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAO saves the Australian taxpayer significant sums of money each year through reduced opportunity for fraud, better accountability and improved agency performance. Saving small sums on the ANAO's budget only costs the Government larger sums later on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll note that, for the record and to be clear, I was not on the committee at that time and had nothing to do with the title of the report!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The value to the Australian government of a robust audit function is significant, as it fosters and drives efficiency, effectiveness and accountability throughout the public sector. The committee notes with interest, and relays to the parliament here, that the New South Wales government permanently excluded integrity agencies from an efficiency dividend, from 2022-23, to safeguard their future independence. It did so in response to recommendations by the Public Accountability and Works Committee of the New South Wales parliament. It has been the presumption in different quarters for many years that an efficiency dividend drives efficiency in a sustainable manner, as applies to the ANAO, but this is simply not borne out by the detailed analysis and the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strong and considered recommendation of the committee—and I'm embodying this statement to the parliament—is that the ANAO should simply be excluded from future efficiency dividends. Doing so will maintain the performance audit program at the level broadly agreed to be necessary and thereby enhance efficiency and effectiveness in Commonwealth entities. This approach will also avoid the periodic circus that I referred to and political drama about cutting the audit program—and, believe me, in opposition I dined out on that, and it was a terrific 12 months—before additional funding is inevitably provided by the government of the day. In addition to enabling the ANAO to better absorb market-based cost increases in the conduct of its mandatory financial statement auditing functions, removal of the efficiency dividend will help it to reach that target of a discretionary 48 performance audits per financial year—a number that we recommended be funded, as I referred to earlier, in the Auditor-General Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final paragraph on this point, you'll be pleased to know, is that the JCPAA recognised that, at that time, resourcing of the ANAO was not adequate. But at that point we did not have sufficient evidence to justify a recommendation to remove the efficiency dividend. The committee now takes a different view on this. However, following the additional considerations and detailed analysis that we've conducted—fascinating and scintillating, I can assure you they were—the committee regards it as the simplest and most effective first step in ensuring the ANAO's financial sustainability. In essence, that would avoid the periodic wasted effort of justifying the obvious with analysis and business cases, and the political circus of accusations that the government is cutting the Audit Office budget, before it's inevitably restored. I'll also note that we finalised our analysis and provided that to the government too late in the budget process, so we're not setting any test for this budget. But we are putting it on the record for transparency that, in future years, that would be the simplest way to stop this goldfish-in-the-bowl circus that we seem to have created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got a statutory responsibility to convey to the parliament the following information about the Parliamentary Budget Office. The PBO's estimated expenses for 2024-25 amount to $10.371 million. The committee notes, from the PBO's portfolio budget statement, under the strategic direction section, that its expected resourcing for 2024-25 will make it challenging for the PBO to maintain its service levels for parliamentarian requests, as well as to meet its publication and election related responsibilities. The committee has understood for some time that the principal continuing budgetary issue facing the PBO has simply been the sustained increases in demand for its work across the parliament. It's maturing as an organisation. We have a very active parliament and we have a very active crossbench. That's also coupled with the depletion of its special appropriation fund from $6 million, allocated at its inception, to around $1.8 million now. Although the PBO should continue to meet most of its fiscal requirements from its departmental appropriation, this special appropriation has represented a crucial buffer for it to manage risks to its operational independence in meeting unexpected costs, including the heightened demand for its services in recent years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has supported the replenishment of this fund in previous budgets but acknowledges and accepts the recent advice from the Department of Finance that, as it was created to assist the PBO through its establishment phase only, a new policy proposal is required to obtain additional funding. The committee therefore supports the PBO's request for additional funding of $1.1 million per year over four years from 2024-25, and ongoing thereafter, and the establishment of a $3 million special account to provide a reasonable measure of ongoing fiscal independence from executive government and resources to call upon if needed, subject to appropriate rules regarding access to the special account. The JCPAA confirms its continuing support for the PBO in its role in providing valuable information and analysis to all parliamentarians to better inform public debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Acting Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer for their work in support of the parliament and the JCPAA, and committee members for their thoughtful and detailed consideration of these budget requests. The final word I'd just note is to record in the House proper—we've done this through committee hearings—the thanks of the parliament to the previous Auditor-General. He served as an officer of the parliament, a very rare designation, with distinction for 8½ years. The Auditor-General can be appointed under the legislation by the Governor-General for one 10-year term as an officer of the parliament. The work the Audit Office does is not for the executive; it's on behalf of this parliament, both houses, to scrutinise the executive. Grant Hehir, the former Auditor-General, is one of Australia's finest and most distinguished public servants, who served us with distinction. We wish him well in retirement and thank him also for his work in supporting the committee over many years.</span>

The Department of Parliamentary Services will receive over $257 million to support the work of the Australian parliament through services to parliamentarians and as custodians of Parliament House. This includes additional funding to modernise ICT systems, including broadcasting, and to undertake building upgrades at Parliament House.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the government introduces the 2023-24 supplementary additional estimates appropriations bills. They are Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2023-2024 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2023-2024. These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions made since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook that relate to the 2023-24 financial year. Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2023-2024 seeks approval for appropriations from a consolidated revenue fund of $2.1 billion. This would ensure that there is sufficient appropriation to cover estimate variations relating to existing programs—for instance, changes in the costs for demand driven programs. These bills also pave the first-year costs of measures that were announced in the 2024-25 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides funding to support the following significant items. The Department of Social Services will receive over $1 billion, with the majority of the funding for the National Disability Insurance Agency to provide reasonable and necessary supports for the National Disability Insurance Scheme participants. Services Australia will also receive over $93 million to support the delivery of government payments to Australians. The Department of the Treasury will receive $525 million to facilitate the increase in the grants composition of the $1 billion provided for social housing under the National Housing Infrastructure Facility in 2023-24, with the funding to be targeted towards crisis and transitional accommodation for youth and for women and children fleeing domestic violence. The Department of Defence will receive over $92 million, and this is primarily reflecting the funding required to support defence capabilities prioritised in the 2024 National Defence Strategy and major defence operations that have been undertaken in 2023-24. The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive over $77 million, including over $37 million to support access to opioid dependence treatment and $20 million to support older Australians in receiving appropriate care.</span>

The Department of Defence will receive close to $453 million, reflecting a reclassification from operating to capital, to support the delivery of capabilities prioritised in the 2024 National Defence Strategy. Full details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the portfolio supplementary additional estimates.
